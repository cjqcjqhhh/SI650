Part 2 should be completed after Part 1 and will use some small parts of that code to construct an index and load data.\n","\n","If you haven't worked with them before, Part 2 will expose you to [overloaded python operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-in-python/), which will let you call functions using alternative python syntax. For example, if you're using two Python `list` objects, you can interact with them using `+` to call the equivalent method. \n","\n","In Part 2, you'll work on the following tasks:\n"," - Construct and learn learning-to-rank pipelines\n"," - Add new features for learning-to-rank\n"," - Evaluate learning-to-rank models\n"," \n","Part 2 can be run on most laptops as well. Some of the machine learning models may take a few minutes to train but you are also welcome to run these on Great Lakes.

seen how to develop Learning to Rank models and analyze features. Your task is the following:\n","\n","  - Define _at least_ two additional features to use in learning to rank models. These can be functions that you define or additional options from PyTerrier\n","  - Include your new features in a new learning to rank pipeline using the three approaches we have above to create three new models\n","  - Evaluate your new models against the old models in an Experiment\n"," \n","**Full credit will depend on one of your new models outperforming the best of the initial three models.**\n","\n","You should aim to evaluate your features initially on the `dev` set, rather than the `test` set in order to avoid overfitting your features (i.e., never look at the test set until the end). You can use the feature and model inspection code to give you some idea of what the model is looking at.
