In the colder months the daytime high is in the 30s and the night time low usually does not drop below the 20s.

On weekends the elephant is open from ten to five. Admission chargers are $6 for adults, $3 for children with kids two years of age and under for free. The elephant is a six story structure made out of tin and wood during 1882. James V. Lafferty built the structure to attract tourists to the area and make real estate sales. The structure is just two miles from Atlantic City. The United States Patent Office gave Lafferty the patent granting exclusive rights to make and sell or use building shaped as animals for a total of seventeen years. There were actually a number of buildings shaped as elephants built by Lafferty. The first which became Lucy the Elephant during 1900 was originally known as Elephant Bazaar in South Atlantic City. The name of South Atlantic City was later changed to Margate. Lucy is sixty-five feet high, eighteen feet wide and sixty feet long weighing approximately ninety tons. Lucy the Margate Elephant had almost a million pieces of wood used in her creation. The elephant was sold during 1887. The shape of the head gives her the appearance of an Asian Elephant even though she has tusks which are a trait of the males of the species. Lucy the Margate Elephant has been a number of things over the years, a cottage, business office restaurant and the last tavern closed during Prohibition. During the 1960's Lucy was due to be demolished because of the state she was in. Edwin T. Carpenter along with citizens from Margate formed the Margate Civic Association in order to keep Lucy the Margate Elephant from being torn down. The Save Lucy Committee was formed by Sylvia Carpenter and Josephine Harron, the committee was given thirty days to move the building or pay for the costs of removal and demolition. The group succeeded. In 1970 the campaign to save Lucy resulted in the building being moved and fixed. It became a National Historic Landmark during 1976. In 2006 the tips of Lucy's tusks were turned black when the structure was struck by lightning. Donations can still be made to the committee to save Lucy the Margate Elephant to help assist with her upkeep. The facilities have been redone a number of times over the years to ensure that Lucy is in the best condition possible and ensure she can stay open to the public. There are daily tours given at the elephant which has a museum in the stomach. The main room of the structure has historical exhibits; the walls are not insulated and open providing a view of the buildings framework. Anyone with even a passing interest in elephants or unusual architecture should make it a point to take a tour of Lucy the Margate Elephant if they are ever in the Margate, New Jersey area."

The courses are the design work of Michael Hurdzan & Dana Fry, and the club, which opened for play in 2004, is the flagship of the five-course Somerset County Park Commission System. The Neshanic Valley Golf Club is located on 420 acres of rolling Branchburg, New Jersey farmland. The courses account for 350 of those acres, and make use of the existing land features, while taking full advantage of the topography. The Lake-to-Ridge combination is a par-72 layout that plays to 7,065 yards from the back (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 73.7 and a slope rating of 128 on creeping Bent grass. The course features rolling fairways, an ample amount of Fescue beyond the short grass, wetlands throughout the course, and greens typically guarded by large sand bunkers. The putting surfaces feature subtle undulations to increase the challenge of play. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the Lakes nine include Hole No. 3, which is said to be the favorite of the course superintendent. The hole is a relatively short par-3 that plays to 197 yards from the back tees, but only 148 yards from the Blues. The green is said to be deceptive, appearing smaller from the tee than its 32-yard depth. It features a bit of undulation, however, and is guarded by a long bunker on the left. Hole No. 5 has been called a monster.'' This par-5 plays to 588 yards from the back tees, but also plays uphill and into the typically prevailing winds. The lake sits beside the tee boxes and does not really come into play, but numerous fairway bunkers along the way do and should be avoided at all costs. Hole No. 7 is said to be the golf professional's favorite hole'' at the course. This par-4 hole plays to a modest 388 yards from the back tees, and is a dogleg left with bunkers on the inside of the leg and a lake along the outside right. Approach shots must be accurate, as the green is guarded by a bunker left and water right and long. On the Ridge nine, one of the most interesting and challenging holes is No. 5. This par-5 plays to 536 yards from the longest tees, and is rated the #2-handicap hole. The hole features two fairway landing areas, separated by a long swath of wetlands and trees that runs down the middle of the hole. Approach shots take aim at a slightly elevated green guarded by a bunker right and sloping sides. Practice facilities at the club include a driving range with both grass and mat hitting areas, as well as a putting green and chipping/sand area. Lessons are also available. The club also features a 12,000-square-foot clubhouse with a fully-stocked pro shop. The Grille Room offers sandwiches and snacks to go, as well as cocktails.

"Northlandz, A Quirky New Jersey Stop","New-Jersey","Northlandz, A Quirky New Jersey Stop"," Flemington, New Jersey may not be one of the most talked about places in the state. The small borough, located a little more than 100 miles from Atlantic City, was home to just 4200 people as of the 2000 census but, like many small towns, it has one claim to fame. For Flemington that claim is Northlandz. Northlandz is a miniature railroad, but it's not very miniature. The railroad includes eight miles of tracks and over 4,000 buildings. It was all designed and built by Bruce Williams Zaccagnino, who now operates the tourist attraction along with his wife, Jean. While impressive in size, Northlandz was not intended to be an accurate scale model. Even though some things may seem out of sync, such as too-big buildings or varying sizes of model trains, a visit to the site is entertaining. Zaccagnino made a point to include some bits of humor to keep visitors entertained as they meander through his attraction. Playing on the not-so-perfect scale of the exhibit, Zaccagnino placed a sign that read World's Tallest Outhouse'' on one of the buildings. It's hard to explain the sheer size of Zaccagnino's creation. On his website, www.northlandz.com, there are photos that attempt to do that. As the creator stands in the middle of a portion of his Great American Railway'', he is pretty much lost amidst the sprawling bridges and massive cliff sides that have been carefully carved from plaster. The mile long museum, which sits on 16-acres, features over 100 trains. There are other surprises along the walk to keep visitors entertained. There is a large art collection on display as well as over 200 dolls that have been collected by the Zaccagninos from all over the world. There is even a 94-room doll mansion (doll house'' just isn't an accurate description) that has been dubbed La Peep Doll House''. There is something for music lovers, too. Zaccagnino plays a huge pipe organ at different times throughout the day. The music can be heard as visitors stroll through Northlandz, or they can take a rest and sit in the theater and listen to him play. There is a snack bar with a fair number of offerings and the tour ends with a ride on a 2/3 scale steam engine. Kids will love Northlandz and adults will admire all the work that went in to building such an attraction."

It is on a Barrier Island. The southern tip of the State is only 30 miles to the South at Cape May. The town has its own menus of cultural options. Theater, large concerts at the Music Pier and other events are regularly scheduled at different venues about town. In the summer the Ocean City Pops Orchestra hosts a seaside outdoor concert series on the Music Pier.

The Museum is dedicated to local history. It is closed on Sundays, Mondays and on major holidays. Admission is free although there is a requested donation. Ocean City's history starts when a whaler, John Peck, began using this island as a place to store his catch in 1700. The island was also used for summer fishing by native Americans and for cattle grazing land. In the 19th Century the first full time residents, the family of Parker Miller, settled here raising cattle and farming on what was then called Peck's Beach in honor of the earlier island use by John Peck. Four Methodist Ministers bought Peck's Beach and decided to make a Christian seaside resort in 1879. They formed the Ocean City Association and parceled out the land in lots for residential and commercial sales. It is then that the town began to rapidly spring up. Today in Ocean City, N.J., the mindset of the abovementioned Ministers lives on as the entire town is dry. All alcohol sales are prohibited by municipal law. This makes it unique from surrounding Jersey Shore towns. 2,600 students are in the public school system from kindergarten through High School. The schools have a Special Education program as well as a program for the gifted and talented. There are 15,000 residents of the town. More than 53% of the population here is female and more than 80% of Ocean City inhabitants are white.

The median household income here is about $10,000 less than it is on the average for the State of New Jersey. The median household value however is well above the average in the state.

The Pine Barrens is a 1.1 million acre pineland ecosystem stretching across southern NJ. The U.S. Congress declared it a national reserve in 1978. In 1991, when the Wells Mills County Park was opened, local residents that attended the inaugurating ceremony began to discuss their longing to revive the music and celebration of amongst the pines enjoyed in times gone by. In 1995 the first Pine Barrens Jamboree was organized by the Department of Parks and Recreation and the event received a warm response; 5,000 people are said to have turned out. Since that time the Jamboree has been held every October. Wells Mill County Park is the largest park within the Ocean County, park system. It is located on more than 900-acres of oak and pine forest that pertain to the broader Pine Barrens reserve. A three story nature center coordinates various environmental education programs and events in the park. A display floor and library are housed among the three floors in the center. The Annual Pine Barrens Jamboree at Wells Mill County Park in Waretown, NJ is now a 13-year old tradition. The mainstays of the event year after year are piney'' blue grass, country and folk music, local Pines Barrens crafts and piney vittles'' as well as environmental and historical exhibitions based on the Pine Barrens eco-system and its history. Waretown can be found at exit 69 of the Garden State Parkway. In 2007 it had a population of 1,916 people. The median home cost in Waretown is $367,000. Waretown's cost of living is 19.39% Higher than the U.S. average. There are about 14 students to each teacher in the Waretown public school system, a system that spends $9,311 per student, over $3,000 more than the national average. Most of the housing in Waretown is detached but there are also several sizable condominium developments. The unemployment rate in Waretown is 4.20 percent, slightly below the national average. Waretown sits on New Jersey's coast and is about 36 miles from Atlantic City, 56-miles from Philadelphia, PA and 64 miles to New York. Several marinas are open to locals and the public. Boating and fishing are the primary interests and major economic activities in this town which developed, from 1700 to 1900 around the shipbuilding industry. The origins of the Jamboree, rooted in a longing to promote local culture and identity, indicate a community that values its own and undoubtedly gives a warm welcome to those that adopt Waretown, NJ as their own."
"Pine Hill Golf Club, Pine Hill, New Jersey - A Tom Fazio Golf Course, Situated on the Highest Point in Southern New Jersey","New-Jersey","Pine Hill Golf Club, Pine Hill, New Jersey - A Tom Fazio Golf Course, Situated on the Highest Point in Southern New Jersey","Pine Hill Golf Club is a Tom Fazio design, constructed upon 360 acres of sandy, southern-New Jersey land atop the highest elevation point in the area. The course is heavily wooded, as the fairways are lined with pine, oak, maple, and walnut trees that serve as hazards and also keep golfers secluded from other holes on the course. Water is sparse on the course, coming into play on only two holes, Nos. 14 and 15. The course is situated upon the site of a former ski resort and features holes that provide distinctly different characteristics. Panoramic views of the area even include the skyline of neighboring Philadelphia from certain holes. The 18-hole, par-70 course plays to just under 7,000 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 74.5 and a hefty slope rating of 145 on Bent grass tees, fairways and greens. The course, which opened for play in 2000, has been described as immaculate,'' and also features some links-style elements. The fairways are ample and undulating, and also feature some large bunkers and grassy mounding in certain areas. Hole No. 2 is a good example. This short par-3 plays to 174 yards from the Black tees, 150 from the Whites. It features a slightly elevated tee and calls for a forced carry over a large sand-gully waste bunker, to a green guarded by another bunker on the right. Hole No. 5 is similar, another par-3 that plays to 210 yards from the tips, and features a sandy waste area that runs for about 150 yards up the left side of the hole and along the green. Hole No. 10 is a par-4 that plays to a lengthy 477 yards from the back tees. The hole plays downhill, however, along a twisting, sloping fairway. Approach shots may not find a level lie on this hole, and must play to a saucer-like green that's narrow, long and guarded by two bunkers on the right. Hole No. 17 is the #1-handicap hole on the course, as well as one of its most picturesque. This par-4 plays to 453 yards from the back tees and features a fairway that dips into a sandy waste area at its midpoint. Tee shots will want to land short of that area, then play to a slightly elevated green tucked between trees and guarded by a bunker on the left. Since opening, the course has received several honors, including being ranked as high as #31 on the Best Places to Play list of some golf publications. Practice facilities at Pine Hill include a two-tiered range with target greens, as well as two putting greens, along with chipping and bunker area practice greens. Pine Hill also features a spacious, 43,000-square-foot clubhouse, which offers views of the surrounding landscape and the Philadelphia city skyline. The clubhouse is also home to The Grille & Pub at Pine Hill, which offers a casual dining experience."

"Prudential Center","New-Jersey","Prudential Center, Newark, New Jersey","The United States has more than a hundred different arenas, with many states having multiple arenas in their large cities. The Prudential Center is one arena located in New Jersey, specifically Newark. The arena is an indoor structure in the downtown district. It was designed by Populous or HOK Sport with Morris Adjmi Architects as the exterior designers. The Prudential Center is a newer arena, having opened in 2007. It is the home base for NHL's New Jersey Devils and the NCAA's Seton Hall Pirates. The arena is also used as a home for the New Jersey Ironmen, an Xtreme Soccer League. Locals refer to the Prudential Center as The Rock'' due to the logo of Prudential Financial who has the naming rights. The center can hold up to 17,625 people at one time for different performances. The cost for the center was $375 Million, and it took two years for the center to be completed, with work beginning in 2005. The most the center is able to hold is 19,500 people for concerts. The Prudential Center has the distinction of being the first sports venue to be built since the Brendan Byrne Arena in 1981, at least in the New York Metropolitan Area. The arena had two purposes. One was to make a home for the sports teams mentioned above and the second was to help revitalize the area. Even as the sports arena was being built talk about the New Jersey Devils moving out of town was going on. In fact talk from 1995 when the team when the Stanley Cup stated that the team would move to Nashville. Even after a top season in 2002 to 2003 talk was consistent about the team moving on. However, Newark was able to raise the money for the Prudential Center keeping the team local. Currently top performances at the center or coming to the center include the New Jersey Nets and New York Knicks, David Foster and Friends, the Devils versus Buffalo Sabres, Washington Capitals, and New York Islanders, Miley Cyrus, Devils and the Anaheim Ducks, Seton Hall and Saint Peter's, and Taylor Swift. The Prudential Center is more for sporting events, so very little concerts will appear throughout the year. In the past concerts such as Bon Jovi and the Eagles have opened at the center. A broadcast of Today, the Guinness Book of Records, and WWE have also visited the arena. The Prudential Center has a restaurant onsite for events and special business groups. The restaurant serves gourmet salad, pizza, and a bar menu. They also have ala carte menu items such as soups, meats, and a dessert selection. Reservations are required for all ticket holders and other attendees. The restaurant is just part of the food available. There are also concessions spread throughout the concourse at the Prudential Center offering typical sports fare like beer, popcorn, hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, and Philly sandwiches. Parking around the center is plentiful and ranges in cost depending on the event being hosted."
