Frederic Remington is known as possibly one of the greatest western artists of the 20th Century. It would be impossible to discuss The Eva Caten Remington Education Center without mention of Frederic Remington, Eva's husband and lifelong companion. Kid's Place is devoted to the education of young people in the various areas of art. It is through the studies of Frederic Remington's work that this goal is achieved. Kid's Place offers North Country families and museum visitors unparalleled learning, art, and play areas in the shape of children's interactive galleries and an art studio. Combined these spaces compose is now call Kid's Place! Through the use of interactive displays and activities children at the Eva Caten Remington Education Center are encouraged to develop their individual creative skills. The facilities are equipped with exhibits to capture imaginations, expand their knowledge and appreciation of art, and most importantly, stimulate their creativity. Imaginative games and learning activities related to Frederic Remington's years in the North Country and his endeavors as America's foremost Western artist function as the catalyst from which youngsters can grasp what it means to be an artist and better appreciate their surroundings. The various games, puzzles, and other distinctive opportunities developed primarily with children ages four through fourteen in mind help ignite enthusiasm and energy in the children who visit the facility. The staff has achieved a seamless transition from play to learning. Together with their families, friends, or fellow students, visitors of all age groups will be able to explore concepts associated with Remington's sculptures, paintings and writings and hopefully come away with some new ideas on how to further pursue their own artistic talents. These learning experiences flourish in this energetic, multi-colored and appealing learning space well designed and equipped to make available significant learning exploration possible for kids! The adjacent museum dedicated to the works of Frederic Remington serves as the inspiration needed to get the creative juices flowing in the minds of all the young visitors who enter the facilities. It is through the many paintings, sculptures and writings that the youngsters are challenged to explore the life and artworks of Frederic Remington. The Eva Caten Remington Education Center offers educational opportunities for children that connect to their different learning capabilities and age. The Center seeks to provide inexpensive, creative art opportunities in a period where many such programs are being cut from public school curriculums due to poor economic times and lack of funding. Student groups can participate in carefully designed lesson plans that enrich their experience and understanding of Frederic Remington, the man and renowned artist. If the goals of the Center can be summed up it would be to further grow an environment at Kid's Place, and the Museum, where the youngsters feel at home while being inspired and supported in their quest to fulfill their inward creative skills. Born in Canton NY in 1909, Remington was skilled at bringing the images of the Old West alive on the pages of magazines. The Frederic Remington Museum contains his oil paintings and sketches featuring the Northern wilderness."

"African Burial Ground National Monument is in the Heart of New York City","New-York","African Burial Ground National Monument is in the Heart of New York City","	Located at the corner of Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan, New York, the African Burial Ground National Monument is a tribute to the more than fifteen thousand 17th- and 18th-century free and enslaved Africans that were buried in a 6.6-acre site that sits at this spot, which was once part of the outskirts of New Amsterdam (later New York City). The idea for the monument arose in 1991 after the first body was discovered during excavation for a new federal office building that was to be built at the site. Remains of more than 400 of those individuals were eventually discovered at this location. The previously undiscovered cemetery had been covered with development and landfill since the time of the burials and the discovery of the initial body prompted an outcry by the local African community to build a monument that would honor the dead and draw attention to the plight of early Africans in America. Two years after the initial discovery, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark. In 2003, the remains of the hundreds that were discovered were rewarded with a final resting place at the site, where a ceremony was held to mark the re-interment. Ground was broken for the monument, which is maintained and operated by the National Park Service, in September 2005. A contest was held to determine the design, with the winning creation belonging to Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon. His 25-foot granite monument is entitled The Door of Return'', which references the infamous Doors of No Return, a name given to slave ports in West Africa. Leon's monument was officially dedicated in October 2007 and is considered a successful collaboration of a number of entities, including not only the National Park Service but also the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Howard University, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the African American community of New York City. In addition to the monument, the onsite Visitor/Interpretive Center includes displays and exhibits pertaining to African-American history and culture in New York City and also displays commemorative art commissioned specifically for the African Burial Ground National Monument. Guests may explore on their own or take advantage of ranger-led tours of the center. Located inside an adjacent federal office building, the Visitor Center is open during regular business hours. Also offered through the interpretive center is a 90-minute walking tour that explores the African presence in the early days of New York. Reservations are suggested, especially for large groups. Special events, workshops, and programs for all ages are held year round but especially during February, which is designated as Black History Month. Most activities are offered free of charge."

Other rides at the park in the early seasons included the Mercury Capsule Skyride, a monorail ride that rode about 80 feet above the Boardwalk, and the Neptune Diving Bells, a submarine that plunged passengers into a 50,000 gallon tank where they could watch a pair of porpoises and fish swim by, and the Double Sky Wheel, a double-ended Ferris wheel. A third iconic attraction at the park, the Tower to the Stars, also still stands. In 1975, the city of New York contracted with Dewey Albert to take over operation of the Cyclone roller coaster, which was across the street from the park. Eventually, the Alberts would buy the Cyclone from the city. The historic coaster is still owned and operated by the Alberts, though the land on which it stands is owned by the city. That same summer, a fire destroyed the restaurant, arcade and a number of midway games. The fire turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Astroland. With the frontage of the park destroyed, the amusements and rides were visible from the street and Astroland attracted a whole new generation of visitors. In 2006, Astroland was bought by a developer with plans to redevelop the entire Coney Island waterfront and restore many of the amusement parks. The Alberts' agreement with Thor Equities called for the amusement park to remain open and in operation through the end of the 2007 season. A second deal was negotiated at the end of the 2007 season, allowing Astroland to open for one final season in 2008. The park closed permanently on September 7, 2008. The Albert family continues to own and operate the Cyclone, across the street from the original Astroland. The Cyclone, which may be the single most famous roller coaster in the world, is open daily from noon to 9 p.m. throughout the summer. Cyclone riders can have their pictures taken at the top of the first hill as a souvenir. For more information about the Cyclone and Astroland, call the park at 718-265-2100."

"Atunyote Golf Club","New-York","Atunyote Golf Club, Verona, New York ? the Only Native American Golf Course to Host a PGA TOUR Event","Atunyote Golf Club is the longest of the three championship courses found at the Turning Stone Resort. All three courses were designed by Tom Fazio, and Atunyote plays host to the PGA TOUR's Turning Stone Resort Championship, making it the only PGA TOUR event to be played on Native American soil. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a tour-type length of 7.479 yards from the Tournament tees, and a respectable 6,998 from the Blues. The course features a parkland setting, with gently rolling hills, vast stretches of open spaces, several lakes, some small waterfalls and a stream. The largest of the lakes covers 13 acres and runs along three fairways, including the dramatic finishing hole. The course, which opened in 2004, is said to be a golfing experience that revives the grand old days of the game, most notably in the amenities ordinarily found only at an exclusive, private club. Players receive valet car and golf bag service, personal attention from the Caddie Master, as well as an assigned caddie, and share the same lockers that PGA TOUR players use during the tournament. The course is also conditioned and kept to PGATOUR standards and features some noteworthy holes. Hole No. 6 is a par-3 that brings some of Atunyote's water into play. The hole plays to 185 yards from the Black tees, and 175 yards from the Blues. Water runs the length of the hole on the right, while trees and a large bunker guard the left side of a wide, undulating green. Hole No. 12 is a par-5 with water running the length of the hole on the right. The hole plays to 520 yards from the Blue tees as it gently doglegs right around the hazard. A large bunker guards the landing area on the right off the tee, and several more fairway bunkers are found on either side of the approach. The putting surface may be one of the hardest to hit on the course, as it's tucked behind the water, guarded by a bunker in front, and long and narrow. Hole No. 18 plays to 624 yards from the Tournament tees, and 584 from the Blues, making it the longest on the course. Water guards the right side of this hole, which doglegs left toward the green. Bunkers guard the left side of the fairway along the way, and the front of a wide green that is not very deep. Atunyote Golf Club has received a number of awards and accolades since its opening, including being named one of America's Best Top 10 Public Courses in New York by Golfweek, Top 10 in the USA by Native American Casino Magazine, and a ranking among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play by GOLF Magazine. One of the most impressive aspects of Atunyote is its clubhouse, a New England-style structure that overlooks the 18th green and the large lake running along the fairway. The clubhouse features a Pro Shop and locker facilities, a restaurant and a Players' Lounge with a fireplace, cathedral ceiling, chandelier, and a stained-glass window depicting an Atunyote (the Oneida Indian word for eagle) in flight. Turning Stone Resort also features casino gaming and entertainment, The Spa at Turning Stone, and luxury accommodations, including two AAA four-diamond-rated hotels."

"Bethpage Black Golf Course","New-York","Bethpage Black Golf Course, Farmingdale, New York? the Golf World's Equivalent of a Triple-Black-Diamond Ski Run","The Bethpage State Park is known for its five world-class golf courses, and none more so than the world-renowned Black Course, which has hosted the 2002 and 2009 U.S. Open. According to the State Park Web site, the Black Course is a difficult and challenging course that should be played only by low-handicap golfers.'' Golf reviewers have taken that warning a step further, likening the Black Course to the golf world's equivalent of a triple-black-diamond ski run. To put some numbers on it, the course plays to 7,366 yards from the Championship tees, with a USGA rating of 76.6 and a slope rating of 148, befitting a U.S. Open venue. From the Regulation tees, the par-71 course plays to 6,684 yards with a USGA rating of 73.1 and a slope rating of 140 on Rye grass. The course is one of the last designed by master golf course architect A.W. Tillinghast in the 1930s, and is considered by many to be his finest work. The owners of the land originally asked Tillinghast to create something on the order of the man-sized Winged Foot with the challenge of Pine Valley. Tillinghast complied and routed the course over a sandy, rugged piece of land on Long island to create a layout that features wide fairways bordered by high rough, well-positioned bunkers, and small greens that contribute to the challenge. The course, which was updated by Rees Jones in 1997-1998, is for walkers only, and has that added difficulty, thanks to its grand scale. From its length, to its bunkering, everything on this course has been described as huge.'' Even golfers who stand six feet tall have been said to remark that they feel small'' when standing in a fairway or a massive bunker. Another distinctive feature of the course is its penalizing bunkering, which has been called a thesis on how to bunker a course.'' The fairway bunkers offer good variety, and include the monstrous Glacier Bunker, which cuts across the fourth fairway. Other noteworthy bunkers are the diagonals on Holes No. 5 and 7, the massive bunker on Hole No. 12, and the cross bunker that creates an optical illusion 40 yards short of the 13th green. The greenside bunkers, in particular, are often large with steep slopes that can take a golf ball even farther from the green, making for some very difficult up-and-downs. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4, a par-5 that plays to 530 yards. The hole has been mentioned as being perhaps the finest three-shotter in the Northeast, and Tillinghast himself called it one of the most exacting three-shotters I know of anywhere.'' Golf fans may recall that this hole halted Phil Mickelson's charge in the 2002 U.S. Open when he missed the green on the wrong side when going for it in two. Even more daunting is Hole No. 15, which is considered the most difficult on the course and one of the most difficult two-shotters anywhere. Not only is it a long par-4, but the green is perched atop a hillock and is steeply sloped from back to front. Practice facilities at Bethpage State Park include a driving range and practice greens. All courses utilize the same Clubhouse area, and amenities include a Golf Pro Shop, lockers and showers, a restaurant, lounge, and snack bar."
"Blue Cross Arena","New-York","Blue Cross Arena, Rochester, New York","Rochester, New York is one of the bigger cities in the state. It is well known for its commerce and sports center. The Blue Cross Arena is built on a very historic piece of land. In 1880 the land was used for a tobacco factory. By 1924 the land had been sold to George Eastman, who began designing plans for an 8,000 seat auditorium and opera hall. However, the plans never came to fruition, as the tobacco factory was still not demolished by 1945 when plans were being founded for a Civic Center Arena. In 1951 the factory was finally removed and in its place a war memorial was constructed. It took until 1996 for ground breaking to occur for an arena. By 1998 the arena was mostly constructed and Blue Cross announced the name. The war memorial is still in place, but now there is the event center around it. SMG World was the developer of the project and they have a significant part in keeping the center open. At the Blue Cross Arena there are suites available for businesses and other groups.

No. 4 plays to 525 yards and may be reachable for some golfers if they can overcome hitting their second shot up a hill and onto a plateau guarded by a large, deep bunker. Holes No. 14 and 15 provide back-to-back par-5s, which is somewhat unusual.

The Institute seeks to research, assess, and disseminate information about ecological systems in order to solve environmental problems. The Institute accomplishes these goals in three ways. There is strong emphasis on scientific research which is related to all facets of environmental concerns. Secondly, the Institute is dedicated to making their research findings and data available to the public and government. In doing so, the Institute holds workshops, presents findings to commissions, and leads field trips. Finally, the Institute pursues educating students from the elementary level through the undergraduate level. They seek to raise scientific awareness and literacy in the hopes that a good scientific foundation can solve environmental problems that humans face. The property has a number of hiking trails with public access. There are several different ecosystems which the trails run through such as wetlands and upland forest. The trails are ideal for nature/habitat observation. The Cary Pines Trail is a 1.3 mile trail which leads through several meadows and a glade of pines. Accordingly, this trail is the best for bird watching. The Wappinger Creek Trail is a 1.3 mile trail through a forested area alongside a creek. Connecting trails like the EdVenture Trail and the Sedge Meadow Trail are small trails designed for school groups and workshops. The Institute also can provide visitors with a butterfly checklist which hikers can use to identify and catalog butterflies they may see along the trails. The hiking trails and roadways are closed from November 1 - March 31. Just off of the trails is an area designated Fern Glen. This area is a 2 acre ecosystem bordering Wappinger's Creek. Fern Glen contains chairs, bulletin boards, and trail guides to assist the student or enthusiast. There is a small pond nearby.

"Castle Clinton National Monument in New York has a Colorful Past","New-York","Castle Clinton National Monument in New York has a Colorful Past","	Located in Battery Park at the southern tip of Manhattan, New York City, Castle Clinton National Monument is a sandstone fort that has served many purposes since it was completed in 1811. Established as a national monument in 1946, Castle Clinton was originally known as West Battery and was designed by architects John McComb Jr. and Jonathan Williams. It originally sat on a small island just offshore and was built to defend the city from British forces during the War of 1812. However, this fort and its partner fort - Battery East (Castle Williams) on Governor's Island - never saw any military action. Eventually, as landfill expanded the boundaries of Battery Park, the castle ended up on the mainland, and soon after the War of 1812, it was named Castle Clinton in honor of New York City mayor, Dewitt Clinton. The army ceased use of the fort in 1821. A few years later, it became Castle Gardens, an entertainment venue that, over the years, included an opera house, beer garden, theater, and exhibition hall. In 1855, it became a port of entry for immigrants coming to the United States through New York City. Pre-dating Ellis Island, Castle Gardens - called the Emigrant Landing Depot - served as an immigrant processing facility for more than 35 years. About 6 years after it closed and the facility moved to Ellis Island, Castle Clinton became the New York City Aquarium, long one of the most popular attracts in the city. It eventually closed in 1941 and though several politicians wanted to demolish the building, it was saved and soon became a National Monument. Today, Castle Clinton National Monument is a testament to all it has been throughout the last two centuries. Tours of this historic structure, offered several times each day and led by National Park rangers, inform visitors as to its rich history and allow a look inside. Tours last just 20 minutes and no reservations are required. In addition to tours, costumed re-enactors at Castle Clinton National Monument teach guests about the War of 1812 and profile military life as a member of America's very young Army. These presentations are offered to groups by reservation and are free of charge. Performances are still occasionally held at Castle Clinton National Monument and feature a large variety of music, dance, theater, and other genres. A visit to the castle also provides excellent views of the Upper New York Bay and visitors are welcome to grab a bench and enjoy lunch near the castle. Castle Clinton National Monument is also the departure location for ferries to The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The ticket booth for Statue Cruises, the official ferry to the two monuments, is located inside the castle."

He remodeled the house as his status in the community grew showing that he was an important man. The brick fazade and mansard roof seen today was part of the remodel. In 1901 Zopher died, leaving the home to his son John. John DeLong remodeled the home again to reflect his tastes for the modern styles. The home has been furnished with objects around in the early 1900's. Part of the Chapman Museum contains the SR Stoddard Exhibit. This exhibit is on animal studies of the famous Stoddard who used the Adirondack's for his landscape photographs. There are over 3,000 photographs of animals, people, and other landscapes. Most of the images have kittens, dogs, cows, and one has a frog. Personal Past is also a traveling exhibit at the museum. This display includes objects and archival materials. The materials and objects are of little consequence regarding famous persons. Instead the displays are more about ordinary activities and families. The Chapman Museum began in 1968 when Juliet Chapman gave the DeLong House to the community for a museum. She was a descendant of the DeLongs. In the 1980's the museum was renovated to add more gallery space and collections. A carriage barn had to be renovated and made part of the museum. Later on more space was added to the area for a museum shop, classroom, and lobby. For those interested in the archives there are manuscripts, photographs, and vertical files.

The Department seeks to enhance the survival of such trees and develop better horticultural technology to allow trees to adapt to a harsh urban environment. The Jackson Grove is an area that features yews, oaks, and elms. Recently, the area became home to the Dorothy Hemp Hill Magnolia Collection. This collection includes a variety of magnolias such as the loebner, umbrella, oyama, willow-leafed, cucumber, big-leafed, and kobushi.

"Dam Steeped in Controversy Now Centerpiece of Town","New-York","Dam Steeped in Controversy Now Centerpiece of Town","The Village of Croton on Hudson is about five square miles in size and it is the meeting point of the Hudson and Croton Rivers. Within the town is the New Croton Dam, a popular feature that was built amid some controversy, but today demonstrates the innovation of industrial development. The cost of the dam was $7.7 million, and it spans 2,400-feet in length. The dam provides a whopping 34,0000,000,000,000 gallons of water to the water supply, so it serves as a necessary component of life in the town. Talk of building the dam began in 1880 when the town's Aqueduct Commission began gathering land for the system. A 20-square mile area was needed to build the dam, which was quite a disruption for a small town. In order to have enough land and space, homes and stores were condemned, as well as churches mills, and schools. In addition to the 20-square miles for the actual dam, an additional 7,000 acres were needed for the watershed property. There were even 1500 bodies exhumed from a local cemetery in order to accumulate enough space! This resulted in a lot of anger, legal action, and protests before ground have even been broken for the dam. Construction began on the dam in 1892. There was a lot of prep work needed including excavation, building of a temporary confinement wall, and pumping of water. It was also necessary to haul a lot of the materials to the town for working, like two-ton rocks and cables. It took 36 masons to lay the more than 3,200 cubic yards of masonry each month. Workers were breaking their backs night and day, all through the hot summers and freezing winters. Some days the temperatures dropped to below zero, but workers were required to continue their work unless it hit 20 below. Finally, they had enough and rebelled. They were being paid very little and working very hard. On April 1, 1900, they stopped working. Workers on strike demanded their wages of no more than $1.30 per ten hours be increased. By 1902, the Mayor of New York had insisted there be only an 8 hour work day and work resumed. Unfortunately, numerous problems were found with the dam. Shoddy workmanship left holes in the dam and defective masonry that allowed water to gush through the holes. The core wall was torn down and rebuilt to better standards upon the insistence of those in New York City. Since it affected their water supply, they demanded the dam meet certain specifications. Finally, after a tumultuous start and an equally tumultuous building process, in January 1906, the dam was completed. It was 301-feet tall, had taken 14 years to complete, and was now the second largest example of hand-hewn masonry in the country. Today, the dam is a popular photo destination for residents and visitors. It supplies water to the surrounding area, and is a popular attraction in the town. The area surrounding the dam is used for recreational purposes like kayaking and canoeing. While most take the dam for granted, it should remind everyone of how far the country has come both industrially and ethically."

"Darien Lake","New-York","Darien Lake - Darien, New York - large family theme park","Darien Lake Theme Park Resort is a large theme park and resort located in upstate New York. Originally opened as Darien Lake Fun Country in the early 1900s, the small picnic area and campground has changed hands several times over the years and grown into a theme park that covers nearly 1,000 acres and features 35 rides, including six roller coasters. Darien Lake Fun Country was actually born in the 1970s when owner Paul Snyder added amusement park rides to his campground and picnic area. Through a special deal with HUSS Maschinenfabrik, Darien Lake featured state of the art amusement park rides, often prototypes of new rides that the manufacturer wanted to sell to U.S. amusement parks. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Darien Lake changed hands three times, first being sold to Funtime Parks, then to Premier Parks, which eventually also bought the Six Flags chain of parks. Darien Lake Fun Country changed names along with owners, becoming first Darien Lake, then Six Flags Darien Lake. During those years, Darien Lake added some enduring attractions. Funtime Parks bought and installed the Giant Wheel Ferris wheel that had been built for the 1982 Worlds Fair in 1982. The Giant Wheel still stands as a centerpiece of the park. Also during the 1980s, Darien Lake added entertainment venues, including a performing arts theater and an amphitheater. In the 1990s, Darien Lake added a laser light show and water park attractions. In 1999, Darien Park opened under the name of Six Flags Darien Lake, but by 2006, Six Flags was in financial trouble. At the end of the 2006 season, the amusement park company announced that Six Flags Darien Lake was for sale. The amusement park was sold to PARC Management in April 2007. Darien Lake Theme Park Resort has evolved into far more than a simple amusement park. The theme park does include rides of all kinds, from thrill rides to kids' rides in a dedicated section of the park. In addition, the park features a water park complete with wave pools, a pirate-themed play pool with water falls and wrecked ships''. The biggest attractions at the water park are Tornado, a 60 foot tunnel slide, and the Big Kahuna, a 700 foot raft ride with twists, turns and spirals. The resort offers accommodations in a hotel and in the campground. While the original picnic area and campground is now off limits to park guests, it has been expanded to include 1,200 campsites. Half of the campsites house RV's owned by the park and rented out to guests. The other half of the campsites are available for guests with their own RVs or for campers in tents. The 160 room Lodge on the Lake Hotel features luxury accommodations and room for possible expansion to include an indoor water park.

"Empire State Building is One of New York's Most Recognizable Landmarks","New-York","Empire State Building is One of New York's Most Recognizable Landmarks","Built during the Great Depression and originally designed as a symbol of one particular company's financial power, the Empire State Building has become more a symbol of American strength and fortitude during difficult times, and remains one of Manhattan's most popular tourist attractions, often attracting upwards of 10,000-15,000 visitors or more each day. The Empire State Building was built in 1930 and was immediately recognized as the tallest building in the world. Its construction was ordered by John Jakob Raskob, the founder of General Motors, in response to the building of the Chrysler Building by arch-rival, Walter Chrysler. Raskob wished to erect a structure that would dwarf Chrysler's attractive Art Deco skyscraper, which was completed just 11 months prior to the opening of the Empire State Building. The architect for Raskob's project was William Lamb of the New York architectural firm Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon. It is said that he based his design on the long, clean lines of a pencil. He was also influenced by the designs of Finnish architect Eliel Saarinen, who was famous for his art nouveau creations. It took just 18 months to build the 102-story, 1,250-foot-tall skyscraper, and a handful of men were killed in construction-related accidents. Records show that the men built at great speeds, completing approximately 4.5 stories of framework each week at the onset of the project. Many of the workers were European immigrants and others included the famous Mohawk iron workers from the Kahnawake Reservation near Montreal, Quebec. As was typical of designs of the time, this Art Deco creation utilizations several setbacks to offset the visual distortion common with a building of this enormous height. Approximately 200,000 cubic feet of Indiana limestone and granite was used for the facade. The stone was rough cut at the quarry and required no final cutting once it was put in place, saving time and pleasing Raskob, who was in a hurry to complete the skyscraper and beat Chrysler. He also proposed that the posts, beams, windows and window frames be made in factories and put together at the site. Most of the 60,000 tons of steel used for this purpose came from steel mills in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and arrived by train or barge. Once the initial 88 floors were completed, the additional 14 floors of the Empire State Building were constructed of glass, steel, and aluminum, measuring about 200 feet tall with a dome sitting on top. A metal-plated tower was originally designed to moor zeppelins but the winds at that elevation made it nearly impossible to accomplish that task. In 1951, a broadcasting antenna was added and the tower was put to use as storage space for equipment. The Empire State Building remained the tallest building in the world until the completion of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1972, which was - in turn - surpassed by Chicago's Sears Tower in 1973. (After the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, the Empire State Building resumed its status as the tallest structure in NYC.) It was declared a landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1981 and was placed on the State and National Register of Historic Places the following year. In 1986, it became a National Historic Landmark. Today, more than 120 million people have visited the Empire State Building. After admiring the ornate three-story lobby complete with an aluminum relief of the skyscraper and eight illuminated panels proclaiming the structure to be the Eighth Wonder of the World, guests generally head to the observation tower on the 86th floor. It takes just one minute to get there via one of the building's 73 elevators. For an additional fee, visitors may board an elevator to the 102nd floor observation deck, which was closed in 1999 but reopened in 2005. This deck, unlike the other, is completely enclosed. Each evening, New York City visitors can view the powerful colored spotlights that illuminate the tower. While the lights are often red, white, and blue, they do change on occasion in commemoration of particular events or holidays or to honor New York City's sports teams."

"Enchanted Forest Water Safari","New-York","Enchanted Forest Water Safari - Old Forge, New York - one of the oldest water parks in New York","Located in Old Forge, NY, Enchanted Forest Water Safari is one of the oldest and largest water parks in the state. Opened in 1956 with just 35 employees and 35 acres, the Enchanted Forest originally had just one mechanical ride - a train that wound its way around the park that featured the Storybook Lane Little Houses. Over the years, the owners added other rides, including a 1/2 mile long Skyride and an amusement park area called A Step Beyond''. In 1984, the small amusement park added its first water ride, a two flume 350 foot water slide. The popularity of Wild Waters convinced the owners to take the park in a new direction. Over the next years, more water rides were added, and the Enchanted Forest became the Enchanted Forest Water Safari. In 1995, the Enchanted Forest added a family entertainment center that included miniature golf, batting cages, bumper boats and go-karts. The year 2001 saw the addition of the Adirondack Expedition, with tube rides, a water activity structure and an action river. By 2005, as the Enchanted Forest Water Safari prepared to celebrate its 50th year, the family amusement park and water park was the largest water park in New York. Today, the Enchanted Forest Water Safari features 50 rides, including 32 water rides. Visitors can enjoy two circus shows daily, or spend the day at Calypso Cove, a family fun entertainment center with go-karts, bumper boats, miniature golf, bating cages, a rock climbing wall and an arcade. The original Storybook Lane still exists, featuring 20 favorite storybook characters including Cinderella and the Three Bears. The Museum of Enchanted Memories, built in 2005, commemorates the park's history with photographs, artifacts and displays. Other themed areas include the Old West area, Dawson City, and Timber Bear's Barnyard, a children's petting zoo. One of the most popular rides at the Enchanted Forest is also its oldest, the only ride that has been at the park since its opening in 1956. The Enchanted Forest Express still takes passengers for a sneak peek at Storybook Lane before dropping them off at the Museum of Enchanted Memories. Perhaps the most famous ride at the park, the Killermanjaro, is a 280 foot water slide where riders reach speeds up to 30 miles per hour. It is located right next to the Enchanted Forest's newest attraction, the Curse of the Silverback. Added for the 2009 season, the Silverback features a 100 foot drop through an enclosed tube into a 40 foot diameter bowl where they'll circle before dropping through the middle into a splash pool. Enchanted Forest Water Safari is open seven days a week through the summer, starting in late June and continuing through Labor Day.

"Enjoy Mining for Your Own Diamonds","New-York","Enjoy Mining for Your Own Diamonds","If you have ever dreamed of striking it rich mining for diamonds, this should be your vacation destination. While your bank book may not enlarge, you may still experience the thrill of finding your very own diamond. Best of all, it makes for a great family getaway. Herkimer Diamonds are a quartz crystal known throughout the world and found only in certain areas of New York State. The crystals are clear and have a brilliant shine to them. They began their formation millions of years ago and are considered valuable because of their beautiful brilliance. Those visiting the Crystal Grove Diamond Mine and Campground can experience the thrill of digging for these rare Herkimer crystals. Digging is a great experience for kids and adults of all ages. You need to have no previous mining knowledge to be successful, nor do you need elaborate mining tools. Just show up to the campground with a hammer, shovel, chisel, or even a garden trowel! There are some tools available for rental, but they often rent out quickly. You can either break the rocks in hopes of striking the diamonds, or sift through the dirt in search of your gems. There are no reservations needed to dig. Diggers are encouraged to protect their eyes and safety glasses can be purchased in the mine store. The park is not only great for mining, it is a great camping destination. It is located at the foot of the Adirondack mountains and the campground is wood and directly adjacent to the mines. Not only will you get to dig, you may get to birdwatch and see beautiful flowers growing. Campers can opt for tent sites that feature water and electrical hookups, as well as fire rings and picnic tables. There is a dumping station, free showers with hot water, restrooms, ice, firewood, and snacks and gifts are available at the shop. There is also access to a horseshoe pit, a playground, volleyball and basketball courts, and a ping-pong table. This is a full-service camping area, and while rustic, most campers will be comfortable here. Cabins are also available for rental. Most of them sleep four people and are rented at $60 per night. There is a two night minimum if it is a holiday weekend. You should make reservations in advance. All camping supplies are necessary, excluding the tent. The cabins feature only beds with mattresses and tables. Once you have finished your diamond hunting expedition, there is plenty to do in Saint Johnsville. Nearby are the Howe Caverns, a thrilling way to cap off or begin a diamond digging trip, the Utica Zoo, the Secret Caverns, Palatine Church, Fort Klock, the General Herkimer Home, the Beaversprite Nature Sanctuary, the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and the Saranac Brewery. Obviously there is something to interest everyone, so even if you are not the diamond digging type, you may be able to make the most of the trip with a side voyage outside of the campground. However, if you have dreamed of digging for diamonds, this is the vacation destination for you."

"Everson Museum of Art","New-York","Everson Museum of Art - Syracuse, NY - Excellent Collection of American Art","The Everson Museum of Art is located at 401 Harrison Street in Syracuse, NY. This location is just west of the I-81 interstate and near the Oncenter Complex in Syracuse. The Museum was founded in 1897 by George Fisk Comfort, a patron of the arts who also helped establish the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC (The Met''). The Museum's first exhibition was held in 1900 and in 1911 the decision was made that the Everson Museum would only collect American art. Everson became the first museum dedicated to this purpose. I.M. Pei, a Chinese-born American architect, eventually was cast to design the current (begun in 1965) building for the Museum. Pei has won the Pritzker Prize and has designed major buildings in Boston, Qatar, Japan, and Paris. The Everson Museum that Pei designed is significant because, unlike museums that are traditionally seen as places to house and store artwork, Pei designed the Everson Museum so that it, too, is artwork. Thus, the building itself is seen as sculpture. One of the earliest acquisitions by the Museum included 76 items crafted by Adelaide Alsop Robineau. In 1932, the Ceramic National exhibition was created at the Museum in honor of Robineau. Since then, the Museum has acquired the largest American ceramics collection in the USA. There are over 4,000 pieces that date from 1,000CE to the present. Some of the artists and pieces collected include: Rookwood, Fulper, Grueby, Tiffany, George Ohr, Newcomb and Marblehead. The Museum also keeps a large collection of American paintings. There are over 700 pieces of art in this permanent collection. The collection features works by Charles Hawthorne, Robert Henri, John Sloan, John Marin and Arthur B. Carles. Several of its more famous items include Edward Hick's The Peaceable Kingdom and Gilbert Stuart's paintings of George Washington. In concert with current exhibitions, the Museum offers frequent films, lectures, and workshops relevant to the events at the Museum. One of these events is the Contemporary Film Series. In February 2010, celebrating Black History Month, the Museum is presenting Black History: Lost, Stolen, or Strayed?, a CBS News documentary from 1968 hosted by Bill Cosby. To celebrate Women's History Month in March 2010, the Museum is showing the 2007 film Persepolis. These events are free of charge and are held in the Hosmer Auditorium. Also in 2010, running from April to July, the Museum is presenting Fantasies and Fairy-Tales: Maxfield Parrish and the Art of the Print. This exhibition celebrates American artist Maxfield Parrish's paintings in printed media. Parrish was known for his vibrant and innovation painting techniques. Docent-led tours are available free of charge in English, French, or Spanish. Group tours are limited to a maximum of 50 guests. The tours last roughly one hour and are given Monday through Friday from 9:00am to noon. The Museum requests that reservations be made minimally two weeks in advance.

"Fort Stanwix National Monument New York","New-York","Fort Stanwix National Monument New York","Fort Stanwix was built in 1758 and was initially designed to guard a port that was located along a major transportation route. The name of the route that was being guarded was called the Oneida Carrying Place. The Oneida Carry was located between the Wood Creek and Mohawk River and was an important element in transportation from the mid 1500's to the late 1700's. During those times, trade routes were extremely important and integral to normal life and the Oneida Carry had been used for thousands of years by indigenous peoples in the area. The fort was constructed under the leadership of a British General named John Stanwix. Its construction consisted of a canon platform, earthworks, barracks, and a quarters for the officers. Many artifacts have been unearthed and discovered from that period that allow historians a better idea of what occurred during that time. Although the fort was erected in 1758, complete construction didn't occur until about 1762. Each year 85,000 tourists attend the site to see a piece of New York military history. The national monument is located in Rome, New York and covers over sixteen acres of land. One of the most important historical aspects tied to the Fort Stanwix National Monument is the treaty that occurred between the British and Iroquois Native Americans. The treaty was issued to define and negotiate what the boundary lines would be between the white settlements and Native American lands. Unfortunately, the Native American Communities and Cultures whose land was negotiated in the treaty actually had no knowledge of the treaty talks at all which prompted further wars and hostilities against Fort Stanwix. Visitors to the historic fort can learn about the harsh conditions endured by the people along the Oneida Carrying Place, and how an American victory at the fort during the Revolutionary War changed the landscape of New York. Besides the actual Fort, the most prominent place in the park is a facility called the Marinus Willett Collections Management and Education center. The center is 13,700 square-feet of time-lined exhibits, event space, audio and visual presentations. The museum collection has 450,000 objects related to the Revolutionary War and the story of Fort Stanwix. The Ranger on duty offers additional information not available through the museums and presentations. Living history programs are also available and provide hand-on activities and a military drill demonstration. The programs are designed to allow visitors a glimpse in the life of an 18th century solider. The military demonstration shows visitors the struggles and events that happed at Fort Stanwix. Fort Stanwix National Monument is currently operated by the National Park Service. The Fort was established as a National Monument in 1935, and later designated as a historic landmark in 1966. By the year 2002, a Revolutionary War Heritage Trail had been added to the fort. Fort Stanwix National Monument is open daily from 9AM - 5PM with the exception of major holidays.

"Genesee Country Village and Museum","New-York","Genesee Country Village and Museum, Mumford, NY","Genesee Country Village and Museum is located in Mumford, New York. It is a living museum patterned on the 19th century. The entire museum runs over 600 acres. Part of the center includes the John L. Wehle Gallery of Sporting Art, Nature Center, Carriage Museum, Silver Baseball Park, and the Heirloom Gardens. The village and museum were established in 1976 as a tourist destination. Since that time they have seen numerous visitors. The idea for the museum was begun ten years before the actual implementation. John L. Wehle wanted to have a place where art and other forms of artistic expression could be offered. He felt carpenters, master builders, and housewrights should be able to get recognition for their work. At the time the area was losing its history because the houses there were beginning to crumble, disappearing into the landscape as it were. With the proposition of the village and museum the homes were fixed up to look like they had been in the 19th century. Some places had to be completely recreated as they were too far gone. Architecture is one of the main purposes of the museum along with cabinetry, weaving, pottery, and other useful artistic creations. The site was chosen not only for its history but also because the land was fairly clear, which meant they could create more homes from the past. Stone fences and hedgerows remain in place from the frontier days. It took ten years for the museum to open in order to renovate and create the homes and buildings of the past. Several masons and carpenters were hired to do the work. The result was a complete historic village with 68 restored and furnished buildings. A simple frontier cabin was built as well as an elaborate Victorian mansion to show how the village would have evolved over the century. Religious and business buildings were also created. Visitors today can see the entire village as well as the artifacts. For example demonstrations happen in the village like 19th century games, quilting, weaving, wool spinning, fabric dying, cooking, broom making, coopering, and woodworking. The village is not just about the buildings though. It is also about the Silver Baseball Park which takes the history of baseball and gives the story to those who visit. The park is also a replica of the first ball park ever created in America. The Heirloom Gardens is yet another different exhibit. In this area one can learn about the different flowers that grow in New York, how they are useful, and also about those that were brought over from other countries. Blossoms, fragrant herbs, and luscious fruits are all found within the gardens. Admission can range from $5 to $15 dollars for most of the exhibits. However, special events may be a bit more. There are also different group admission rates for those who need them. They also have memberships for those who may be more local to the village and museum."

Native Americans referred to the island as Pagganck, or Nut Island, because of its abundance of nut trees. In 1637 Wouter Van Twiller bought the island from the local tribes for two ax heads, a string of beads, and a handful of nails. The Dutch government confiscated the island from him a year later. In 1784 the island was officially named Governor's Island. It served as a military installation for about 200 years until the 1960's. The U.S. government sold the island to the city of New York in 2003. Today it serves as open space, park land, and a national monument. Patrons can visit the island on weekends and holidays that fall on Mondays. The island plays host to various special events, including art exhibits, recreation, and entertainment.

"Greenwich Village, One of New York City's Most Famous Neighborhoods","New-York","Greenwich Village, One of New York City's Most Famous Neighborhoods"," Many, when they think of New York City's Greenwich Village neighborhood, are reminded of what life was like there in 1950's and 1960s. It was then that the neighborhood was a haven for the artists and writers that would shun tradition in favor of nonconformity. Writers such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassady helped give rise to what became known as the Beat Generation. It was the beatniks'' who led the way for the hippie movement of the 1960s. Today, Greenwich Village, a mostly residential neighborhood that is located between Broadway and the Hudson River and from 14th Street to Houston Street, is vastly different that it was during that time . While some landmarks from the Beat Generation, such as the coffee shops that were frequented by the writers, still exist, the people are different. The rising cost of real estate in The Village has ushered in more well-heeled residents that those that would have frequented the area 40 years ago. Today, the average household income of the residents who live in the row houses and condos that line the streets of Greenwich is over $69,000 compared to a New York average of just under $48,000 . While the neighborhood is part of Manhattan, visitors will notice a difference in the layouts of the streets in The Village as compared to the rest of Manhattan. The reason is that when the streets were designed, the neighborhood was not yet part of New York City and, therefore, was not subject to the regulations that forced the rest of the city to be laid out in a grid pattern. While most of the streets in the rest of Manhattan are numbers or letters, many Greenwich Village streets are named. The writers of the Beat Generation were not the only artistic influence that could be found in The Village. Musicians such as Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix and artists such as Andy Warhol also lived in or worked in the area. Writers found inspiration in The Village well before the 1950's. Edgar Allen Poe and Walt Whitman both lived there. The neighborhood is also home to a park featuring an arch (which has been seen in many movies) that was built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the inauguration of President George Washington. While largely a residential community, the streets are lined with shops and restaurants and the area is a favorite stop for many tourists who want to visit the place where some of their favorite writing, music and art was created."

Seward, close confidant and business associate of President Lincoln, who provided the home for her. It was a two story brick home that was later sold to her for a modest sum. This was illegal at the time because Tubman was an African American. In 1836 Tubman led a raid by African American soldiers up the Comcahee River in South America. It was here she met a soldier named Nelson Davis who later became her husband. The Sewards were among those who attended the wedding. They lived together in the Tubman's house until Nelson died in 1888. In 1896 Tubman was able to buy the 25 acres surrounding the land for just under $1500. She was unable to afford the mortgage payment on the land basd on her $20 per month payment from the government, so she deeded the property to the local church in 1903.

The 93,000 square foot mansion is an example of the Oneida Community's core beliefs in the ... possibility of personal and social perfection.'' The home is a reflection of mid-19th century architecture, but is larger than what was typical of that timeframe and illustrates how the Oneida society of more than 300 people were able to live within its confines. Led by John Humphrey Noyes, the Perfectionist Community spent 33 years challenging the traditional mores and customs of society. They sought to change child-rearing practices, gender roles, and monogamous marriage, as well as the common work ethic. They focused on lifelong learning, as well has a vigorous health plan and the abandonment of the self for the good of the whole...'' In 1880 the community came apart and formed a joint-stock corporation, the Oneida Community Ltd. Due to the strong work ethic and industriousness of the members, the community was able to achieve worldwide recognition for their tableware creations. In 1987 a charter was created and a non-profit organization began overusing the National Historic Landmark of the Oneida Community Mansion. This organization abides by certain principles. As part of its mission the mansion intends to use the collection of items and the facility for public exhibition, programs, tours, and special events, all in an effort to engage an audience of any age. They intend o publish documents and research related to the community to educate people, and to offer collaboration with those studying the community. An effort is made to make the site and the collection of iems available to those who want to study, as well as interested members of the general public. They make an effort to preserve the integrity and condition of the mansion as well as the landscape. They also intend to expand their collection in order to create a more complete understanding of the Oneida Community. The collection at the mansion includes cabinets, furniture, handcrafted braidings, books, and costumes. There are more than 30,000 objects. Each of them demonstrates the cultural, intellectual, and business life that was led in the community. Both self-guided and guided tours are available of the house. Visitors will tour the Big Hall, which leader Humphrey Noyes described as an embodiment of life and faith,'' as well as the upper sitting area, and the library. The library contains more than 100 newspapers, journals, and magazines, all used by the community in their goal of lifelong learning and enrichment. Other exhibits include the Oneida Game Traps, the Orientation Exhibit, the Pictorialist Photographs of Harold Noyes, and Sherril, 1948.

After years of being envious of the honors bestowed upon other athletes like Major League Baseball and National Football League players, boxers finally got their due. Boxing had no geographical home, legendary or literal, and there were mixed feelings about where its hall of fame would best be suited. Finally it was decided to locate it in Canastota, New York. Boxing's history has gone unrecorded in many cases. While there are legends and stories of many of the greats, there was no warehouse of factual data as there is in many sports. Canastota had two hometown boxing heroes, and because of this, it was decided to locate the hall of fame in that town. Carmen Basilio and Billy Backus were both from the town and it was the townspeople who demanded these men, and others like them, be honored. Fueled by the excitement and success of these two men, word got around there was a possibility of a hall of fame in the town. In 1989 this plan came to fruition as the hall of fame opening was witnessed by numerous boxing legends including Muhammad Ali. The hall of fame has expanded over the last two decades and now includes an event pavilion and an additional wing in the hall of fame museum. Every June the hall holds its annual induction ceremony which is a four day celebration of the sport, culminating in the induction of the hall's newest members. A trip to the hall is not complete without a shopping spree in the gift shop. Here you will find boxing memorabilia like autographed souvenirs, educational books, and videos, all meant to share the passion people have for the sport. Also included in the items for sale are popular Hollywood items like Rocky figurines and T-Shirts, children's games and books, and gift items like stuffed animals, key rings, and shot glasses. The hall is located in Madison County, one of the best areas of upstate New York. Just minutes from Utica and Syracuse, the county is filled with small towns and villages that are a page out of yesteryear. There are quiet country inns, beds and breakfast accommodations, and a variety of boutiques, antique shops, and farmer's markets. The summertime, when the induction ceremony is held, is one of the best times to visit the area. During your time you can schedule strolls through town and shopping trips, or these activities can offer an alternative to those in your group who are not boxing fans. Families will love spending time along the Erie Canal, boating, swimming, hiking, and horseback riding. You can choose from a variety of restaurants that suit all tastes, and create a picture perfect weekend upstate, all planned around the induction ceremonies at the International Boxing Hall of Fame."

"Innisfree Garden","New-York","Innisfree Garden - Millbrook, NY - Garden and Lake","Innisfree Garden is located near Millbrook, NY. Millbrook is a small village near the eastern-most border of New York State. It was first settled by the Quakers and is now considered one of the richest towns in the state. Innisfree Garden is located at 362 Tyrrel Road, west of Millbrook proper. Innisfree Garden was begun by Walter and Marion Beck in the 1930s. Walter Beck originally planned an English style garden, but this was uprooted when he came across the ancient Chinese artist Wang Wei. Wang Wei was an 8th century Chinese poet and artist. Beck was taken by his aesthetic concepts and decided to develop a garden using the techniques and ideals that Wang Wei utilized. Wang Wei's paintings influenced certain styles of landscape art that featured strong, large brush strokes. Lester Collins, a landscape architect, met Beck in the late 1930s and he began to cultivate Beck's ideas. Beck died in 1954 and five years later the Innisfree Foundation, Inc was created and the gardens were opened to the public. Innisfree Garden was named after a William Butler Yeats poem entitled The Lake Isle of Innisfree. The dominant concept that grounds the Innisfree Garden is the cup-garden.'' This principle was used by Beck and Collins to create portraits'' that are connected via walkways. These portraits include asymmetrical landscape items such as rocks and trees which represent the concepts of yin and yang. The Garden is situated near Tyrrel Lake. Tyrrel Lake is a glacier-formed 40-acre lake that also provides water to a hillside reservoir. The area is a wooded area, with the Garden flourishing in a hollow near the lake itself. The 150-acre Garden features many items that were collected from the local area. Since Tyrrel Lake was glacier-formed, the rocks in the surrounding area are limestone, granite, and quartz and have been strategically placed to accent and highlight the natural beauty of the Garden. Water plays an important role as utility and as aesthetic in the Garden. There are several man-made waterfalls, sculptures, and fountains that are found in many sections of the Garden. Visitors can explore the Bog Garden, The Point, Terraces, and other portraits. The Garden is open from May to October, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays from 10am to 4pm. On Saturdays and Sundays, the Garden is open 11am - 5pm. It is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission to the Garden is $4 during the week and $5 on weekends.

"Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge","New-York","Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge, Basom, NY","The Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge in Basom, New York is halfway between Rochester and Buffalo. It is one of the Western New York must see sites, though many do not even realize it exists. The park is maintained by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The park offers over 500 animals a place to remain safe without hunting or poaching. Iroquois National Wildlife Refuge was created for conservation and education. They offer programs that will explain the different animals and why they need to have clean air and water to survive. There are fish, plants, and other animals as part of the park that shows visitors their natural habitats. The park was named for the Iroquois Indians that used to live in New York. They were the first inhabitants of the area. They were also very keen on preserving their natural resources and keeping a balance with the land. It made sense to those who created the refuge to use the name in honor of the people. There were five tribes in the area, which were eventually placed on a refuge of their own in the 1800's. The land in the park was formed as we see it today during the last glacial period. There is a lake called Tonawanda that was covered by glaciers until the earth warmed again, allowing the ice to melt into a lake. The lake has drained over time to where most of it is just a swampy area. In 1958 the federal government decided to create the Oak Orchard National Wildlife Refuge to help the migratory birds. It is this park that was renamed in 1964. The refuge is part of the Atlantic Flyway for birds. It is 10,828 acres there are remnants of the ancient Oak Orchard Swamp, as well as 268 species of birds that will visit in the fall. Four distinct habitats welcome visitors including forests, grassland, marsh, and hardwood swamp. There are 42 species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. A number of wildflowers will bloom in spring and last through fall, which visitors can see along the nature trails and roadside drives. The park is open all year round with self guided tours or education programs. Children from local schools are often brought out to learn about nature along the various trails. There are three trails called the Kanyoo, Onodaga, and Swallow Hollow. Most of the trails are just a few feet or miles from the Visitor Contact Station. One should stop at the station to get a map and some of the history of the refuge before heading out. Popular overlooks include the Cayuga Marsh, Ringneck Marsh, and Mallard Overlook. It is possible to walk out on the wooden structure to look out at the various scenes nature has created. Feeder Road is also a trail for foot traffic. The path begins in the Kanyoo Trail parking lot and moves towards the grass to the west where a barn and Waterfowl Permit Station stand."

"Kid's Museum for Learning and Fun","New-York","Kid's Museum for Learning and Fun","The Long Island Children's Museum was born in 1989 when a group of parents were discussing the need for a museum suited for children in the style many had seen in their travels across the country. Their goal to ... stimulate a child's natural curiosity and educate them through exploration and play,'' was met when they opened the Children's Museum in 1993. The 5,400 square foot site was a donation from the local energy company and at the time featured only five hands-on exhibits. Once the museum attracted children, they would determine if it was worth expanding. Met by more than 25,000 people in the museum's first four months in operation, they knew it was a success. Expansion plans began almost immediately and the search for a new location was on. Construction started on the new facility in 2000 and took two years to complete. There are now 14 interactive exhibits, three classroom learning studios, a 145 seat theater, and indoor and outdoor gallery space at the museum. The museum provides both hands-on learning through its exhibits and exposure for children to the performing arts. There are numerous programs including daily early childhood program classes, art, science, and music workshops, the Generation to Generation folk art series, and various parenting workshops. Part of the museum's goal is to supplement the learning that occurs in the school system. They have also opened their doors to educational and cultural institutions who may not have it in their budgets to bring children to the space. The KICKstart program features educational experiences for kids, teachers, and families all year long. Galleries and exhibits include exploration of bubbles, climbing, communication, patterns, and tools. They incorporate science, social studies, language arts, history, fun, and learning into one space and give kids a chance to interact with lessons instead of just reading them or being lectured on them. The space is also a great destination for children's parties. Party themes are created based on age and feature events for children aged two through five like Tot Spot and Messy Merriment, as well as kids up to 12 years old like Spy School. Parties include activities, access to the museum, and various food packages. Treat can be brought from home, or for an additional fee the museum will provide pizza, juice, and cake with your celebration. A trip to the museum would be incomplete without a visit to the museum store. Featured at the store are tons of educational toys, divided into categories like arts and crafts, building, nature, music, science, and board games. Prices of the items are listed on the museum's website, so parents will have an idea of how much money to bring along, and what their family can afford prior to a museum visit. You may want to help your child search for a few affordable items online before heading off to the museum. This way they will be excited about realistic souvenirs from their experience.

ORDA operated the Lake Placid Winter Olympic Museum and other select sites. The Winter Olympic Museum is housed in the Olympic Center. The Olympic Center housed some of the actual events of the 1932 and 1980 Winter Games. For example, in 1932, this is where figure skater Sonja Henie and Olympian Jack Shea won gold medals. The Lake Placid Winter Olympic Museum houses several items that were used in the 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympic Games and serves as a tribute to the Winter Olympics.

"Little Italy In Manhattan, New York","New-York","Little Italy In Manhattan, New York","If you want truly authentic Italian cuisine and culture, then look no further than the Little Italy neighborhood, in Manhattan, New York. Located in Lower Manhattan, this area was once the home of a large population of Italian-Americans. In 1850, there were less than 4,000 Italians living in America. However this number jumped dramatically in 1800 to 44,000 and again in 1900, an even larger number emigrated and the population rose to 484,027. These immigrants brought with them values of the old world, working hard and never accepting charity, they came to America in the hopes of making a better future for their families. These early immigrants named Ellis Island, Isla della Lacrime'', which translated means Island of Tears''.  As they began to settle in various areas in America, they banded together in enclaves where they could feel safe and make a life for themselves, these areas were nicknamed, Little Italy''. They set up bakeries, taverns, and people selling breads and fruit from a push cart. Italian immigrants also began to establish various mutual aid societies, one of these was called Sons of Italy, founded in New York in 1905, and by 1921 membership had grown to an estimated 125,000 people. Throughout history, La Familiga'', or the family has always been the core of Italians, it has often been important to sustaining and maintaining their survival. As they became familiarized with their new country, they came to incorporate their core values with American values as well. All immigrants considered their homeland as an important part of their culture and acknowledge their roots, while at the same time they glorified their achievements in America as well. The traditional celebration of the Feast of San Gennaro'', San Gennaro, is the patron saint of Naples, Italy. What was originally a one day religious celebration to honor San Gennaro, has grown to be an eleven day festival. The street fair begins the first Tuesday in September, in Manhattan. It is a celebration of the Italian culture and the Italian-American Community. The historical area of Little Italy in Manhattan extended as far as Bayard Street, north to Bleecker, west to Lafayette and as far as the Bowery. To the north, near Houston Street, is now known as Nolita which translates to mean, North of Little Italy''. Even with the development of Chinatown by the Asians, the area between Broome and Canal Streets, is lined with fine Italian restaurants and is a popular site for tourists and is still strongly identified as Little Italy."

The streets are populated by many ethnic restaurants and even more contemporary art galleries. The neighborhood is a mix of the new and old and is one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city that never sleeps. Orchard St. is the place that bargain shoppers in New York City go to find a great deal. The street is crowded with discount merchants that sell everything from designer shoes to the latest cell phones. Many of the shops are closed on Saturday because of the Jewish Sabbath. Immigrant Jews were among the first people to define the neighborhood and there is still a Jewish presence in the neighborhood. The Lower East Side is also home to New York Cities Tenement Museum which is housed in a tenement in the neighborhood. The tenement museum showcases what life would be like as a resident in Manhattan in the nineteenth century. The Lower East Side Jewish Conservancy (LESJC) includes the Tenement Museum in its walking tours of the neighborhood. The LESJC provides walking tours through the neighborhood which highlight the Jewish influence that made the Lower East Side what it is today. The neighborhood is made up almost entirely of apartment buildings. Most of the residents of the Lower East Side rent, rather than own, their apartments. Owning a car is not necessary for a resident in the area as the famed New York City Subway system can get you anywhere you need to go.

"Madame Tussauds New York","New-York","Madame Tussauds New York - New York City - Tussauds' Tradition Continues in NYC with 200 Figures on Display","In the year 2000 Madame Tussauds New York opened at 234 West 42nd Street at Times Square in Manhattan. But the legacy of the Madame Tussauds' wax museums began in the late 18th century, more than two centuries ago in Paris, where the young Madame Tussauds herself first learned the craft of molding wax images. It was years later, in the early 19th Century, that Madame Tussauds took her craft to England with a traveling exhibition that eventually settled on Baker Street, establishing the first of her wax museums in 1835. Today Madame Tussauds in New York and elsewhere belong to The Merlin Entertainments Group which is one of the top visitor attraction entertainment companies on the planet, with 58 attractions in all spread across 12 different countries The New York site maintains the tradition that Madame Tussauds began, translating the news of the day and top political and entertainment figures into waxen replicas on display for the public. The days of separating visitors from the exhibits with ropes are a thing of the past. Now visitors are allowed to mingle directly with the lifelike makeovers of current and past world leaders and notorious villains. Bill and Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama are among the political giants of modern U.S. politics that can be seen at Madame Tussauds New York.

"Manhattan's Battery Park Neighborhood a Delightful Mix of Residential and Commercial","New-York","Manhattan's Battery Park Neighborhood a Delightful Mix of Residential and Commercial","Stroll through New York's Battery Park neighborhood, also known as Battery Park City, and it's difficult to believe that the area was once part of the Hudson River and the ports that served it. Situated at the southern tip of Manhattan, Battery Park City and the park nearby appear as an oasis in the midst of a big city. The community was developed after Lower Manhattan's shipping ports became largely unused and run down, due mostly to the increased popularity of air transportation in the 1950s and 1960s. During those decades, local government officials looked for better ways to use the area that was once so vibrant. By the late 1960s, architect Wallace K. Harrison was called upon to create a design for the neighborhood. He devised a 90-acre planned community that would be just steps from Wall Street and Manhattan's thriving financial district. According to the architect, it was to consist of light industry, residential housing, and places for social interaction, such as restaurants and movie theaters. Funding was approved in 1972 and the name Battery Park City was chosen due to the neighborhood's proximity to the expansive green area known as Battery Park. In order to begin the project, old run-down piers had to be removed or buried. That was done by excavating more than 1 million cubic yards of rocks and dirt from construction projects already taking place in the area. Much of the rubble used to build the Battery Park neighborhood was taken from the site of the World Trade Center, which was completed in 1972-73. Five sub-neighborhoods now make up the area known as Battery Park City. Four of them are residential with the commercial World Financial Center (WFC) situated in the center. The WFC features four office towers that house some of the world's most prestigious corporations and the complex is also a cultural center for the neighborhood's residents and the city in general, hosting numerous concerts and other arts events year round. The residential areas - Gateway Plaza, Rector Place, Battery Place, and North Residential Neighborhood - boast high-rise condominiums and some low-rise buildings as well, all contemporary in style and lacking the charm of some older New York City neighborhoods. North Residential Neighborhood is also home to Stuyvesant High School, a magnet school for exceptional mathematics and science students, a hotel, and several shops and fine restaurants that cater to local residents, mostly Wall Street employees and their families who enjoy the close proximity to their jobs. Lower Manhattan's Battery Park neighborhood suffered much after the World Trade Center attacks in 2001. Many of the buildings experienced moderate to severe damage and records show that nearly two-thirds of Battery Park City's residents fled the area and moved to different parts of the city, largely due to environmental concerns about dust and debris from the towers. However, since 2005, home sales have increased once again and New Yorkers are moving back to the area."

It is located north of Cayuga Lake, along US Route 20 East in Seneca Falls, New York. The refuge is roughly equidistant between Rochester, Ithaca, and Syracuse, New York. In 1908, Dr. Peter Clark named his home Montezuma, after the Aztec emperor. The surrounding areas eventually took on the same name. The Refuge was established in 1938, and in 1973 the area was designated a National Natural Landmark. Originally, the Refuge was a Migratory Bird Refuge. The Refuge is run by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, under the direction of the Montezuma Wetlands Complex (MWC). The Friends of the Montezuma support the MWC in a variety of roles including restoration, enhancement, and educational research. The MWC services over 50,000 acres of wetlands in the Finger Lakes area of the state. The Montezuma Wildlife Refuge encompasses an area of over 7,000 acres. The Refuge is within the boundaries created by several canals connected to the Erie Canal. These canals run alongside and are filled by waters from Cayuga Lake as well as several pools that make up a large part of the Refuge itself. The northern-most pool is Tschache Pool and the southern-most is simply called the Main Pool. There are over 240 species of birds that can be found at the Refuge. The most significant bird species found at the Refuge is the Bald Eagle. During the 1970s, the Refuge played a major role in restoring the Bald Eagle population. This program was the first of its kind in North America and now there are at least three active nests on the Refuge. Other birds that can be found on the Refuge include: black terns, killdeer, and blue herons. Due to the wetlands geography, the Refuge also sees many waterfowl. During migratory seasons, the numbers of birds in flock range between 25,000 and 100,000. Some of these flocking migratory birds include: snow geese, mallard ducks, and Canadian geese.

Montgomery Place consists of roughly 380 acres of land. It is a riverfront estate, and it has scenic walking trails, rose gardens, herb gardens, orchards, and stately woods. Violetta White Delafield is responsible for the terraced landscaping on the west side of the estate. Delafield was a talented botanist that lived from 1875 to 1949, and she was interested in horticulture. She also created a series of garden rooms for roses, perennials, and herbs, and she also contributed to many of the other landscaping features seen at the estate. The Delafield family made many additions to the estate. They added a greenhouse, a squash court, a clay tennis court, and a hydroelectric generator. In addition, they made improvements to the orchards and restored many the 19th century woodland walks. In 1975, Montgomery Place was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1986, Delafield descendants gave Montgomery Place to Sleepy Hollow Restorations in order to ensure that the estate was preserved. Sleepy Hollow Restorations is now known as Historic Hudson Valley. The estate was then opened to the public in 1988. Montgomery Place is furnished with several items from the Livingston family and also contains memorabilia with Livingston connections. Vistas of the Catskill Mountains and the Hudson River can be seen from the terrace or from the north pavilion. The woodland trails feature views of the forest, which is made up of mixed hardwood and hemlock. These trails lead to the waterfalls of the Saw Kill.

"Museum Celebrating America's Favorite Dessert","New-York","Museum Celebrating America's Favorite Dessert","Those who think there is a museum dedicated to everything are probably right, and this one backs them up!

Exhibits include the relationship between Jell-O and Bill Cosby, famous entertainers promoting Jell-O like Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, and Kate Smith. Admission to the museum ranges from $1.50 to 4.00, and takes visitors through the history of the dessert, from campaign slogans, to favorite recipes. Jell-O was not only developed as a delicious treat, it was a marketing marvel. It was one of the first foods to be f sold by well-groomed salesmen in horse drawn carriages. They took their Jell-O wears to fairs, churches, roadside stands, and parties. Following the carriages were cars decked out in the Jell-O logo, colorful, fun, and interesting. Across the nation billboards and posters would catch the eye of shoppers, all featuring the Jell-O girl and her six flavors of gelatin dessert. All of this and more is featured at the museum. Jell-O was invented in 1897 by Pearle Wait and his wife May. It was by accident when attempting to combine laxative tea and cough syrup. What he created was fruit flavored and May named it Jell-O. He made attempts to sell the product but few were interested. He also lacked the money and experience to get a start up business going around his new invention. In 1899 he sold the formula for his dessert to a neighbor for $450. Frank Woodward was an orator and he had some previous experience being a salesman. His family had lived in LeRoy since 1860 and he had also invented a head lice killing product for hens. Those visiting the Jell-O museum will enjoy a trip through the gift shop. Here you will find magnets, mugs, note cards, shirts, hats, and toys, all featuring that famous Jell-O logo. A trip to the museum would not be complete without bringing home a Jell-O souvenir for all of your family and friends. This is a great way to commemorate a memorable trip to the birthplace of Jell-O dessert. In addition to the Jell-O Gallery, LeRoy is a quaint town, home to numerous shops, restaurants, and accommodations. Choose from dining establishments recommended by the Jell-O Gallery like the Casino Restaurant, the D&R Depot, Ficarella's Pizza, L.B Grand Restaurant, Pizza Land, Pontillo's Pizza, Red Osier Landmark, Woody's Deli, and Scooter's Restaurant. You can also eat at family favorites McDonald's or Subway. If you will be staying in town you can bunk at the Edson House bed and breakfast, or head just out of town to one of the campgrounds. Choices include Southwoods RV Resort, Lei Ti Too, Timberline Lake Park, Inc., or Genessee County Campground. LeRoy is located in the western part of New York State, just one hour from Niagara Falls. This is a great side trip on your way to or from the falls. The kids will get a kick out of the Jell-O and mom and dad will love remembering all of their favorite Jell-O ad campaigns as a kid.

"Museum that Shares Art","New-York","Museum that Shares Art","This museum features a fantastic collection of objects that displays are from the 4th Century BC until present times.

The permanent collection at the museum includes nearly 3,000 paintings, furniture, decorative arts, and sculpture. The collection includes works by the Old Masters including Raphael, Rembrandts, Rubens, and Botticelli. When Mr. Hyde died in 1934, his wife continued to expand the collection. More than two thirds of it were collected after Mr. Hyde's death. Additional works by the modern masters were purchased including Degas, Picasso, Cezanne, van Gogh, and Renoir. She also put together a fine collection of American artwork including works by Homer, Eakins, Hassam, Ryder, and Peto. Even today, the collection continues to grow. The museum is a popular destination for school tours. The educational tours are designed to suit the New York State learning standards in art and history. Group tours are also a popular event.

This rock that fell is now part of the Natural Stone Bridge and Caves attraction, and it is the rock that opened up the caves. Since the early 1970's the cave has been a tourist destination. Geologically speaking the caves were around for several centuries before they were discovered. The last ice age exposed the East/West fault due to retreating glaciers. The stone bridge is 180 feet wide and 62 feet high. It is considered the largest natural marble cave in the United States. During spring water will return to the cave, which makes it change year after year. The water helps eat away at the walls to give it a little something different. It also means that the water levels are marked on the walls to show how high it has gotten to in a year. As part of the cave there is a pool at the end. It was a free natural swimming pool for those who found the site before it was turned into a tourist place. Today the pool is not often seen because one has to go through an underground tunnel to reach Echo Cave. It is a long trip through the tunnel. The tour begins at the stone bridge arch, which was originally named Ponte de Dios in the 1700's. There is a wooden walk way to bring visitors down to the entrance where they are able to get inside. There are limestone formations throughout the cave as well as other cave formations. Since the tour is self guided it is important to stick to the map and not wander off.

Rubber soled shoes are a must, and those with health problems may want to avoid going into the cave as it can be a bit tough in spots. Adventure tours and winter tours are also available. The adventure tour is for those who want to help with the research of the cave. The owners are trying to map out more of the caves to see if it is possible to open up more for the tour. The winter tours are all about snowshoeing along the property to reach the interior of the cave for a hike. For the regular summer tour prices are $12.98 for adults and $8.50 for children. Children under five are free. The cost for the tour is mostly to gain access to the land and to the cave. It also provides the map of the cave.

"New York Beach Popular with Locals","New-York","New York Beach Popular with Locals","Rockaway Beach is a place filled with memories from the locals, as well as a destination for those traveling to New York. It is located in the Borough of Queens on the South Shore. The beach is operated by the city park and recs department, and was once called the Irish Rivera due to the large population of Irish-American immigrants who settled in the area. The neighborhood was once two separate villages known as Holland and Hammels. When the neighborhoods merged in 1878, they became known as Rockaway Beach. The early 1900's saw the opening of a railroad station which allowed people to visit the amusement parks, stores, and hotels that had popped up all over the area. Rockaway was sometimes known as New York's Playground'', partially lending its nickname to the amusement park built in 1901 called Rockaways' Playland. During the mid-1900's, the area continued to grow and added bridges, creating a gateway to the Queen's area. It soon grew into a commuter town. A major player in the town, a man whose construction dreams both enhanced and destroyed parts of Rockaway, Robert Moses created a variety of recreational facilities and areas including the Jones Beach State Park and the Coney Island Aquarium. He was responsible in many ways for luring tourist back to the area and following the 1950's, there was a bit of an urban renewal. It was the building of the Hammel Houses that truly launched this resurgence in popularity. The Hammel Houses were built on land owned by the New York City Housing Authority. These were 13 story buildings that were built close to the beach. The town was now filled with surfside housing which attracted both buyers and renters to the area. These buildings can be seen today on the shorefront, reminding beach goers of the areas rich history. Aside from being a popular tourist and beachcomber destination, Rockaway Beach has held its own in the land of entertainment. The punk rock group The Ramones have a song titled Rockaway Beach and the beach was also referenced in a Dire Straits song. Woody Allen filmed Radio Days on location at the beach and the late off-color comedian George Carlin has stated he was conceived at a beachside hotel. The beach has also been referenced more recently in televisions shows such as Seinfeld and The Nanny. Perhaps most famously, the beach is mentioned in Herman Melville's novel Moby Dick. Perhaps what Rockaway Beach is most well-known for would be viewed by many as a detriment. While people can plan beach getaways to the Caribbean or Mexico and enjoy floating in pristine, crystal clear blue waters, those vacation will never full encapsulate the family feel of a beach like Rockaway. Seeped in New York lure, but also reeking of its seedy underbelly, this beach is a must see for all who travel to the area, and for anyone who wants to recapture a bit of their seaside memories, albeit a bit cloudy. Located in the Borough of Queens, Rockaway is a slice of Americana."

"New York City's Metropolitan Opera a Cultural Gem Inside and Out","New-York","New York City's Metropolitan Opera a Cultural Gem Inside and Out","The foremost opera house in the United States and one of the most renowned in the world, New York City's Metropolitan Opera has launched the careers of many singers, conductors, and instrumentalists. Often mentioned in the same breath as the great opera houses of Europe, such as Milan's La Scala, the grand performances at the Metropolitan Opera have reached opera lovers the world over via televised performances, radio broadcasts, CDs, and DVDs. The idea for an opera house in New York City was initiated in 1883 and the first one was built shortly thereafter at a location on the corner of 39th Street and Broadway. Founded by a group of wealthy business owners, The Met - as it is usually called - first performed everything in Italian, even non-Italian operas. When Wagner became popular, all operas at The Met were performed in German. Eventually, however, the importance of performing these works in their native language eventually became apparent and The Met has adhered to that policy ever since. Early performers at the Metropolitan Opera included Christine Nilsson, Marcella Sembrich, Lilli Lehmann, Nellie Melba, Emma Earnes, Lillian Nordica, and the great Enrico Caruso, the latter of whom performed more times at The Met than at all the world's opera companies combined, despite his world-wide popularity. In 1931, the Metropolitan Opera first introduced its Saturday afternoon radio performances, with live broadcasts aired each weekend from December through April. The first broadcasts were heard throughout the U.S. and Canada. They continue today, now reaching millions of listeners worldwide. In the 1960s, the Metropolitan Opera - which had already outgrown its facilities - joined several other New York cultural institutions to form the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and the building of a new facility was now deemed a possibility. The new Metropolitan Opera opened as the centerpiece of Lincoln Center in 1966, boasting world-class acoustics and a highly-mechanized stage with multiple elevators. It quickly earned fame as a premiere opera venue. Designed by architect Wallace K. Harrison, the outside of the building is clad in white travertine and features 5 graceful glass arches which allow visitors to take a peek inside at the grand red-carpeted spiral staircases that lead to the 3,800-seat theater, decorated in deep red and gold. The lobby also features ornate Austrian crystal chandeliers, and enormous works of art by modernist Belarusian-French artist Marc Chagall sit on either side of the staircase. In 1995, The Met added yet another technical innovation to its theater with the addition of Met Titles'', a simultaneous translation system that allows viewers to read the English translation of foreign operas while watching the production. This is done by means of computerized screens mounted in small railings at the back of each row of seats.

"New York State Capitol","New-York","New York State Capitol - Albany, NY - Capitol Building of New York State","The Capitol Building is located on State Street in Albany, NY. State Street, formerly called Yonker Street, is the oldest street in Albany and its original main street.'' In 1797, Albany became the permanent capitol of the state. The Capitol Building took thirty-two years to build and was completed in 1899. It was developed by a team of five architects and, at its completion, cost roughly $25 million dollars. The two main architects of the project were Leonard Eidlitz and Henry Hobson Richardson. Richardson made the style Richardson Romanesque famous by experimenting with it for a sanitarium in Buffalo, NY. This style incorporates semi-circular and rounded arches, thick walls, and large towers. The exterior of the building is made of white granite and marble, and is 220 feet tall at its highest point. Original plans called for a dome, but finances terminated that goal. As such, the Capitol is one of ten state capitols that do not have a dome. The largest room in the building is the Assembly Room. This room originally had a sandstone vaulted ceiling that was over 50 feet high. Eventually, this was replaced with a lower ceiling. The building also contains three massive staircases. Eidlitz designed the Senate and Assembly staircases. The more famous Great Western Staircase was designed by Richardson. This staircase, also known as the Million Dollar Staircase, has 444 steps. The most striking feature is the 77 faces'' carved into the walls alongside the staircase. Over 500 stoneworkers produced these carvings which include G. Washington, A. Lincoln, U. Grant, and S. B. Anthony. The Senate Chamber room was designed by Richardson. It features a golden oak ceiling with recesses to allow for magnifying acoustics. Richardson imported materials from around the world to create this room including red granite from Scotland and onyx from Mexico. The walls have 23 carat gold leaf band on them as well. Richardson also designed the Executive Chamber, which is nicknamed the Red Room because of its original red drapery and carpeting. Akin to the Senate Chamber, the Executive Chamber has chandeliers and gold leaf bands on the walls. The walls themselves are mahogany and oak. The desk in the room is seated on a platform. The Capitol Flag Room is located on the first floor near the East Entrance. This room displays over 1,000 different flags contained in large cases. Some of the flags on display include: Civil War, Spanish-American War, and flags from the World Wars. Regimental flags from the Battle of San Juan Hill and 37th All Irish Regiment, and the Civil War 20th and 26th Regiments are also on display. Tours are conducted of the building Monday through Friday at 10, 12, 2, 3 and 3:45. On Saturdays tours are run at 11, 1 and 3. The Capitol is closed on Sundays and holidays. Groups of more than ten are requested to make a reservation by calling 518-474-2418. The tour lasts roughly 50 minutes and begins at the Visitor Center in the Plaza. The tours are free of charge."

Situated just a short distance from Flanders Bay and a number of other Riverhead-area attractions, Out East Family Fun is a great warm weather place to spend a day. Open from Memorial Day through Labor Day, this park includes a number of both wet and dry attractions and a little something for both children and adults. The centerpiece of the park is The Hippo, touted as the world's largest inflatable water slide. This gargantuan slide soars up to three stories high, providing sliders with great views of the surrounding area. The drop measures forty degrees and is a thrill for all ages and dubbed safe for everyone. The most popular attraction in the park, The Hippo generally sports a long line, which moves rather quickly, and lots of repeat riders. For more opportunities to cool off, guests can also visit Water Wars. Here, players can take turns launching water balloons at one another, hoping to get their opponent wet. Recently added was a new twist to the Water Wars attraction called the Depth Charge''. A direct shot to the target above the opponents' tower releases a blast of water, providing a huge soaking for those underneath. This is a favorite attraction during the hot New York summers. For those who prefer to stay dry, there are three activities from which to choose. The Batting Cages are designed with the Little Leaguer in mind. Pitching includes three speeds for baseball as well as fast and slow pitch softball. Patrons pay a fee per each set of 10 pitches. In addition, guests of all ages can check out Jump Shot Basketball. This fast-paced game features a trampoline court that allows lots more slam dunks and a whole lot more fun for participants. The third dry activity is miniature golf, appropriate for everyone from pre-schoolers on up.

Out East Family Fun does not have a general admission fee that allows access to all of the attractions. Rather, patrons pay per use. Access to The Hippo includes the purchase of a one-slide ticket or a wristband that allows either multiple slides or unlimited slides during a designated period of time.

Guests can purchase a 1, 5, or 10 ticket package for this attraction. Mini golf is priced per round and jump shot basketball requires 1 ticket per each 3 minutes of play. Multiple tickets may be purchased at a reduced price. The batting cages require the purchase of a token, which provides 10 pitches of the batter's choice.

At the time, it was the highest hotel in the Catskills. The Overlook Mountain House was able to hold 300 guests. The current Overlook Mountain House was actually the third hotel to be built on the mountain. The original hotel was destroyed in 1875 by a fire. The hotel was then rebuilt in 1878. Again, the hotel was destroyed by a fire (in 1923). Frank Amato was then hired to redesign and rebuilt the hotel. It was rebuilt using concrete, but the hotel was never actually completed. The owner, Morris Newgold, was having financial difficulties. In 1940, the hotel was boarded up. It was again damaged by a fire in 1941. Another fire in the 1960s destroyed even more of the structure. The ruins of the Overlook Mountain House are still visible today. Another site popular with visitors is the fire tower.

Long Island City is located in the borough of Queens in New York City. The Center is located at 22-25 Jackson Ave at the intersection of 46th Avenue, just south of the John F. Murray Playground. The Center was founded in 1971 by Alanna Heiss. Heiss was one of the forerunner's of the alternative space movement, which endeavored to convert atypical locations into areas for art exhibition. Heiss believed that traditional exhibition sites did not offer sufficient space and settings for contemporary artists. She opened the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in a 125,000 square foot building that had formerly housed one of Long Island City's oldest schools. The Center focuses its resources on displaying experimental art and seeking out innovative and new artists. For its first twenty years, the building was used as both a studio and exhibition center. In 1997, the building was reopened after renovations. The Center qualifies as a non-profit organization and receives aid from private donors, government programs, and funding through corporations. In 2000, the Center became affiliated with the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). This affiliation serves to expand the audience for contemporary art, encourage new contemporary artists, and collaborate on a variety of related projects. The Center has a number of long-term exhibitions. These include Richard Artschwager's Blips, and Don't Fight City Hall. Other artists with work in the Center include Lawrence Weiner, Keith Sonnier, James Turrell, and Alan Saret. These exhibitions are throughout the building and have been joined in the past by works by Janet Cardiff, Robert Grosvenor, David Hammons, Dennis Oppenheim, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Katharina Sieverding, and Franz West. In 2009, the Center welcomed the works of Kenneth Anger, a filmmaker whose art depicts radical critique of Hollywood. Anger's avant-garde cinema skills were portrayed on the second floor of the building amidst red and silver partitions which highlighted Anger's use of vibrant colors. In conjunction with MoMA, the Center holds the annual Young Architects Program (YAP) competition. This program started in 2000 and is designed to allow architects to build outdoor art for the courtyard of the building. The competitors are selected by the deans of architectural schools and editors of architectural publications. A final selection is made in February.

"Palisades Center","New-York","Palisades Center - West Nyack, New York - large indoor shopping center","Located in West Nyack, New York, the Palisades Center is the 10th largest shopping center in the entire country. It encompasses over 2.2 million square feet located on four stories of retail stores, dining establishments and entertainment facilities. Opened in March 1998, Palisades Center was developed by The Pyramid Companies and is still owned and operated by them. The Palisades Center, also known as the Palisades Mall, is built around a 150-year-old cemetery, the Mount Moor Cemetery. The Mount Moor Cemetery was established in 1849 by a deed of land from James and Jane Benson to three trustees. Its stated purpose was to provide a final resting place for colored people'', including Native Americans and African Americans who were veterans of United States wars from the Civil War to the Korean War. The cemetery is visible from several vantage points in the mall and is undisturbed by construction. Shortly after the Palisades Center opened in 1998, a rumor began circulating that the structure was built on swampland that was not properly filled, and that as a consequence, the mall's foundation is sinking. In response, the mall owners jokingly painted depth markers'' on the north side of the mall to scotch the rumors. The mall is built on four stories and features sixteen anchor stores, which include Macy's, Lord & Taylor, BJ's Wholesale Club, Best Buy, Staples, Home Depot and J.C. Penney. Including the sixteen anchor stores, the Palisades Center is home to over 400 stores and services that range from dollar stores to a Thomas Kinkade Gallery. In addition to the stores, visitors to the mall can spend a few hours skating on the ice rink located on the fourth floor above Macy's, or enjoy a movie or show at the AMC or IMAX theaters located at the mall's combination food court and entertainment center. The third floor food court is built around a Ferris wheel and a carousel. The current carousel is being updated and is scheduled to be replaced by a new double-decker carousel. The original carousel was made by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Palisades Center offers multiple options for dining, both in food courts and in scattered restaurants and dining facilities. The dining options include many national chains - TGIFridays, Dave & Buster's, Chevy's TexMex, Chili's, Outback Steakhouse and The Cheesecake Factory.

"Ralph Wilson Stadium","New-York","Ralph Wilson Stadium - Buffalo, New York - Home to the NFL's Buffalo Bills","Ralph Wilson Stadium, formerly named Rich Stadium, is the exclusive home field to the NFL's Buffalo Bills. Located in Orchard Park, a Buffalo suburb, it is the largest stadium in New York State. The first game held at Ralph Wilson Stadium was between the Bills and the Washington Redskins. Ralph Wilson Stadium, also known as the Ralph'', became the home of the Buffalo Bills in order to replace the old Buffalo War Memorial Stadium, which, while still usable, was far too small for an NFL team. The team almost relocated to Seattle, but instead opted to stay in New York with the construction of a new venue. The stadium received its current name after a 25-year contract signed in 1973 with Rich Foods expired. Rich Foods had paid $1.5 million a year for the naming rights until 1998, when the name was changed to honor Ralph Wilson, founder and owner of the Bills. Owned and operated by Erie County, NY, the stadium originally cost $22 million to build. The stadium was renovated several times over the years, with one of the more significant renovations happening in 1998, when the seating capacity was reduced from 80,202 to 73,967. This was due to a lease renewal, but ultimately resulted in larger seats for fans, as well as additional luxury and club seating. These renovations amounted to $63 million. The architect in charge of designing Ralph Wilson Stadium was HNTB. Ralph Wilson Stadium offers fans 12,000 on-site parking spaces, as well as 42 concession stands, and 46 restrooms. In 2007, a high-definition LED board, made by Mitsubishi, was installed to replace the old Sony JumboTron. The new board is 88.8' x 32.5', much larger than the original (41.5 x 31.5) that displayed in the stadium for 13 years. Lining the field is AstroPlay, a synthetic grass type of playing surface. It is has an open roof, as opposed to being sheltered by a dome. Across from the Native Pride Camper Lot is a bathhouse facility that welcomes guests with changing areas, restrooms, and showers. Due to the high winds of the Buffalo area, the open-roofed Ralph Wilson Stadium proves to be a difficult venue for kickers. Of course, the unique design of the stadium doesn't help, as it pulls the wind in, making conditions even trickier. Although Ralph Wilson Stadium is exclusive to the Bills, other events have been held within its walls. On January 1, 2008, the Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins NHL teams played a game in the NHL Winter Classic. The venue has also been the site of the Drum Corps International Championships three times. Along with this, a number of concerts have been held at Ralph Wilson Stadium, with big names such as The Who, Van Halen, Foreigner, Billy Joel, and Guns N'Roses performing there. Bruce Springsteen would have been the last musician to perform at Ralph Wilson Stadium, but the show was relocated due to poor ticket sales. Since 2001, Ralph Wilson Stadium has yet to host another concert."

Because it was run by a healthcare organization, the spa emphasized not only relaxation and pampering, but also had a medical aspect to it as well. A few small offices were rented by local doctors who were readily available to tend to the spa's patrons, providing a special service that most spa clients would be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. But though the hospital affiliation is gone, River Rock Spa still endeavors to cater to the whole body. Decorated in bamboo and light woods, with waterfalls and the soothing colors of the ocean rounding out the d,cor, River Rock Health Spa provides an attractive, stress-free environment that appeals to busy New Yorkers who need time to chill out every now and then. In line with the town's folksy feel, everything here is natural or organic, from the linens to the skin care products used by the technicians. The emphasis on being green'' continues even when the patrons are gone with the use of natural cleaning products, energy saving lighting, and much more. The menu of services at Woodstock's River Rock Spa is diverse and is suitable for both sexes. As a matter of fact, the spa notes that more than 30 percent of its clients are male, which is higher than most spas, but being male-friendly was one of the goals for the spa when it was being designed. Boasting a large staff, 9 treatment rooms, 4 private steam and sauna units, and a relaxing lounge, River Rock Health Spa has plenty of space and manpower to provide a large variety of therapies. The menu starts with a long list of facials, including the classic European variety as well as others designed specifically for men, mothers-to-be, and those with aging skin. Microdermabrasion for face and body is also available. Other body treatments include scrubs, wraps, and hand- and feet-smoothing therapies. Massages make up a large number of the treatments scheduled at River Rock Spa in Woodstock.

"Sag Harbor Whaling and Historical Museum","New-York","Sag Harbor Whaling and Historical Museum - Sag Harbor, NY - Sag Harbor History","The Sag Harbor Whaling and Historical Museum is located at 200 Main Street in Sag Harbor, NY. The village was settled in the early 1700s and quickly became a major sea port with international ships docking there. The whaling industry developed quickly. One of the major industries was whale oil made from the blubber of whales. The village is even mentioned in the famous literary work Moby Dick. The building the Museum occupies was built in 1845 by Benjamin Huntting, a prominent owner of whaling industry ships. Huntting hired architect Minard LaFever who specialized in Greek Revival architecture. The Corinthian columns of the structure represent that tradition. In 1945, the building was given to historical society for use as a museum. The Museum has a permanent collection of artifacts and documents related to the whaling industry and related culture of the Whaling Era. One of the more popular displays includes the items from the whaling voyages like spears, shields, and paddles. There are four galleries which display various materials related to the Whaling Era. The harpoon rooms and the parlors contain main other items from the 19th century including household items and portraits. The Orientation Gallery serves as an historical overview to the industry and time-period to introduce the Museum's collection to visitors. In 2003, the Museum began a new gallery that would display annual exhibits related to the maritime industry. In 2005, the Museum hosted the Island Kings, Whalers & Beach Boys exhibit which suggested that Pacific whaling influenced surfing. In 2009, the summer exhibit was on oil. The exhibit examined the history of oil (both petroleum and whale oil) and offered considerations on future uses of oil products including renewable sources. Each year the Museum hosts an Old-Fashioned Lobster Bake. All proceeds benefit the Museum and tickets can be pre-purchased. In 2010, the Museum will celebrate its 15th annual bake. This fundraising bake offers a variety of seafood for patrons to enjoy. In the center of the building, underneath the staircase, is the gift shop.

"Salt Museum","New-York","Salt Museum, Liverpool, NY","Liverpool, New York has a few attractions that will bring visitors to their doors. One place is the Salt Museum. The Salt Museum is along a lake in Onodaga County. Though the mine is no longer in use one can still smell the odor of the salt marsh on summer days. The museum is a place that depicts the history of the salt marsh and its mining. The exhibits which are part of the museum are in one building which used to belong to the old salt warehouses. The building like its artifacts is rather old which adds to the history of the place. It has been renovated a little bit to make it habitable, but it still keeps its old rustic charm. Represented throughout the whole museum is the extraction of salt ranging from how it was discovered, to what tools were required, and why it was eventually given up. Even though one can say that this area contained salt mines, it actually took very little mining to gain the salt. The salt was so prevalent on the surface one didn't really need to dig too hard. It also made the process fairly dull as they used boiling kettles with Onodaga Lake Brine to get the salt. The most important exhibit is the boiling block. This block is a floor with a dozen sunken kettles. The scene in the museum has cutouts of men who stand there with big wooden ladles. They depict how the salt water would be stirred in order to get the salt out of the water. The museum also states that the task of the salt boiler was fairly dangerous because of burns from splashing brine or if they accidentally fell into the boiling kettles. These kettles were definitely not small. To reach the museum one must travel to Onodaga Lake Parkway in Liverpool, New York. It is possible by taking I-90 to Route 370 and on to the Parkway. The hours will differ from season to season, and it is typically open during the summer the longest. There is a small price to see the museum. Those who do travel to Liverpool and its Salt Museum also take advantage of the beauty surrounding the area. It is possible to walk near the lake and just explore the outdoor world. However, it will not take all day to visit the museum. This means visitors might wish to head to the Muffler Man, Victorian House atop a Factory, Green on Top Traffic Light or the Pink Elephant which are all in the same area. The museum is based on the 1700's and 1800's when salt mining in New York was very popular. The Erie Canal and other places near Syracuse, New York were targets for salt mining. Even such things like the famous salt potatoes will be explained at the museum for visitors. Syracuse is still well known for these potatoes so visitors can even try one if they have a mind, though they are very small potatoes."

"Saratoga National Golf Club","New-York","Saratoga National Golf Club, Saratoga Springs, New York- a Public Golf Course With a Private Club Atmosphere","Saratoga National Golf Club is a Roger Rulewich design, located on 400 acres of land near Lake Lonely in Saratoga Springs, New York. Rulewich, who designed the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail in Alabama and is known for creating playable courses, took advantage of the existing wetlands and natural features of the property to craft the course. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2001, plays up to 7,250 yards from the Professional Tees, with a USGA rating of 74.5 and a slope rating of 143 on Bent grass. For the most part, the main feature of course is a relatively flat layout with numerous marshlands and water hazards that create a lot of forced carries off the tee. The front nine holes are primarily secluded in woodlands, while the back nine holes feature much more water. The greens are also some of the largest in the area and have been described by some reviewers as larger than the fields many kids grow up playing touch football on.'' While the course has received a good deal of hype, some golf reviewers have come away less than impressed, calling Saratoga National essentially a resort course'' that tries to create a private club atmosphere. For example, the course doesn't have any hole markers, just tiny green signs on the ground that point players toward the next tee. While that may work nicely for regular club members, visitors to the course may find themselves getting lost between holes. Some of the more noteworthy holes on the course include Nos. 4 through 7, which has been described as an interesting stretch of holes. Hole No. 4 plays to 550 yards from the back tees and requires a forced carry over a large wetland off the tee. From there, the fairway winds through trees, eventually playing to a large, elevated green that's guarded by a sprawling bunker on the left and mounded rough on the right. Hole No. 5 is the first par-3 players encounter, and plays to a lengthy 238 yards from the longest tees. The hole features a carry over more wetlands to a large, undulating green that's guarded by an expansive bunker and a sloping fescue mound on the left. Hole No. 10 has been described as cool,'' especially when there's a crowd sipping drinks on the wrap-around clubhouse balcony keeping watch. This par-5 plays to 552 yards from the back tees, and players must cross two streams on the way to a sprawling, contoured green that's protected by two bunkers. Hole No. 13 has been described as a watery grave,'' another par-5 where water awaits on just about every swing. The fairway is essentially a series of landing areas surrounded by water, followed by an approach to a peninsula green nestled amid a limestone rock fortress. Hole No. 15 is the postcard'' hole for the course, a par-3 that plays to an island green situated on the shore of Lake Lonely. The putting surface is 50 yards wide and guarded by another limestone wall and two bunkers, one of them a pot bunker. Accolades for the course include being named the #27 among Best Courses in New York by Golf Digest in 2007-2008, and #91 among America's Best 100 Public Courses by the same publication. Golfweek Magazine ranked Saratoga National #3 Best Golf Course in New York in 2006, while GOLF Magazine Travel called it better than most private clubs.'' Practice facilities are included in the daily use fee and include multiple target greens, a fairway bunker, a short-game area that includes greenside bunkers, as well as an 8,000-square-foot putting green. The club also features a mansion-like, 33,000-square-foot clubhouse, with locker rooms, private showers and a full-time attendant.

"Seabreeze Amusement Park","New-York","Seabreeze Amusement Park - Irondequoit, New York - traditional amusement park in upstate New York","Located just outside of Rochester, New York, Seabreeze Amusement Park is one of the oldest amusement parks still in operation in the United States. It is home to the Jack Rabbit, the fourth-oldest roller coaster in the world, as well as a number of other traditional amusement park rides and attractions. Today, the park has a total of 70 rides, including a number of water rides. Originally, Seabreeze Amusement Park was opened as a trolley park, which helped encourage guests to travel the rails. It featured a picnic grove along a lake, but by 1900, there were dozens of mechanical rides and other attractions at the park, which helped it survive even as other trolley parks shut down. The oldest ride still at the park is the centerpiece of the center grounds - the carousel. Brought to the park in 1915, this carousel almost completely burned down in 1994. The park owners salvaged what they could and commissioned a new carousel to be built, replicating the old one and using all hand-made parts. The Jack Rabbit, along with the park's other roller coasters, is a main attraction at Seabreeze Amusement Park. This coaster is wooden and reaches speeds of up to 50 miles per hour. When it was introduced in 1920, it was the fastest roller coaster in the world. Other roller coasters at the park include the Whirlwind, a spinning coaster that is one of the newest additions to the park, and Bear Trax, a kiddie coaster that's perfect for younger guests. The park also has an innovative ride called Bobsleds. This coaster design is unique to the park and was built by its owners, the Long family, in the late 1960s. Seabreeze Amusement Park has a number of other rides as well, including bumper cars, the Sea Dragon pirate ship, a log flume, teacups, a train that loops around the park, and a tilt-a-whirl. In addition, the park is home to a children's area with a number of kiddie rides, such as the Barnstormers bi-planes, boats, swings, and jets. Guest who want to cool off can also visit the water park area, which has a wave pool, body flume, inner tube slide, and more. Before leaving, visitors can also check out the Cirque En Vol show, a daily show featuring acrobats, clowns, and other stunt performers.

"Secret Caverns","New-York","Secret Caverns, Cobleskill, NY","The Secret Caverns lodge is five miles east of Cobleskill, NY off US Route 7. This places it just 35 miles west of Albany, NY. The caves are open daily Mid-April through November 1st from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, June, July and August from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm and May and September from 10:00 am to 4:30 pm. Prices for adults are $16.00, children ages 6-15 are $8.00 and children less than 5 are free. Strollers are not allowed in the caves and front packs must be used very cautiously. A tour of the caves is 1/2 mile and takes around an hour to complete. There are guided tours with approximately twenty people and they leave the entrance to the cave every fifteen or twenty minutes. Visitors to the cave must be able to climb stairs as the walking tour descends into the cave with 103 steps before meeting up with the concrete walkway. The temperature of the cave stays around 50 degrees so a light weight jacket or sweater is recommended as are comfortable walking shoes. The Secret Caverns were discovered by local farmer, Leon Lawton in 1928 when two of his cows wound up at the bottom of the entrance. Word of the caves discovery reached the notice of Roger Mallery who was a local civil engineer. Mr. Mallery enlisted the help of five local teenagers that were interested in the hobby of spelunking. They went into the entrance with 85 feet of rope and flashlights to explore the cave. They had to crawl on their stomachs for 200 feet in cold water and mud before they got to the inner chambers where they could finally stand up. There the group found high ceilings, winding trails and a 100 foot waterfall. Mr. Mallery decided to explore the cave himself after that and it wasn't long before he purchased the land and opened it up to other spelunkers for 0.40 a trip. These first explorers were issued a hundred feet of rope, a flashlight, helmet, and lunch. The first trips were unguided and could last up to six hours. It would be the early 1930's before wooden walkways and metal swinging ladders were added. Shortly after that the 103 cement steps were poured and lights were added. It remains pretty much the same today as it was then. Visitors to the caverns will see the stalactites and stalagmites that have been forming since the last Ice Age. The cave is made up of limestone deposits. Some of the areas that visitors will see on the tour include Lost Atlantis'' which is found in a reflecting pool, twin golden domes'' that were formed from water and whirlpools and the form of an alligator can be seen along the walkway. A fire destroyed the original lodge at Secret Caverns, but a new one has taken its place. Many unique billboards will lead visitors to the entrance of Secret Caves. The bat has become the mascot of the caves and is part of the hand painted signage."

"Seneca Park Zoo","New-York","Seneca Park Zoo - Rochester, New York - small city zoo and park","The Seneca Park Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the country, dating back to 1893 as one of the parks designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmstead. Animals have been displayed at Seneca Park since 1894, when the park featured deer, birds and an open-air aviary. In 1931, the city opened the main zoo building to display exotic animals menagerie style. The animals included chimpanzees, tigers and lions. Over the years, the Seneca Park Zoo has added a polar bear grotto (in the 1970s), a nature trail (in the early 1990s) and the Rocky Coasts exhibit (1997). Today, the zoo boasts annual visitors numbering about 500,000 and includes the Kodak Discovery Center and an Animal Health and Education Complex. The animal exhibits at Seneca Park Zoo include the Polar Bear Grotto that was built in the 1970s, funded by penny and nickel collections of Rochester schoolchildren. The polar bear grotto has been refurbished in the 40 years since it was built and now includes viewing windows so that visitors can watch the polar bears swim and play in their Arctic tank. There are similar accommodations at the sea lion exhibit and the penguin exhibit, both parts of the Rocky Coasts exhibit. The Zoo's main attraction, however, is its involvement with the community. Since the early 1970s, Seneca Park Zoo has been committed to education and conservation, and their outreach shows their commitment clearly. The zoo's educational offerings go far beyond the typical school group visits, summer camps and traveling zoo exhibits to offer special classes and outreach activities for families and age-appropriate activities for parents and their children. In addition, the Seneca Park Zoo offers numerous monthly and seasonal activities for the community. Among the most popular are Family Fun nights which include dinner, beverages and hands-on activities to introduce children to animals and information about the world around us. Nearly as popular are Family Overnights, which bring families together for a dinner, late night snack and a full night of activities at the Zoo, and includes a night spent in the Rocky Coasts Gallery. The Zoo also features activities for adults. The most popular of these is the Zoo Brew, a monthly live music event held at the zoo for people age 21 and up. Each event includes live music by an area band, adult beverages and a down-home barbecue. The Seneca Zoo also offers a number of themed birthday parties for groups of children aged 3 to 12. Each birthday party package includes invitations, pizza, zoo admission and a special birthday gift for the birthday child. Themes include Creepy Crawlies, Ferocious Forest and Radical Rainforest.

"Shenendoah Golf Club at Turning Stone","New-York","Shenendoah Golf Club at Turning Stone, Verona New York? A Rick Smith-Designed Golf Course, Constructed and Maintained to PGA Tour Standards","Shenendoah Golf Club is a Rick Smith design that was constructed and is maintained to PGA Tour conditions and standards normally reserved for Tour professionals. Smith made use of the natural landscape to create a layout with wooded, parkland-style holes, simple, low country-style holes, as well as open pastures for a links feel. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays 7,129 yards from the longest (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 142 on Bent grass. Some of the most noteworthy features of Shenendoah include its generous fairways, thick woodlands, coforful fescue grasses, wetlands, and some bunkering that's been described as extraordinary. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, which plays as the most difficult on the course. This par-4 plays to 452 yards from the back tees, and a respectable 402 from the Whites. The tee shot is key here, with a wide fairway but three bunkers placed right near the landing area. From there the hole doglegs left around wetlands and approach shots must take aim at a green guarded by the hazard and a deep bunker. The most difficult hole on the back nine is No. 14, which plays to 494 yards from the tips, making this a daunting par-4. Adding to the difficulty, the fairway winds snake-like from tee to green and bunkers guard the left side of the landing area off the tee. The fairway is also narrow on the right and some thick rough will catch any wayward shots. The last three holes on the course are considered among the finest at Turning Stone, which has four other courses at the resort. At 228 yards from the tips, No. 17 is the longest par-3 on the course, but plays slightly downhill. It also features one of the smallest greens on the course, making it difficult to hit, and a well-contoured surface, including a ridge in its middle, that makes putting a challenge as well. The finishing hole is a par-5 that plays to 553 yards from the Black tees. Tee shots must carry over wetlands and sand to find a wide, but sloping, fairway. From there the hole bends to the left and second shots are forced to carry another hazard to a wide landing area. Approach shots then take aim at a green with a treacherous grass hollow in the front right, as well as a very undulating putting surface with some distinct sections. Since opening in 2000, Shenendoah has received its share of aclaim, including a ranking in the Top 100 Courses You Can Play from GOLF Magazine, and a ranking among America's 100 Greatest Public Courses from Golf Digest. The course also hosted the 2006 PGA National Club Professional Championship. Practice facilities at Shenendoah include the Golf Training Center, a premier year-round dome with state-of-the-art facilities for lessons and individual practice, including a two-tiered hitting area and two virtual golf simulators. The 28,000-square-foot clubhouse at Shenendoah is designed as a stone-and-cedar Tudor mansion and houses a Golf Shop and The Grille at Shenendoah restaurant. The Turning Stone resort also features four hotels, two spas, a total of 21 dining choices, and a world-class casino among its amentities."

The summit measures 4,200 feet above sea level (although there has never been an official measurement taken by the U.S. Coast or Geodetic Survey).

The peak was not named as the highest in the Catskills until the 19th century, but since then, the summit has had a notable history. Once the summit was named as the highest, the tourism industry shifted to this area. In addition, a woodsman began taking visitors on trips up to the summit in the late 19th century.

"Snug Harbor Cultural Center","New-York","Snug Harbor Cultural Center - Staten Island, NY - Unique Historical and Art Center","In 1801, Robert Richard Randall decided to develop a facility for aged and retired sailors. There were several legal disputes, but the facility opened in 1833 named Sailor's Snug Harbor. Originally, there was only one building, which soon expanded to three - all built in the Greek Revival style of architecture. Nearing the 1900s, the complex had over 50 buildings on its 83 acres of land. The buildings included a dairy, bakery, a self-sustaining farm, and a hospital. During this time, roughly 1,000 retired seamen inhabited the complex. The goal of the center is to preserve maritime history and to encourage the arts. This mission is accomplished by fostering a strong sense of community among the heritage of the area. In 1972, several of the old Greek Revival buildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places. One of the best ways to experience the complex, now called the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, is by taking the guided tour. The tours are run Monday - Saturday from 11am - 3:30pm during the summertime. These guided tours require reservations and a minimum of 15 guests. Reservation includes a 50% deposit. Interested parties can contact 718-425-3556 for more information. Snug Harbor offers a variety of education programs for youth. These include horticulture, performing arts, history, and visual arts. These classes require reservation as there is a 25 student capacity per class. The classes begin at 10am. There is a minimum $125 reservation. The architecture classes are designed for several age groups. Younger students will be interested in the scavenger hunt, which allows students to discover styles and items ranging from obelisks to frescos. Older students will investigate the 28 different buildings that represent Greek Revival, Beaux Arts, Second Empire and Italianate architectural styles. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art is the center for visual arts. It was first opened in 1977. Every month the Newhouse Center presents events and exhibits in its 15,000square foot galleries. In February of 2010 the center is holding the Legacy of Lincoln exhibition. This will highlight the Lincoln's presidency through political cartoons, lectures, the president's speeches, and screenings of films on Lincoln. Past exhibits have included exhibitions on the Feminist Art movement, Coney Island sideshow banner art, and more. The Center has also begun a program in concert with the Italian government which will allow the Center to loan antiquities dating from Pompeii to the Renaissance, as well as Baroque art from the Uffizi (an art gallery located in Florence, Italy). Another of the exhibits is the John A. Noble Maritime Collection. Noble and his son created a large collection of paintings, portraits, and sketches within a houseboat that they converted into a studio. The collection holds pieces that highlight maritime and shoreline culture. In 1977, the Center founded its Botanical Gardens. The Center now cultivates several gardens that represent a variety of historical periods and styles. On the first weekend in May, the Gardens hold their annual plant sale, as well as the orchid show.

There is also a life guarded swimming area and beach on the lake during the summer. Located on the shores of the lake is the red house that the lake was named for.

Those who have negative things to say about trips to the park call it condo camping,'' apparently because there are so many cabins. They also complain that you can hear people in the area at night because campers are not separated enough. Some claim the Creek is less than desirable, although they may depend on uncontrollable drought conditions. Most people agree that if it is camping privacy you are after, this is not your best option. However, if you will be camping with your family or with a large group of friends or a social organization, this would be the spot for you. Most people also agree you will fare better with less equipment since the sites are small. The nearby town of Salamanca features some fun things to do including a casino, antique shops, clothing stores, and several restaurants. If you are camping and you decide to wander into town, you could pass an afternoon or so walking around and enjoying the sights and sounds. If you love gambling, it may turn into more than just an afternoon or so!

It is a history museum that looks through the variety of toys, how play has evolved, and what it is today. Children, families, adults, students, scholars, collectors, and educators can all find something in the Strong Museum to capture their interests. Science devotes many hours to exploring cultures, history of cultures, and even how animals play. It is not surprising that a group of people have decided to study the animal that is most prevalent in the world- the Human. As humans our minds work much differently and yet the same as other animals. We have instincts, and yet can be very adaptable. The museum strives to show us this in play. Margaret Woodbury Strong was a collector of dolls and toys, among other things. She founded the museum in 1968 to show her collection, and at her death left her estate to the state. 14 years later the museum was placed in a 156,000 square foot building on 13 acres of Rochester land. In the 90's the museum progressed even further with a carousel and 1950's diner. In 2002 the museum accepted the National Toy Hall of Fame, and since then it has become one of the largest children's and history museum. On site are two museum shops, a food court, three restaurants, and numerous collections. One can spend the entire day in the Strong Museum. Museum hours are Monday through Thursday 10am to 5pm, Friday and Saturday 10am to 8pm, and Sunday 12pm to 5pm. There is also a butterfly garden at the museum which is open 11am to 5pm, 11am to 7pm, and 12pm to 5pm respectively. The museum does take toy donations to help the world, so on a visit one might bring a favored toy. General Admission is for the museum, and not the Butterfly Garden. Adults are $11 per person, Seniors $10, and Children (2 to 15) $9. For the Butterfly Garden an additional $3 is added to the museum admission. Members must pay $1.50 for the garden. There are Matinee admission prices which are from 3pm to 5pm Monday through Thursday. The Strong Museum is broken into different sections. Reading Adventureland is all about life size popup books with children's favorite stories. One can walk through the exhibit reading the books and experiencing them. A super kids market is a supermarket for children where they can learn to count, buy food, and eat healthy. Sesame Street even has a museum location. This exhibit is interactive where one can become part of Sesame Street by walking along the famous neighborhood. National Toy Hall of Fame, Field of Play, the Berenstain Bears, Carousel, Strong Express Train, and other exhibits exist at the Strong Museum. There are journeys, play times, and much more to explore and have fun. Adults will be able to step back in time and become children again."

Today it is a well established residential neighborhood on the lower west side of Manhattan. The name is an abbreviation for Triangle Below Canal'' Street, While some streets are lined with stone and brick houses built for residency, most of the buildings were warehouses and factories initially (with Romanesque style architecture). These buildings were for the most part converted into spacious loft spaces in the late 1970's and 1980's. While these buildings were low priced bargains for buyers in the early 1970's, today, renting a 1 bedroom or studio apartment costs a minimum of $2,000 per month. Recently Forbes Magazine rated this neighborhood as one of the most expensive zip codes in which to live in the U.S. Tribeca is located just south west of China Town and north of the Wall Street area of lower Manhattan. To the Southeast lies City Hall, Borough Hall and other government buildings. The neighborhood borders to the west on the Hudson River where one can stroll in the Hudson River Park. Right at the park are also found Pier 25 and 26, which are homes to a putting green, snack bar, trapeze school, a boat house and numerous other activities. These restored city piers are also docking points for several boats that are often chartered for floating concerts and dance parties around the island. At least 100 artists have their studios in Tribeca neighborhood, New York City, An artist studio walking tour is one of several walking tours available in the neighborhood. This part of town is also known for low cost alternative music events and occasionally, poetry events. Prior to mid-September of 2001, this area was literally situated in the shadows of the Twin Towers. In the wake of 9/11, there were rumors of an exodus from the area and much of lower Manhattan by residents. Though this flight never occurred there was a drop in tourism and business in the ensuing months. In an attempt to raise spirits and regenerate business in the area, actor Robert DeNiro, was among those that launched the Tribeca Film Festival. The festival has become an annual event in the spring. DeNiro is the proprietor of the Tribeca Grill, located near the Franklin Street station on the Seventh Avenue Subway the 1/9 train.

"USS Slater","New-York","USS Slater - Albany, NY - Only DE Still Afloat","The USS Slater is a World War II US Navy ship that is currently docked in Albany, NY. During the summertime, the ship is docked near the Dunn Memorial Bridge. The USS Slater DE 766 is destroyer escort ship commissioned in May of 1944. The Slater is one of 86 Cannon Class destroyer escorts that were built. The destroyer escort ships served as escort ships during WWII. Their capabilities were anti-submarine and they were sometimes referred to as DET - for their diesel electric drive propulsion engines. The USS Slater was named after Frank O. Slater, a sailor who was killed at his station on the USS San Francisco during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. After his death on November 12, 1942, Slater was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, which is the highest medal awarded by the US Navy. Fourteen members of Frank Slater's family attended the commissioning of the destroyer escort ship that was named in his honor. The ship served as a training ship and escort ship in both the Atlantic and Pacific theatres. The first task of the Slater, after her initial shakedown cruise, was to transport a torpedo taken from the German U-505 submarine to Maryland. Its next mission was serving as a target ship in Florida. Target ships allowed Navy pilots to practice attacks. Then the Slater made several trips as convoy escort from New York to England. In August of 1945, the Slater made several trips as escort through the Manila and Philippine Islands. In November, the Slater crossed the Equator. In 1947, the Slater was decommissioned. In 1951, the Slater was transferred to the Greek Navy and was renamed the Aetos. Under the Greek Flag the Aetos served as a training ship and a patrol ship in the Aegean seas. The Aetos was decommissioned in 1991, and the Greek Navy donated the ship to the Destroyer Escort Sailors Association and was towed to New York in 1993. Originally, the Slater had a 1,200 ton displacement and was crewed by 186 sailors. Its top speed was 21 knots and it wielded three torpedo tubes and ten single 20mm guns. Before its service in the Pacific theatre, the torpedo tubes were removed and replaced with twin 20mm guns. Among the current armaments are three 50cal guns, three twin 40mm guns, and nine twin 20mm guns. The Slater is the only destroyer escort ship still afloat. Tours are available during the summertime, Wednesdays through Sundays from 10am to 4pm. The ship is considered a museum in progress and is undergoing restoration efforts. Work crews and reconstruction efforts can be seen during the tour. Admission for those over 14 years of age is $7. Children ages 7-14 are $5. Senior citizens' admission is $6. Group rates are available. Tours are about an hour long. To book a tour, interested parties should call 518-431-1943. Class field trips are welcome with prior reservation. Such trips should be scheduled at least one week in advance. The goal of the restoration effort is to return the Slater to its original WWII specifications. As such, the Destroyer Escort Historical Museum requests the equipment and expertise from people with those items and skills. For people wishing to hold a reunion, the Museum requests that reservations be made. Reunion admission is $6. The Museum provides a color guard, sound system, and a tolling of the ship's bell. Currently, there are 7 reunions scheduled for the 2010 year."

"War Memorial at OnCenter","New-York","War Memorial at OnCenter, Syracuse, New York","During the 1940's and 1950's there were some hard times in the United States. To honor fellows lost in war Syracuse, New York decided to create a much needed arena and call it the Onodaga War Memorial. The facility officially opened in 1951 with Onodaga County owning and operating it. Eventually the facility was renamed the War Memorial at OnCenter. The arena is slated for multipurpose meaning that it has more than just sports games to entertain. The facility only has 6,230 seats, unless there is a floor event which can seat up to 8,000 people. The memorial arena is home to the Syracuse Crunch Ice Hockey Team. The NBA Syracuse Nationals and a few AHL teams used to call the facility home. These teams have either folded or moved to other locations. Since the arena is rather small some teams no longer fit in the arena. Kiss is one of the more popular shows to come through the arena. They have appeared at the 50's stadium in each decade. The facility also hosted NBA All Star Games, NCAA Frozen Four, and the WWF with Monday Night Raw. Some renovations were done in 1994 to update the facility. The region the facility is based in is close to the Syracuse Convention Center and Civic Center Theaters. Depending on the type of event you may have to visit one of these places. The convention center is the newest building, while the theater was built around the same time as the arena. The War Memorial Arena has three levels. The shape of the interior is almost egg shaped, except for the entrance being on one site. This is one reason why the number of seats is less than other newer locales. The upper level is only in one section of the arena instead of being all around. Events at the arena have or will include Syracuse I Day, Latino Upstate Summit, Syracuse Crunch versus Binghampton, The Dead, Syracuse Invitational Sporthorse Tournament, Syracuse Symphony Orchestra, The Derek Trucks Band, and The Rat Pack is Back. Parking at the facility is possible with the 1,000 car parking garage. There is an enclosed walkway to use in order to get to the convention center, arena, and theater. The garage is on South State Street and Adams Street for those who will be attending an event. The War Memorial at OnCenter provides a few concessions. They will offer your typical event food such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, sandwiches, and popcorn. In fact all the New York favorites can be found at the concessions. Beverage options are just as plentiful with beer, soda, bottled water, and much more. Like most arenas after September 11, 2001 the arena has come up with new code of conduct rules. Anyone attending an event in the three facilities is unable to bring their own food or drink. All backpacks or large bags will be searched and may be held until after the event.

The Tulip Festival has been held for over 60 years. The park is part of the Washington Park Historic District. In 1972, the Washington Park Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The land that the park is on was originally given by the Crown to the city of Albany in colonial times. Prior to its current use as a park, the area had been used as a cemetery, a parade ground, a welfare farm, and a public square. Work began on turning the area into a park shortly after the Civil War. The pattern of the park comes from Frederick Law Olmsted's designs. Olmsted is the individual that designed Central Park in New York and Mont Royal Park in Montreal. Washington Park is landscaped in the Victorian tradition and is a combination of gardens and landscaped lawn. Washington Park is home to approximately 100 species of trees, and the area resembles a botanical garden in many ways.

Sullivan, and gas lamps were originally used to light the footbridge until 1881, which is when they were converted to electric lights. The foot bridge is made of stone. The lake is stocked with fish in the summer, so it is a popular fishing destination. In the winter, ice skating is permitted on the lake. The park is also home to the Lakehouse.

"Where Sculpture and Nature Meet","New-York","Where Sculpture and Nature Meet","This outdoor sculpture display features 500 acres of lawn, woodlands, and field. Instead of museum walls and doors, this space is defined by the natural surroundings of the sky and the ground. The grounds, which include the rolling hills of the Hudson Highlands, make for a dramatic and appropriate backdrop to this modern sculpture collection. Both the natural light and the weather have an effect on the art and no matter where you look, with each passing moment and subsequent visits, the exhibits are different. This is because nature interacts with the sculptures, creating a new work of art from moment to moment. The display is an effort to encourage people to enjoy both art and nature, and to spend time moving through the countryside exploring the art. There have been recent expansions in the park including a new wooded grove, the North Trail, and the restoration of several walking paths leading through the park and to and around the art. Important to the Storm King Community is creative farming. The 500 acres around the sculptures were part of a farming community for more than 200 years. During the latter part of the 20th century the Hudson Valley became harder to sustain. In 1997 there was a program created to reintroduce native wildflowers and grasses into the fields of the 500 acres. So far the endeavor is going well and growing in the area is buckwheat, oats, and alfalfa. Walking through the sculpture center now means strolling among these native grasses that are in full bloom. During the winter months the center is closed. It typically opens in early April and is open Wednesday through Sunday from 10 am until 5:30 pm. There are Saturday evening hours and the center remains open until 8 pm. Admission is $8 to $10 and there is a discount offered for seniors and children. Visits usually last several hours and involve a lot of walking, although it is not strenuous. Visitors are welcome to bring picnics with them and eat and drink on the premises. There are tables available in designated picnic areas. You can also dine at Woody's Cafy at Storm King. The feature drinks, snacks, and light lunch items. Tours of Storm King are available and they highlight the collection of sculpture. Led by docents, this walking tour is great for individuals who would like to learn more about the collection. Tours typically last about an hour. Tram tours are also available and they run throughout the day beginning at 11 am. These tours meet at the elevator and are free with your cost of admission. The Acoustiguide tours allow you to self-guide a tour led by audio narrated by the Chairman, Director and Curator of Storm King. The cost of this tour is $4 for members and $5 for non-members. Group tours are available and feature discounted admission for groups of 15 or more people. These group tours are docent led.
