"Boot Hill Museum","Kansas","Boot Hill Museum, Dodge City, Kansas","To preserve the history of Dodge City, a museum was founded. The Boot Hill Museum was opened in 1947. There are seven exhibits at the museum based on the old west. Boot Hill is part of Front Street. Along Front Street are old west style buildings, which are part of the museum. There is a city Drug Store, Saloon, General Outfitting Store, and much more. Each year they have a Chuck Wagon Dinner during summer, Gunfighters, and a variety show. Long Branch Saloon was purchased in 1878 by Chakley Beeson and William Harris. The original building was destroyed in a fire in 1885. The building that is part of the museum today replaced the original. Historic photographs were used to ensure the replica would be similar. A two piece bar sits inside which was built in 1881 by the Brunswick Corporation. It is made of cherry wood. At the back of the bar sit two Golden Eagles which belonged to Chakley. These eagles are stuffed and both are 100 years old. The law states it is illegal for anyone to own eagles unless they are Native American or a museum that acquired them before the 1940's. So that makes these two rather unique. Another exhibit at the Boot Hill Museum is the Nomadic Indians display. The display examines the lives of these Native Americans. The nomads moved with the buffalo herds because they used the meat and the skin. The skin was used for clothing, tipis, and saddles. Sometimes they even made other items out of the skin. The clothing at the museum is reproduced with accurate beading and even medicine bags. As mentioned the buffalo were important to the Native American way of life for some tribes. The buffalo has had a difficult past. There was a near destruction of the species with over hunting, especially by those who would not use the entire buffalo. Information regarding the history of the buffalo, artifacts, and even the hide are on display. A prairie dog and rattle snake are also in this part of the museum. Guns that Won the West is an exhibit about the different guns used in the Old West. Rifles, flints, and pistols are all part of the display. Much of the collection has been donated, even a rare Winchester advertisement that is in perfect condition. The Gambler is an important person of the Old West History. Guns, derringers, and pocket pistols make up the collection of the Gambler. The museum was actually built on the site for the Boot Hill Cemetery. When Dodge City expanded it is believed the cemetery was moved, though it was only open for six years. Jack Reynolds, JM Essington, Charles Hill, and Ed Williams were said to be buried in the cemetery. In 1874 a Union Church was built. At the museum is a replica of the First Union Church. Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson were deacons of the church. At the time the church was built it cost $1000."

It is called Never Too Big'' depicting a mother holding a child. Shakespearean Garden offers a replica of a William Shakespeare bust, and Italian sculpture made with Carrara marble. The sculpture is a representation of the four seasons. Flowers and herbs in this section have all been mentioned by Shakespeare in his work. To add to the beauty of the garden is a fountain with 120 hand carved stones. Native and migratory butterflies can be found in the Butterfly Garden. They come for the fountain of water and the flowering plants. A sculpture of a young boy with a small girl holding butterflies is appropriately positioned. Benches are spread throughout the display for visitors to relax and watch the butterflies. Roses can be seen at the Jessie Wooldridge Brosius Garden. Over 350 rose plants are found in this area. Even species of roses that might not be found in nature have been created and planted at the rose garden. Walking through Botanica visitors will come upon the Woodland Walk. It is a natural area with birds, foxes, and other animals. Hackberry, elm, mulberry, redbuds, honeylocust, and osage orange fill the natural woodland attracting the wildlife for visitors. No garden is complete without a terraced area. Garden on the Rocks is located to the west of Martha Parriott Terrace Garden where sedum and sempervivum live.

"Brown vs. Board of Education National Historic Site","Kansas","Brown vs. Board of Education National Historic Site, Topeka, Kansas","The story of Brown vs. the Board of Education is perhaps one of the most well known and important aspects of American history. It was the start of the end of segregation in public schools. Those involved with the case such as the teachers, students, secretaries, and others may not have understood how much they would change things when they asked to be treated equally. It may have taken years for behavior to change regarding segregation, but at least the case made it clear that segregation was illegal. Brown vs. the Board of Education National Historic Site is the site where history was forever changed regarding the segregation of the school system. The site is located on 17th street. The museum is open daily from 9am to 5pm, though it is closed on major holidays. Hours can vary for special events. Admission to the site is free; however, a donation is quite welcome.

"Castle Rock","Kansas","Castle Rock, Quinter, KS","People traveling along I-70 through Kansas will come upon an unassuming town called Quinter, Kansas. The town doesn't have a lot of residents, but it did achieve some notoriety in 2006 when one of those residents was declared the oldest worker in the United States at age 104. His name was Waldo McBurney. Another feature that the town has to share is the Castle Rock and Badlands area south of the city. Quinter, Kansas is in the western part of the state. The badlands area features fossils, limestone, sandstone, chalk and geological formations. Castle Rock is considered to be one of the eight wonders of Kansas. The Castle Rock formation is roughly twelve miles south of Interstate 70 between the towns of Quinter and Collyer. Castle Rock is made up of chalk, limestone and shale. This formation is on private land, so the road to it is not maintained by the state. Portions of the road are rugged with some eighteen inch deep ruts to maneuver around once people leave the dirt road. Cars can make the trip, but SUV's or trucks will have better clearance. The Castle Rock formation is very fragile and in 2001 there was a thunderstorm that toppled the tallest spire. People are afraid that the Castle Rock spires may not last a lot longer. The badlands are a bit further south of the Castle Rock spires. Visitors to the Kansas badlands will probably feel quite alone. They are totally undeveloped so they are as nature produced them. The badlands rise up out of the prairie surrounded by cattle and not much else. The lower portions are light colored and form layers of other colored rock until the top is reached with their black tops. Visitors wishing to get to Castle Rock from the west should take exit 107 off of I-70 at Quinter. Then visitors need to turn south on Castle Rock Road for about fifteen miles. Vehicles then turn east at County Road 466 and follow the signs. If visitors are coming from the east they will take exit 115 at Collyer, then go south on Banner Road for about twelve and half miles. Once they get to County Road 466 or Castle Rock Road they must watch for the sign on the right. The roads to Castle Rock get very muddy in wet weather. Castle Rock was used in the past as a landmark. The Butterfield Overland Dispatch used the Smoky Hill Trail which is a bit north of the spires. Ruts from the trail can still be seen a few hundred yards north of the Castle Rock spires. The formations got their name from Lt. Julian Fitch who was a surveyor for the Butterfield Overland Dispatch. Fossils from the ancient Cretaceous Sea period are on the private land. Visitors with a keen eye may spot a shark's tooth now and then, although they must be left in place. There are several hotels in the Quinter area such as the Budget Host Q Motel and the Q Inn. Food sources include the Q Inn Restaurant, Dairy Queen and the Pizza Station."

"Colbert Hills Golf Course","Kansas","Colbert Hills Golf Course, Manhattan, Kansas - Often Referred to as ``That Really Big Golf Course Out In Kansas''","Since opening in 2000, Colbert Hills Golf Course has acquired a reputation as that really big [golf] course out in Kansas.'' It has also acquired a reputation as being one of the toughest golf courses in the country. The course is the brainchild and dream of a Kansas State alumnus and PGA Tour player, Jim Colbert, who envisioned a place were the Kansas State golf team could train, and where the school could also train golf course managers and superintendents to do research on turfgrass. Colbert also envisioned the course as a public, daily-fee course, as well as a place where disadvantaged children could learn the game. Colbert worked with golf course architect Jeffrey Brauer to design and build the big, sprawling layout that runs through 300 acres of land atop the Flint Hills at at the northwest edge of Manhattan, Kansas. According to Colbert, God built about 14 of the holes, and we built about four of them.'' Perhaps the most surprising feature of the course are its elevation changes. To golfers not familiar with the area, they would probably expect the typically flat Kansas topography. But Colbert Hills is hilly and some holes have elevation changes of 100 feet. Adding to the challenge is the length, which reaches a stunning 7,525 yards from the Black and Blue tees to go with a USGA rating of 77.5 and a slope rating of 152. With those numbers, the course has been said to be Tiger-proof.'' There are seven sets of tees in all, however, making the course manageable for golfers of all levels. The 18-hole, par-72 course employs a traditional, Scottish links-style design, and golfers should never expect to find themselves behind a tree, but they will find more than 100 sand bunkers. The course is constructed with mounds along its sides, and holes wind up and down through valleys. If viewed from above, the holes tend to be laid out end-to-end like a large figure-eight, which means just about every hole is isolated from the rest. All the tees are elevated and provide some stunning views of the surrounding area. From the tee on Hole No. 7, in particular, golfers should be able to see for miles in every direction. The first hole is also particularly noteworthy, setting the tone as one of the most challenging on the course. This par-5 plays to 590 yards from the back tees and has the added challenge of a fairway split right and left by a large pond. The tee shot is downhill from a dramatically elevated tee box, but the second shot calls for a decision: continue playing the right fairway or cross the water if necessary to the left fairway which runs up to the green. Another noteworthy hole is the par-4 No. 13, said to be the favorite of the course general manager. The scenic hole plays to only 316 yards from the Purple tees, but features an initial carry over a shallow ravine to a narrow fairway, then an approach shot to a slightly elevated green surrounded by some penalizing bunkers. The practice facilities at Colbert Hills are said to be second-to-none,'' and include a 10-acre, all-grass practice area. The driving range can accommodate up to 90 golfers and features elevated practice tees on nine different decks. The range target greens are cut into hills, providing players the opportunity to play some interesting shots. The facility also features three putting greens and two pitching and chipping greens along with two sand bunkers. Colbert Hills also features a pro shop and lessons are available in a variety of options."

On display are arrowheads, pottery, and a 5,000 year old human effigy head. A replica of a grass lodge and war lance is also available to see. The war lance dates to the 1860's. The cultures displayed at the museum include the Osage, Wichita, and Kansa. These tribes used the plains for their homes for many centuries. The Oregon and Santa Fe Trails were imperative to going westward or southward. To symbolize this The Forts and Trails exhibit has a prairie scene with buffalo and dogs. There is also a rifle once used by a trader. Other trails existed going from Kansas. For example the Oregon- California Trail began at the Missouri River to go northeast through Kansas. The history of the more important trails is discussed in the exhibit. When people think about the civil war they tend to think only of the eastern states like Virginia and Georgia that were involved. However, the war also affected places like Kansas. Part of the exhibit is the pike John Brown purchased in order to arm slaves. A camp scene with a stove, camp chair, and lamp desk also make up the collection. Kansas soldiers used weapons and had uniforms which are now on display at the museum. Lastly in this section is a painting of the Battle of the Blue. To help visitors imagine the past a log house was built inside the museum depicting life along the Saline River. A stage coach from the Southwestern Stage Company, 1930's Farmall tractor and Queen'' windmill are on display. After the Civil War settlers were lured out to Kansas and other areas with a promise of cheap land. Many of the settlers were farmers. The museum shows this lifestyle of the agricultural set as well.

"Kansas State Capitol Building","Kansas","Kansas State Capitol Building, Topeka, Kansas","Take a step back in history by visiting the Kansas State Capitol Building in Topeka, Kansas. The building is located downtown on twenty acres. C.K. Holliday donated the land in 1862 for Capitol Square. It was decided the building should have a French renaissance architecture with Corinthian details. Due to construction issues the state capitol building took three years to build. In the winter of 1867 the cornerstone foundation crumbled, so limestone had to be brought in. In 1869 the state offices were finally transferred to the Kansas State Capitol Building. Over the next thirty- seven years more construction continued on the building to make it what it is now. By the end of the construction the cost was over $3,000,000.00. Details of the building are as follows: from north to south the building is 399 feet, and 386 feet from east to west. To the top of the cupola the height is 304 feet. The dome is 66 feet in diameter at the bottom of the copper dome and 54 feet at the top. The cupola height is approximately 23 feet. Visitors will be able to see a number of interesting pieces of art during the tour of the capitol building. John Stuart Curry painted murals on the walls, around the dome, and in other places in the building. These murals are still there for the public. What visitors will see includes the dome, which has windows at the very top of the copper structure. The structure was approved in 1881, and construction was complete by 1885. To reach the dome there are 296 steps. There is no elevator. It is possible to tour the dome, with a view of Topeka out the windows. A very large curved staircase will bring visitors around to the top of the dome. Mentioned previously were the Curry Murals. The murals are in the east and west wings of the second floor. One of the murals depicts the anti slavery movement in the Kansas Territory before the Civil War. The painting shows John Brown who was killed for his beliefs. In fact Brown was hung for treason in 1859 for leading a raid on a federal arsenal in Harper's Ferry, Virginia. Another of the famed murals is the Conquistadors, with Coronado and Spanish explorers of 1541 depicted. Father Padilla, one of the first Christian martyrs of the United States is also shown. Outside the capitol building is Ad Astra, a Kansas Warrior bronze sculpture. It was placed on the top of the dome in 2002, adding 22 feet to the overall building. The statue weighs 4,420 pounds. The sculpture faces the North Star with a bow and arrow in the warrior's hands. To visit the Kansas State Capitol one can go Monday thru Friday from 9am to 4pm. There are tours of the building every hour, with the last starting at 3pm. Admission is $5 for adults and $3 for children. Under five years of age are allowed in for free."
"Kansas Underground Salt Museum","Kansas","Kansas Underground Salt Museum, Hutchinson, Kansas","One of Kansas's eight wonders is the Kansas Underground Salt Museum in Hutchinson. In 1887 drilling for natural gas began, but the drillers didn't encounter the gas that was found years later. Instead they found a bed of salt shale at 300 and 350 feet. Some of the salt shale even went as far as 600 feet into the earth. By 1888 a salt mine was being erected in order to pull out the valuable resource. The caverns left from the excavation now make up the tourist locale of the Salt Museum. Visitors to the museum are taken on a ride through the tunnels into the 650 foot depths to learn about the mining process, the salt, and geological information. Museum hours for summer are Tuesday through Saturday 9am to 6pm and Sunday 1pm to 6pm. The museum is closed on Mondays. The Visitors Center closes an hour before the mines. Tours of the underground world last for one and a half hours to two hours. Admission prices for adults are $14.35 and children are $9.05. Children under four are not allowed into the mine due to mine safety regulations. It is best to make reservations before arriving at the Kansas Underground Salt Museum. Groups are welcome with advanced reservations. The latest addition to the salt mine museum is the GE Engine No. 2. It is one of three engines ever built. It is on display outside of the museum. The engine was built in 1919 and operated from 1928 to 1963 on a short railway line. It provided switching services for the Carey Evaporation Plant and Salt Mine. The rail was less than six miles long, but it helped the Carey Salt Mine stay successful. The Champlin Oil Refinery, Detroiter Mobile Homes, and the Kelly Mills Companies also used the engine. It weighs 60,000 pounds and has a horse power of 260 with an overhead electric line. The engine had to be repaired a few times due to crashes. To restore the engine for the museum new doors and windows had to be added. Another exhibit of the salt mines is organisms found by scientists. Dr. Russell Vreeland, Dr. William Rosenzweig, and Dr. Dennis Powers found living bacteria trapped inside a salt crystal. These organisms are created with living during the time before dinosaurs. The salt crystals were not found at Hutchinson's mine, but they are on display at the museum. The find has increased attention in Hutchison for scientists as they now struggle to find bacteria in the mine. If they do find these bacteria they will be older than those already found and on display. A special event at the Underground Salt Mine is the Murder in the Mine dinner theater. A murder has occurred on the Disoriented Express'' and the best criminals have been brought in for the job. Sherlock Homes, Charlie Chan, and others are on hand to help solve the mystery for visitors attending the theater. The museum also hosts a Halloween extravaganza complete with costume contest."
"Lee Richardson Zoo","Kansas","Lee Richardson Zoo - Garden City, Kansas - small Kansas zoo with around 300 animals","In 1919, George Finnup donated over 100 acres of land to build a park in memory of his father. Finnup Park became a zoo less than a decade later when the Chief of Police and Park and Zoo Superintendent, Lee Richardson, brought in a pair of skunks. The local chapter of the Izaak Walton League challenged each member to find at least one animal to help get the zoo off the ground, and the best was a gift of an African lion, which was purchased from a traveling circus. It was officially named in honor of Lee Richardson in 1950, and he died the next year. Opened in 2005, the zoo's newest exhibit is called Kansas Waters and celebrates the freshwater life in this state. Visitors can enjoy and up-close experience watching otters live and play, and an interactive learning experience helps children understand the water cycle. Other animals featured in the North American section of the park include foxes, elk, bison, and pronghorns. All of these animals live in environments that simulate what Kansas once looked like. One of the most popular exhibits at this zoo is the big cats exhibit. The donation of the lion in the early days of the zoo really solidified this park as a legitimate tourist destination. Today, they also have Siberian tigers, American mountain lions (also called pumas or cougars), jaguars, snow leopards, and bobcats. In addition, the zoo is home to a pachyderm exhibit that features two African elephants that were humanely culled from the wilds of Zimbabwe and a black rhino, also an endangered African species. Of the nearly 150 species found at the Lee Richardson Zoo, many are part of the conservation effort known as the Species Survival Plan. Started in 1981, this plan maintains animal specials that are threatened in the wild. A number of animals at this zoo, including the spider monkey, red panda, Victoria crowned pigeon, and Bali Mynah, are a part of this program, and even more animals at this zoo are part of the national Population Management Plan program, which is a similar program for animals that aren't as highly threatened. The Lee Richardson Zoo's Population Management Plan program includes the red kangaroo, reticulated giraffe, black howler monkey, bleeding heart dove, hooded crane, burrowing owl, kookaburra, trumpeter swan, and leaf-tailed gecko. The Lee Richardson Zoo, in addition to housing a number of reptiles and mammals, is also home to the Marie Osterbuhr Aviary, which includes a large flight cage and four smaller indoor exhibits. Guests can see cardinals, owls, lovebirds, storks, cranes, ducks, and many other species of birds from around the world at this aviary. Their open-air flight cage is open throughout the year, though the only birds visitors can see during the winter months are hardy species like pheasants and mynas. Other birds are protected indoors from the cold Kansas climate. The Lee Richardson Zoo is accredited by the national American Zoo and Aquarium Association. They're open seven days a week, with hours starting at 8:00 AM. Guests can choose to walk through the zoo for free, or they can drive a vehicle through for just a minimal charge. Prospective visitors can call 620-276-1250 for more information."

"Museum Dedicated to Clown","Kansas","Museum Dedicated to Clown","The Emmett Kelly Museum is located in Sedan, Kansas and is dedicated to its native son, the famous, sad-faced clown Emmett Kelly, and his character Weary Willie. The museum is located in the 1896 Opera House on Main Street. The collection includes memorabilia of his circus career as well as many items related to local history. To be honest, there are more things unrelated to Kelly housed in the museum than items attributed to the famous clown. That's not to say there aren't items that belonged to the well-known slapstick comedian, but one shouldn't expect to be overwhelmed with memorabilia on Kelly himself. In any event, admission is free and if you have affection for clowns or are interested in finding out about the history of Sedan, Kansas, it would be worth taking the time to visit. Sedan, Kansas was the birthplace of Emmett Kelly, who portrayed Weary Willie, possibly the most famous circus entertainers of all time. Emmett Leo Kelly was born on December 9, 1898. Very little evidence details the period that the Kelly's lived in Sedan, but it is known that his father, Thomas Kelly, was a section boss for the local railroad. His mother, Molly, is believed to have run a local boarding house. Kelly's family moved to Missouri from Sedan when he was still a young child. Emmett died in Sarasota, Florida on March 28, 1979. He is buried in Lafayette, Indiana. In 1967, Sedan honored the legendary performer with the opening of the Emmett Kelly Museum. As previously noted collection has a limited number of Emmett Kelly items, but does offer many snapshots, newspaper articles and clippings, circus placards and a number of items related to other, lesser known, clowns some of who worked in circuses around the same time as Kelly. Several of the prized items directly associated with Emmett are a huge pair of scuffed-up clown shoes donated to the museum along with a shirt and tie once worn by Kelly's character. Visitors can also admire The Original Emmett Kelly Circus Collection Limited Edition Figurines. The small Emmett Kelley Museum also serves as the community historical museum with the greater part of the building being devoted to the exhibits of other items donated by Sedan residents. The greatest area of the museum is comprised of a huge collection of over 1500 collector whisky bottles and decanters. Included is the largest known assembly of commemorative Jim Beam bottles. Other items archived in the small museum include Russell Wemmer's well preserved, collection of radios, televisions and phonograph players, most which still function with some dating back as far as 1925. The old opera building also has quite a nice assortment of very old printing presses from bygone years. Items once belonging to D. W. Washburn's character, Sparky can be found among the many circus and clown related objects. Washburn died the same year as Emmett Kelly. He was well known in the circus circles but evidently never worked directly with Kelly since Emmett was known for his individual performances as Weary Willy and never performed with the clown groups. With the amount of objects belonging to Sparky the Clown, some might wonder why the museum doesn't bear his name instead of Emmett's. None the less, it is quite an impressive display of clown items. The museum also has memorabilia from the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and historical quilts. The museum is open to the public from the beginning of May until the end of October."

"Old Cowtown Museum","Kansas","Old Cowtown Museum, Wichita, Kansas","Take a step back in history with the Old Cowtown Museum. The museum reflects life as it was in the 1870's. The activities, sights, and sounds at the museum will resemble real life at a Midwestern cattle town. The period of time is reflective of the Victorian era, where the old west meshes with the Victorian. Exhibits range from wagon rides, blacksmithing, to replicated homes. The Old Cowtown Museum is located in Wichita, Kansas. There are seasonal hours for the museum. From November 1st to April 24th the museum is open Tuesday thru Saturday 10am to 4pm. April 25th to October 31st the museum is open Wednesday thru Saturday 9:30am to 4:30pm, and Sunday noon to 4:30pm. Admission into the Cowtown Museum is $7.75 for adults, $6 for ages 12 to 17, and $5.50 for children under 12. Group rates will vary depending on the type of group. School groups are the least expensive. The first exhibit is called the Old West'' Cowtown. The exhibits include an accurate representation of the frontier. Furniture, structures, art, clothing, machines, and tools are all from the 1870's. The pieces in the museum were actually used to build it. Photographs, letters, and documents are also housed in the buildings to explain life in the past. Total the museum has twenty- six buildings which are historically accurate. Interpreters and actors will act out the life in the old west with gun fights and more. The Buffalo Hunter Trader exhibit explains the economic activity. Hunting and trading was the first and most important way to support life on the frontier. Men would come to the Great Plains'' to hunt and sell the animal skins. Trading posts were erected throughout the region, so the museum decided to recreate one showing the relationship between the Native Americans and frontiersmen. The Trader's Cabin was once on the Chisholm Trail in Clearwater, Kansas. Visitors are able to go into the cabin to touch the furs and read tales about the hunters. A second building as part of this exhibit is the Munger House and Garden. The Munger house was the home of Darius Sales Munger. It was used as a boarding house, church, post office, and public gathering place. The home is the original built in 1868. It was the first home in Wichita to have a shingle roof. The Business and Industrial area houses the train depot, drugstore, blacksmith, meat market, and Fritz Snitzlers Saloon. Each of these buildings has a history as part of a real town. For example the Fritz Snitzlers Saloon was a real place for eating, drinking and gambling. In fact the saloon would pay the monthly license fees to reduce the cost of taxes. The meat market was a place for wild game like buffalo, deer, antelope, and elk to be purchased. The last section of the Cowtown Museum is the Residential Street with the Murdock House and Garden, Story and Half House, and First Presbyterian Church. Marshall Murdock promoted the town through his newspaper. Today you can see gun fights erupt or take a meal with the Diamond W Wranglers."
"Overland Park Arboretum and Botanical Gardens","Kansas","Overland Park Arboretum and Botanical Gardens, Overland Park, Kansas","Conservation in Overland Park, Kansas is very important to the residents. In honor of their feelings Overland Park Arboretum and Botanical Gardens was started. They are a leader in the city for both environmental issues and community development. The arboretum is an educational, cultural, and recreational place for the Kansas City area. The park is located on 179th street, west of Antioch.

Eighty- five percent of the property at the Arboretum is dedicated to preservation and the restoration of ecosystems. The rest of the park is set up as a botanical gardens and for the Environmental Education Visitors Center. In 2006 further work was completed on Overland Park Arboretum to create thirteen new gardens and four conservatories. They also built a new visitors center. The gardens added were a rose garden, training garden, home gardens, Rill garden, and wedding green. Currently there are 300 ecologically dedicated acres with identification plates at various points discussing the area and the plants. Hiking trails take visitors through much of the land. About six miles of paved and wood chip hiking trails will take visitors through the Blue River and Wolf Creek Bisects of the park. To explore the gardens more fully, visitors have the Erickson Water Garden, Lakeside Amphitheater, Learning Arboretum, Legacy Garden, Marder Woodland Glen, Rotary Children's Discovery Garden, Monet Garden, and Xeriscape Garden. Claude Monet is one of the most famous French painters. Overland Park Arboretum decided to recreate his French gardens with special visual effects, color harmonies, and garden accents. The garden has tiers of colorful flowers with arbors and trellises. Some of the flowers fall over rock walls and along the paths. Xeriscape Gardens show how the land can be water efficient as well as pleasing. Water rushes over rock into a pool, where visitors can sit on the bridge to watch the flow of water in a greenery area. Part of the mission of the Overland Park recreation area is to help with restoration. Prairie restoration reclaims land that has been lost. In 2002 160 acres were bought by the park to begin the project. Big Bluestem, Little Bluestem, Osage Indiangrass, and Sideoats Grama are all plants that are part of the restoration. There is a plan for three year rotation of reseeding, haying, and burning which helps simulate the wildlife and buffalo grazing of the past. The Arboretum and Botanical Gardens provides a free tour. Tours can be arranged Monday through Friday, but should be scheduled three to four weeks in advance. Groups are also welcome to visit the gardens. Twelve or more individuals must be part of a group. Schools must choose a specific date for visiting to ensure the park does not become over crowded."

"Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure","Kansas","Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure - Salina, Kansas - interactive zoo and museum","The history and progression of Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure, an AZA accredited zoo located in Salina, Kansas, is quite an interesting one. In 1999, Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure opened its doors to the public with 45 species of animals, many of which were endangered and rare species. Just a year after opening, construction on a 64,000 sq. ft. Conference Center began, which opened in 2002. In 2005 came the opening of the Wildlife Museum. The Wildlife Museum is one of the most popular attractions of Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure. It is unlike most museums in the industry, as it combines visitor and nature in an interactive experience. No longer is a piece of glass separating the visitor from the exhibit - visitors are immersed into what they are seeing and experiencing which allows for a truly unique and memorable experience. Visiting the museum, guests will have the chance to learn about more than 350 species of animals, human culture, and nature from all over the world. Aside from an incredible journey of knowledge within the walls of the museum, many exhibits are complemented with robotic animatronic characters that describe each ecosystem and how plants, animals, and humans all interact within them. Not only does the museum do a wonderful job at studying things here on earth, but takes visitors into the far reaches of the universe with its ADM 3-D theatre. The film shown depicts just how unique our world is within the vastness of outer space. Though many people come to visit the Wildlife Museum for the vast education that it offers, the zoo is nothing to miss spanning graciously over 60 acres. With many species to learn about and see, the zoo at Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure only gets better each year. Visitors can come face-to-face with a wide variety of animals from across the globe including the Indian rhino, chimpanzees, rare white camels, orangutans, mandrills, and aardvarks to name a few. The animals are cared for by a highly trained group of zookeepers who are happy to answer any questions that guests may have. Each zookeeper on the crew is specially trained to maintain and enhance the quality of life of the animals in their care. The animals and zookeepers share a special relationship, so visiting with a zookeeper will enlighten visitors to the lives and personalities of each animal they see. Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure has expanded greatly from its humble beginnings ten years ago. Today, the zoo is home to more than 105 species, an incredible museum, and is expanding the number of exhibits regularly. Through its ten years, what was new landscaping when doors opened has grown and flourished into beautiful shade trees, mature shrubs, and blooming flowers for guests and animals to enjoy. In the spring or summer of 2009, the zoo will welcome its one-millionth guest. Visitors may purchase tickets for just the museum or zoo separately, but combination tickets are the best value. Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure also offers military discounts, group rates, memberships, and a picnic area for guests preferring to bring their own food.

"Sedgwick County Zoo","Kansas","Sedgwick County Zoo - Wichita, Kansas - large city zoo with over 2,500 animals representing 500 species","The Sedgwick County Zoo is the largest zoo in Kansas, a collection of over 2,500 animals from 500 different species. The zoo opened in 1971 after an eight-year effort of fund-raising and lobbying by the Sedgwick County Zoological Association. In the first year, the Sedgwick County Zoo featured just two exhibit areas, the Asian and the American farm exhibits. In the years since, the zoo has expanded steadily, opening a new major exhibit every few years. The most recent new offerings at the zoo are the Cessna Penguin Cove, opened in 2007, and the Plaza Beastro, a food court opened in 2008. Another new exhibit, the Slawson Family Tiger Trek, opened May 22, 2009. The Slawson Tiger Trek is more than a tiger exhibit, though. The trek is designed as a completely immersive experience for visitors, and is home to not only two kinds of tigers but also red pandas, tapirs, cranes and storks and Asian deer. It is a world-class state-of-the-art facility, and it is the only one of its kind located in Kansas. Other exhibits include animal environments focusing on animals that are native to North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Around the outskirts of the main continental exhibit areas, visitors can take a trek through the Jungle House to meet over 60 species of birds native to the rain forests, visit the lions or make their way through a bat cave. Further along the path, zoo guests can wander through the reptile house and meet Komodo dragons, Chinese alligators and other fascinating reptiles and amphibians. The Sedgwick County Zoo has the distinction of being one of only two zoos in the world that has documented the ability of Komodo dragons to breed through parthenogenesis. The original exhibits at the zoo were the American and the Asian farms. Those two farm exhibits are still an important part of the Sedgwick Zoo, along with a third farm, the African Farm, added in 1990. The farms feature domestic animals and are billed as the Children's Farms'', but they are more than just petting zoos. Each of the farms is home to many rare and endangered heirloom species of domesticated animals. Each animal on each farm was chosen because it was developed specifically in that region or played a large part in the history of the area. The Sedgwick County Zoo is actively engaged in education and conservation efforts. In addition to traveling zoo outreach, the Sedgwick Zoo offers Zoo Trunks'' which feature interactive lessons and animal artifacts that can be rented by classroom teachers and homeschool families for as little as $5. The Zoo also offers special activities for groups and families that include nocturnal visits and overnight campouts for kids and families. The Sedgwick County Zoo is open 364 days a year, closing only for the annual Zoobilee fundraiser. Hours are seasonal. Admission ranges from $6.50 to $11, with discounts available for groups.

"Seelye Mansion","Kansas","Seelye Mansion, Abilene, Kansas","Historically Kansas has a long past, first with the Native Americans and then with frontiersman. Some of Kansas is just open fields, where the towns are few and far between. Other places like Abilene, Kansas offer a great deal to their residents and visitors. Abilene began as a stage coach stop in 1857 by Timothy Hersey. Eventually a railroad was positioned to go through the town. This brought the attention of Dr. and Mrs. A.B. Seelye. The couple wanted to have a home built in Abilene that could be called the finest home. They hired an architect from New York to create a Georgian style mansion. At time of construction the home cost $55,000. It was completed in 1905. The Seelye Mansion is open for tours Monday through Saturday starting at 10am and on Sunday from 1pm. The house and grounds close at 6pm each day. Seelye Mansion is closed on Christmas. Admission into the house is $10 for adults, $7.50 for groups of ten or more, $5 for children 6 to 12, and youth groups are $5. Before the mansion was opened for tour the society that owns it made sure the original furniture and Edison light fixtures would be on display. The house has twenty- five rooms which includes eleven bedrooms, a ballroom bowling alley, and kitchen areas. Some of the rooms are of special interest. There is a dining room and music room. The music room has gold French furniture and a Steinway Grand Piano. There is also a library on the premises. In the grand hall is a Tiffany designed fireplace. As part of the tour of the house, visitors can tour the Patent Medicine Museum. This museum has many artifacts belonging to the A.B. Seelye Medical Company. The medical company was founded in 1890 and more than a hundred products were sold in a fourteen state area. Medicine bought at the time was Wasa- Tusa, Fro-zona, and Ner-vena. Also on the grounds at the Seelye Mansion are the gardens. The gardens did not survive time, but those who own the house restored the patio and fish pond, as well as the gardens to the 1905 landscape. There was a drawing left from the past that helped the restoration project. Each tour includes the mansion, gardens, and museum with tour guide. When Mrs. Seelye was alive they hosted Christmas parties at the house. She would decorate the entire home with trees, poinsettias, and many beautiful decorations. Today from December 1st to January 1st the Seelye Mansion is decorated as it was in the past. Visitors to the area and residents are able to take the special Christmas tours. The admission fee remains the same all year long. However, during the Christmas tour refreshments are served in honor of the holiday. Architecturally speaking the home is symmetrical with the porches, size of the rooms, and the front entry columns.

"Subterra Castle","Kansas","Subterra Castle, Dover, KS","Dover, Kansas has quite a rich history since it was founded in 1860. There are several commercial buildings that are still standing where K-4 and 57th Street intersect. There is a large Girl Scout Camp about two miles south of the town. Echo Cliff is a fifty foot high cliff that is just west of the town. Settlers from Britain were the first people to live in Dover. The city was once very prosperous as it was on the path of the Southwest Trail. This was used as a connection point for people using the Oregon Trail through Topeka to get to the Santa Fe Trail. Mission Creek which ran along the trail could only be crossed in two places and one of them was Dover. An inn was built by the Sage Family to provide food, a place to change horses or even spend the night. The location was at the halfway point between the trails. While the city was at its peak they had a business that produced wagons, a factory that made matches, a couple of grist mills, a Stage Coach Station, blacksmiths, a livery stable, and a General Store. It was also home to three cheese factories. Two of these factories produced a lot of the cheese in the United States. Visitors that come to the area can see the 1878 stone Sage Inn & Stage Coach Station, the General Store and the Subterra Castle. The Subterra used to house an Atlas E intercontinental ballistic missile with a 4 megaton warhead. It was stored in the underground cave that is now the Subterra Castle. This site has been featured on many television shows around the world. Thirty four acres are part of the estate that now belongs to Edward and Dianna Peden. They have lived in the underground property since 1994. Tours and special events are part of the fun of the Subterra Castle. The exterior of the Subterra Castle contains a half mile of paved driveway and a security fence around the central area. There is a three room cabin with utilities that measures 450 square feet. Two observation towers are on the premises and a one acre stocked pond complete with a dock and sand beach. Another rustic cabin, a ceremonial stone circle, fire pit, RV hook up, wood fired outdoor sauna, gardens water and cistern water storage and a chicken house and yard are also part of the exterior. A 1700 foot grass air strip is also there. Part of the 11,000 square foot underground is a shop/garage. There is a 47 yard drive-in door and a diesel generator. Entry tunnels are 150 feet of the underground area. A massive 6,500 square foot of living space is underground. The underground home comprises three levels. The great room has a stage.

"Sunset Zoological Park","Kansas","Sunset Zoological Park - Manhattan, Kansas - small zoo animals from all over the world","The Sunset Zoological Park, which is located in Manhattan, Kansas, was founded in 1929 by the city of Manhattan. Originally, this piece of land was supposed to be used for a cemetery, but the ground was too rocky to bury bodies. The area was donated to be a zoo instead, and it was charted as a park in 1934, a few years after they began housing animals. The zoo is split into five areas, based on where the animals are found in the wild. One of the most popular areas is the Kansas Plains, which has species that can be found in Kansas such as the raccoon, the swift fox, the turkey vulture, the bald eagle, and the bobcat. This area also has a prairie dog exhibit, where guests can see a family of prairie dogs living and playing. Nearby, guests can visit the Australian Walk-About exhibit, which has wallabies, emus, and an Australian aviary, as well as the African Forest Trail, which features colobus monkeys, chimpanzees, cheetahs, and an African bird exhibit. One of the newest animal species at the Sunset Zoological Park is the Geoffrey's marmoset. Visitors can see these marmosets in the Trails of South America exhibit, which also has maned wolves, giant anteaters, Caribbean flamingos, red-eared sliders, llamas, red-footed tortoises, South American waterfowl, Chacoan peccaries, reed titi monkeys, and poison dart frogs. In this area, guests can also visit the Contact Corral, where they can get close to goats and pot-bellied pigs. The Contact Corral is a popular place for children. The fifth area of the Sunset Zoological Park is the Asian Forest Trail. They feature more Asian animals than most zoos, and some of those found here include the Siberian (Amur) tiger, the sloth bear, the snow leopard, the chukar partridge, the golden pheasant, the red panda, the red-crowned crane, the tufted dear, the Asian small clawed otter, and the cinerous vulture. This area is also home to Brownie, the zoo's grizzly bear, who is estimated to be around 50-55 years old. Guests may also notice that there's a house inside of the zoo. At one time, the zoo's superintendent lived in this house. Today, the house is home to zoo security so that someone is always on the premises to ensure the animals are safe around the clock. Other structures at the zoo include indoor habitat viewing areas, a pavilion, and the Chautauqua Amphitheater. The Sunset Zoological Park is also home to two butterfly gardens. These areas of the zoo are planted with flowers that are specifically meant to attract butterflies that are native to Kansas. The zoo is available for events such as birthday parties, weddings, and corporate events.

"Sycamore Ridge Golf Course","Kansas","Sycamore Ridge Golf Course, Spring Hill, Kansas - Golf Digest's Pick for #1 Public Golf Course in Kansas","Sycamore Ridge Golf Course is an 18-hole championship course, which Golf Digest has consistently ranked as the #1 Public Golf Course in Kansas six years running. Zagat concurred, ranking the course as its #1 Public Golf Course in Kansas in 2009. The par-72 course is also one of the most challenging when played from the back tees, with a yardage of 7,055, a USGA rating of 76.2 and a slope rating of 150 on Bent grass. An interesting feature of the course is the distinct difference between the front nine and the back nine. The front nine features gently rolling topography and a wide-open, links-style design, while the elevated back nine has been carved out of mature woodlands. Water comes into play on 10 holes, and there are lots of bunkers and natural waste areas to add to the challenge. The greens are Bermuda grass and vary in both size and undulation. One of the most noteworthy holes is the par-3 No. 8. This uphill hole plays to 174 yards from the White tees, 215 from the Black, but the rise in elevation makes it an even longer hole that will force golfers to add a club length or two. The tee shot passes through a wide opening in the trees, over an initial shallow rough ravine to an expansive green, but the challenge is not over. The green is difficult to read and features some gentle undulations. Another particularly noteworthy hole is No. 9. This par-5 plays to a manageable 470 yards from the White tees and 525 from the Blacks. It's also one of the most scenic holes, as the fairway doglegs to the right around a lake. Any tee shot right of the fairway will be in trouble, as the lake, sand and native grasses guard the entire right side up to the green. On the back nine, the change in course style becomes immediately apparent as the links give way to tree-lined fairways. Hole No. 10 is also rated the most difficult on the course. At 467 yards from the back tees, it's a hike, but only 368 yards from the Whites. In either case, the fairway is narrow and slopes right to left, while water cuts through the fairway to guard the front of the green. The next hole is also one of the most scenic and one that leaves little margin for error. This par-5 plays downhill from an elevated tee into a tree-lined valley. At 544 yards from the back tees, laying up is the only option for most golfers. And even those choosing the much more manageble 427 yards from the White tees will have to think twice as they approach a green surrounded by water. The par-4 No. 12 is the signature hole and presents golfers standing on the elevated tee with a visually intimidating sight. Trees line this hole like the outside of a funnel, there's a forced carry over some nasty rough, and a creek runs the length of the hole on the right. Practice facilities include a range with natural grass teeing area, along with putting and chipping greens with a sand bunker. Lessons are also available from the staff teaching professional."

"Topeka Zoo","Kansas","Topeka Zoo - Topeka Kansas - mid-sized city zoo on 80 acres","The Topeka Zoological Gardens, better known as the Topeka Zoo, is a medium-sized municipal zoo located within Gage Park in Topeka. The 80 acre park is also home to a Rose Garden and a small-gauge railway. The Topeka Zoo is built on land that was deeded to the city by the Gage family in 1899. The original purpose of the land grant was to provide a place for the citizens of Topeka and their friends to enjoy activities to promote health, comfort and recreation. The first zoo facilities were built in the Northeast corner of Gage Park in 1933. While the Topeka Zoo added animals and exhibits throughout the 1940s and the 1950s, it wasn't until 1960 that the City of Topeka hired its first permanent Zoo Director. That was the same year that a group of citizens formed the non-profit Friends of the Topeka Zoo, whose aim was to promote capital improvements at the zoo and support educational opportunities for all citizens of Topeka. In 1966, the Topeka Zoo opened its first truly major project, the Large Mammal House, as a home and exhibit for great apes, giraffe, elephants and hippos. The Large Mammal House still exists, though it has changed considerably over the decades. Today, it is called the Animals and Man building, and is home to the Africa elephants, Asian elephants, hippos, giraffes, colobus, lemurs, storks, cranes, and a number of other smaller animals. The Animals and Man exhibit includes a shade area and pool for the elephants, as well as a 28,000 gallon outdoor pool for the hippos. One of the most popular exhibits at the Topeka Zoo is the Tropical Rain Forest, a dome with a 100-foot diameter that is home to numerous mammals, reptiles and birds in a biome designed for their comfort. Nearby, the Jungle Cats exhibit offers a similar environment for the Zoo's leopards and Sumatran tigers, allowing them room to roam, climb and relax. The Topeka Zoo is also home to a family pride of lions living in the appropriately named Lion's Pride exhibit. In addition to the cats, visitors to the Topeka Zoo can visit zebras on the African Savannah, a quartet of bears in the Black Bear woods and Bornean Orangutans at the Discovering Apes exhibit. For the youngest visitors, there is the Security Benefit Children's Zoo, where children can meet and interact with common farm animals like sheep, goats, cows and a pig. The Zoo is small enough that a family can see all the exhibits in an hour, but it's also easily possible to spend much more time visiting each of the exhibits and observing the animals. The Zoo provides educational opportunities through EdZoocation activities, and offers a $1 per person admission for all school groups visiting the zoo. The Topeka Zoo is open year round from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Admission prices are nominal, with discounts available for groups and based on age. For more information about hours and admission at the Topeka Zoo, contact the zoo at 785-368-9180."

"Wichita Art Museum","Kansas","Wichita Art Museum, Wichita, Kansas","The Wichita Art Museum in Kansas is the largest art museum in the state. It houses many collections from American Art. The displays span three centuries with masterpieces from Mary Cassatt, Winslow Homer, Horace Pippin, Edward Hopper and Charles Russell. The permanent collection includes about 7,000 works of art.

Admission for adults is $5, for children it is $2, and seniors is $4. The location of the museum is on West Museum Boulevard near the Botanica Wichita Gardens. Louise Caldwell Murdock wished the Roland P. Murdock collection would go into a museum. To make this happen she wrote a will to specify what would happen to her estate. She stated income from her closest relative's death would go to purchase art and a building for the museum. In 1935 the museum was opened to the public. Residents of Wichita lined up to gain access. It took until 1939 for the first Murdock painting to be on display. The museum grew exponentially over the next forty years; eventually in the 1970's a new facility had to be erected. In 2003 an addition was finished to add more space. Each year there are exhibitions at the Wichita Art Museum. For example in 2009 a Tribute to Edgar Allan Poe, Fantasies and Fairy, and Manipulating the Figure exhibits have been or will be on display. In 2010 a Born to Be Published exhibition will be displayed. Some of the exhibitions will be ongoing, while others will last a few weeks or months. Permanent collections at the Wichita Art Museum include the Roland P. Murdock display of a hundred and sixty- eight paintings from the colonial period, the L.S. and Ida L. Naftzger Collection, and the friends of the Wichita Art Museum. The L.S. and Ida Collection have more than 200 European, British, and American prints and drawings. The art work dates to the 16th through the 20th centuries. The Friends display is 256 paintings, sculptures, and graphics from American artists like Georgia O'Keeffe.
