"Arrow rock Dam and Reservoir","Idaho","Arrow rock Dam and Reservoir, Boise, Idaho","Along the Boise River is one of the attractions of Boise, Idaho tourists may want to visit. Arrow rock Dam was completed in 1915, but planning for this dam began five years earlier. Originally the Reclamation Service felt a place east of the dam's actual location would work the best. However, after surveys it was decided that the Arrowrock site would be better. It sits at the main channel and the south fork. The purpose of the dam was for irrigation water. Farms needed the water for their agricultural growth. The Reclamation Service had other projects in the past they worked on, but nothing was as large as the dam they built. The Arrow rock Dam is 348 feet. It is also the world's largest concrete arch dam. Before the dam could even be built they had to do a lot of work to stop water from getting in the way. They created a diversion dam twenty miles away from the site of the dam. The dam has a capacity of 300,850 acre feet with a catchment area of 2,200 square miles. The surface area is 3,100 acres. Height for the dam is 350 feet, with a length of 1,150 feet. To get power to the dam the service had to create a small powerhouse, which was finished in 1912. They also installed three generators that have 1,500 kilowatts of electricity. These generators helped provide power to the Arrow rock's camp, saw mills, and cement mixers. German made Allis Chalmers turbines with 725 horsepower were put at the dam. They were the first to be in a vertical shaft design. In 1976 the dam was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The state did have to refurbish the site in 2002 to make it ready for reserve status. Now during peak times of power demand the dam and its turbines help to supply more electricity. Visitors to the Boise, Idaho area can stay near the dam to enjoy a number of activities. The dam creates a reservoir of water, which is used in the warmer months of the year for swimming, boating, fishing, and recreation. Campers come from around the United States to stay at the Reservoirs camping facilities. They have water, power, and shower facilities on site. The campgrounds are Cottonwood Creek, Irish Point, and Willow Creek. For individuals not interested in camping there are hotels near the Arrow rock Dam and Reservoir. These hotels include Valley Creek Motel, Riverside Motel, Sawtooth Lodge, Springhill Suites, and Boise Guest House. Restaurants close by include Harley's Pub, Crow Inn, and Trolley House. A few miles from the Dam area are Hulls Gulch Nature Trail, Thunder Mountain Line, and the Old Idaho Penitentiary. There are also some nature trails around the dam, though not as impressive as those listed previously. The area is mostly barren with short plants and trees covering the earth. However, the hills do make for a nice adventure to overlook the dam and reservoir. Some photos can be taken at several points."
"Bald Mountain","Idaho","Bald Mountain, Sun Valley, Idaho","Idaho is a plentiful state for mining, skiing, and any number of recreational activities. One place for tourists to visit is Bald Mountain. This mountain is 9150 feet in height. It is located in the central part of Idaho near the city of Ketchum. Bald Mountain is the home to several ski resorts including the Sun Valley Ski Resort. This resort is the oldest and was built as an Alpine Resort like those in Europe. The resort was the first one to create ski runs at various skill levels. The fact that wind does not affect the runs makes it an even better place to ski. It was four years after the resort was established that Bald Mountain got its ski lift, with three single chairlifts. The chairs would take guests almost to the summit. As one of the higher summits in Idaho one can see in the distance to other towns and cities of the region. The base level of the mountain is 5750 feet where the Big Wood River is. A vertical drop of 3400 feet runs along the north face of the mountain. Today it is served by 14 ski lifts, 7 quads, 4 triples, 2 doubles, and 1 surface lift. Bald Mountain offers 75 runs over 2054 acres of land. 645 acres are considered snow making. There are 36 percent easy runs, 42 percent intermediate, and 22 percent very difficult runs on Bald Mountain. Anyone skiing the mountain should have some skill before taking on even the easy runs. Dollar Mountain near Bald Mountain is best for novice skiers. Bald Mountain is not just open during the winter. At all seasons there is something to do at the mountain location. During the summer lift tickets and passes can be obtained for hiking up towards the summit and the other trails. Biking is key to the mountain during the summer months. The ski lift will take passengers and their bikes to the top for extreme mountain biking. Climbers and hikers can also start at the bottom and work their way up towards the top. River Run Lodge, Warm Springs Lodge, Seattle Ridge Lodge, and Dollar Mountain Lodge are available for tourists to stay at Bald Mountain. From the lodges it is possible to reach the various trails. The winter trails do include Nordic or cross country ski trails. There is one very long loop with shorter loops to take skiers off to the side. They can take the 42 kilometer loop or spend the day taking three or four mile trips. The Dollar lodge provides the Dollar Cabin Restaurant for skiers to rejuvenate at. Depending on where skiers come down there are other places to eat as well. For the summer trails the Bald Mountain trail, Broadway trail, Cold Springs trail, Traverse trail, and Warm Springs trail are open. Warm Springs trail is 8 miles up and down hill for hiking and biking. There is a meadow where the wind comes through, located at Monarch Ridge."
"Basque Museum and Cultural Center","Idaho","Basque Museum and Cultural Center, Boise, Idaho","Boise, Idaho is a Basque Spanish region. Immigrants in early times moved to Boise, where they were well known for their hard work and perseverance of the tough western state. Downtown in the capital city is the Basque Museum and Cultural Center. The museum is very important to the maintenance of the Basque cultural heritage. In 1985 the museum was placed in the Cyrus Jacobs- Uberuaga historical house. Some artifacts have been donated to the museum in order to increase the development of the exhibits. Displays, classrooms, library, kitchen, and gift store are all housed in the same building. At the library are oral history archives, manuscript materials, photographs, and records and tape collections. Museum hours are Tuesday through Friday 10am to 4pm, Saturday 11am to 3pm, and Sunday, Monday, and Holidays closed. Admission is inexpensive at $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and $2 for children. Children under 5 are free. Memberships for a full year of access are $35 for adults and $25 for seniors. A present exhibit is the Basque Whaling: Danger and Daring on a Distant Shore display. The display tells of tales where chilling waters and rocky shores lead to the trail to Idaho for the Basque whaler. Treasures from the 16th century such as whaling galleons that shipped between America and eastern Canada are at the museum. Testimonies of the dangers the Basque whalers face are shared. Artisans have depicted some scenes that these Basques would have faced from shipbuilding in the Dark Ages to the early 19th centuries. The house is an exhibit in itself. The home was a boarding place in 1910 until 1969. Families such as the Galdos, Bicandi, and Uberuaga rented the house. The Uberuaga's bought the house in 1928 for $2000. The idea of the house was to be a home for immigrants who didn't necessarily have the means to buy a home when they first arrived. There are four exhibits that remain at the Basque Museum and Cultural Center. The Oral Histories section is audio and pictorial representations of the past. Interviews with Basque people regarding the American West for research are available to hear. A grant even provided the Basque Government to obtain these interviews so that others could hear them. For example the University of Nevada in Reno has a copy of some of these tapes. The Joseph Eiguren Library is filled with books, papers, and manuscripts from Basque peoples. A short introduction on the naming of the library is shared before tourists begin. The library was named because Eiguren gave his collection to the museum. Another important section of the museum is the Jay Uberuaga Hormaechea. This exhibit is hundreds of photo albums and scrapbooks that the man kept. Events happen each year at the museum to gain public interest. These events can be private groups renting the museum property or public events. The museum store allows visitors to take home replicas of artifacts they see at the museum to remember their visit."

"Boise Mormon Temple","Idaho","Boise Mormon Temple, Boise, Idaho","The Boise Mormon Temple was not the first temple to be built in Idaho. In 1945 a temple in Idaho Falls was constructed, even though it was not the capital. President Grant visited the Boise during this time to support the construction of a temple. It was his idea that the temple be built in Idaho Falls rather than Boise. At the time there were more congregates in Idaho Falls. By 1982 the Boise area had enough members to build their own temple, as President Grant had suggested on his visit. 5,000 members turned up for the groundbreaking ceremony. When the building was finally completed, over 120,000 visitors and 246 ministers came to view the temple. Those in charge at the temple only expected 70,000 visitors. In the first year the temple was open it was filled to over 100 percent capacity. Due to the amount of attendees the temple had to be closed two and a half years later in order to expand the space. In 1987 the Boise Mormon Temple was reopened with additional dressing rooms, office space, a new baptistery, and cafeteria. The Boise Mormon Temple is located on I-84. The architecture of the temple was and is amazing. It is one of the reasons tourists visit the temple. It has a variegated outside with a sloping roof and six spires.

"Circling Raven Golf Course","Idaho","Circling Raven Golf Course, Worley, Idaho - Regarded as the Best Tribal Golf Course in America","When the Cour d'Alene Indian Tribe in Northern Idaho was ready to expand its casino and hotel complex by adding a golf course, the tribe brought in six golf-course architects to make their pitch. They chose the one whose proposal took the most difficult route through the available land - the part protected by wetlands and a railroad track. The result is Circling Raven Golf Course, designed by Gene Bates and opened in 2003. At 420 acres and more than eight miles of cart path, Circling Raven is a display of rolling meadows, stately pine trees and wide-open northwestern vistas. It also routes through and around wetlands, and even passes through a tunnel beneath the Burlington Railroad track in order to connect to the rest of the course. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,189 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.5 and a slope rating of 140. As the eight miles of cart path attest, Circling Raven is a big course that calls for hitting driver on most of the par-4s and par-5s. Even the par-3 No. 13, which plays to 253 yards from the longest tees, may require a driver off the tee to carry the wetlands. The signature hole for the course is the par-4 No. 8. Like most of the course, the hole has a secluded feeling. At 386 yards, it's a relatively short par-4, framed by pines trees and requiring a forced carry over the native grasses to find a fairway that slopes to the right. Another noteworthy hole is the par-5 No. 12, which is rated the most difficult on the back nine. A scenic, albeit challenging brute, the hole requires a drive of up to 275-300 yards to reach the fairway off the tee. The hole works left, then right, then back left again as it winds through clusters of pine trees and clover-shaped bunkers. Since its opening, Circling Raven has received a number of honors and accolades. In 2008, GOLF Magazine ranked it No. 93 on its list of Top 100 Courses You Can Play,'' as well one of the Top 10 Best New'' golf courses. Golfweek Magazine rated it the Number 11 Best Casino Course'' in America in 2008. And the course is also generally regarded as the best tribal golf course in America. The course also boasts some unique practice facilities, including a range just for wedges hit to various practice greens. The 25-acre practice facility also offers a full driving range, as well as chipping and putting greens. Lessons are also available. The Circling Raven Golf Club also boasts a pro shop that features the latest golf equipment and apparel, as well as specialty items - such as jewelry, dinnerware, glassware, frames, and tribal art - typically not found in such venues. The PGA has nominated Circling Raven Golf Club as Pacific Northwest PGA Resort Merchandiser of the Year'' several times. The Cour d'Alene Hotel features 202 rooms, as well as two restaurants, a lounge with live entertainment, and the casino. The casino has more than 1,600 video gaming machines, offers off-track betting, and also schedules events such as professional boxing and concerts in its ballroom. The resort also has an indoor swimming pool and Jacuzzi."

"Coeur d'Alene Lake","Idaho","Coeur d'Alene Lake, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","In Idaho visitors can find the Snake River, Idaho River, and several lakes. In the panhandle of Idaho sits Coeur d'Alene, a city of more than 30,000 residents. The city is bordered by Coeur d'Alene Lake. The lake is 25 miles long, and 1 to 3 miles wide. The lake has 109 miles of shoreline. Residents and visitors are able to use the lake for boating and fishing activities during the warmer months. The lake is fed by Coeur d'Alene River and Saint Joe River. At the other side the lake runs out into the Spokane River. The lake is at 2,125 feet elevation. Lake Coeur d'Alene was formed during the melting after the ice age. When glaciers were spread throughout North America and the temperatures began to rise again the glaciers in Idaho began to melt. The result of this melting was the glacial formation of Lake Coeur d'Alene. Each summer the dam at the Spokane River helps the lake rise 7 feet. The lake is used for transporting lumber from Kootenai County. The industry first began in the late 19th century, continuing through the 1900's. In 1917 a fire occurred which drastically affected the lumber industry and the county seat of Kootenai. It was during this time that many of the Kootenai lumber mills moved to Coeur d'Alene at the river junctions of the Coeur d'Alene and St. Joe Rivers. An interesting fact about the lake is the model T's that can be found on the bottom of the lake. In the early 1900's people felt they could save time by driving across the lake to reach other places. Unfortunately, a lot of the time the lake was not as solid as they thought it would be. This caused the ice to break up and the cars to sink. Some steamboats can also be found on the bottom of the lake as well. Steamboats that caught fire would burn till they sunk, and when ferries were no longer used they set the boats on fire to get rid of them. Scuba divers learning in Idaho tend to frequent this lake to see the wreckage at the bottom. For other tourists who do not dive, boating and the beaches are one of the pastimes. Local residents and tourists come to the lake and surrounding forest to view bald eagles that eat kokanee in the lake. Wolf Lodge Bay is a good spot for viewing these birds. The North Idaho Centennial Trail is popular for tourists hiking, walking, biking, or jogging on the north and northeastern shores. Tubbs Hill Nature Trails on the other side allow for visitors to hike up the hill and look out over the lake. The Environmental Protection Agency has ruled that the Coeur d'Alene Tribe can own a third of the lake for fishing, water, and basic living. They get to maintain this area of the lake without interference from the city government. It is also off limits for tourists to help maintain water quality."
"Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course","Idaho","Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho - A #1 Ranking for ``Beauty and Esthetics'' by Golf Digest","The Coeur d'Alene Resort Golf Course has received many accolades since opening in 1991. But perhaps the most telling is a #1 ranking in the category of Beauty and Esthetics'' by Golf Digest magazine. Nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains on the shores of Lake Coeur d'Alene in North Idaho, the course was designed by Scott Miller to offer a stimulating round of golf, surrounded by a park-like environment.'' The result is a course of lush carpets of Bent Grass, acres of fragrant Juniper trees, striking accent beds of red Geraniums, and the mountainous water challenges provides by the lake and Fernan Creek. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 6,803 yards at its longest, and features several distinctive geographic features. These include gently rolling woodlands, a forested ridge, a lakeshore, and a revitalized trout stream in Fernan Creek. The course has been lauded as playable for families, yet challenging enough to test even professional players. The course is also home to a truly unique feature - the world's only floating island green. The world-renowned 14th hole features a 15,000-square-foot putting surface that is literally floating and can be repositioned anywhere between 95 and 200 yards offshore. Depending upon moisture content, the green weighs in the neighborhood of 5,000,000 lbs. To reach the green from the tee, golfers will need some steady nerves and confidence. To reach it for putting purposes, golfers board the Putter Boat Shuttle for a short ride to finish what could be the most unforgettable island green in the golf world. Golfers who complete the hole even receive a Certificate of Achievement on the shuttle ride back to land. That's one reason the course and resort have been christened America's Greatest Golf Experience.'' Other accolades included a #7 ranking among Resort Golf Courses in America in the 2009 Golf World Magazine Readers' Choice awards, and a 5-Star Designation from Golf Digest, an honor accorded to only 16 out of the 6,200 courses rated. Practice facilities are available, including an over-water driving range, 2,400-square-foot putting green, a 3,500-square-foot chipping green, as well as practice sand bunkers. Lessons are also available, and the Golf Pro Shop offers a full line of equipment, as well as unique Floating Green Logo Apparel and gift items. For dining, golfers can avail themselves of the Floating Green Restaurant & Snack Bar overlooking the famous 14th tee and the island green. The on-site restaurant is open for breakfast, lunch, dinner and after-golf cocktails. Other amenities and activities of the Coeur d'Alene Resort include hiking, fishing, white water rafting and skiing. The resort also offers a luxury spa and a number of dining options, ranging from casual to five-star gourmet fare. Guests of the resort stay in lakefront and lake-view rooms and suites to maximize the views of the lake and surrounding mountains."
"Cog Hill Golf & Country Club, Course #4, Lemont, Illinois ? A Nationally Ranked Golf Course Since 1964, Now New and Improved","Idaho","Cog Hill Golf & Country Club, Course #4, Lemont, Illinois ? A Nationally Ranked Golf Course Since 1964, Now New and Improved","The Cog Hill Golf & Country Club in Lemont, Illinois is one of the premier golfing venues in the country, with 72 holes of championship golf. The #4 Course, nicknamed Dubsdread,'' is considered the best of the bunch. The Course #4 has been nationally ranked since it opened for play in 1964, then underwent a $5 million renovation from September 2007 to September 2008 by renowned golf-course architect Rees Jones. According to a press release issued by Cog Hill Golf & Country Club, the renovations maintain the original routing of the course, but ...upgraded the course's features and restored the strategy, design integrity and overall character inherent in the work of original architects Dick Wilson and Joe Lee. Dubsdread remains a pleasant challenge for the average golfer, but will offer more strategic shot-making options and risk-reward challenges for the tour professional.'' The renovations included reconstructing all 18 greens and tee boxes, reshaping the fairways, significant tree management and repositioning, the sculpting of 98 bunkers, and adding a pond to hole No. 7.  The par-4 finishing hole has also been revamped to 497 yards, including relocating the green perilously close to the nearby water. A SubAir System was also installed on all 18 grees and accounts for one of the biggest investments in the renovation. The SubAir system is an aeration and moisture-removal system that acts like a vacuum and subsurface drainage under the greens, accelerating the draingage process. At the time this was written, Dubsdread is the only course in the Chicago area to make use of the system. Thus far, the new course has been well-received, including a return to a ranking among the 50 best golf courses in the United States. Dubsdread came in at No. 45 on the 2009 Golf Digest list of America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses,'' marking the 18th appearance for the course on the list. The course is also home to the PGA Tour's BMW Championship event. The par-72 course now plays to 6,940 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.4 and a slope rating of 142 on Bent grass. Cog Hill Golf & Country Club also features some outstanding practice and learning facilities. The practice area includes a combination of natural-grass hitting areas, target greens, Callaway range balls, and a well-groomed short-game area. The Golf Range Association of America Magazine also recently named Cog Hill's Learning Center as one of the Top 100 Ranges in America.'' Cog Hill Golf & Country Club also offers a number of instructional options, including the No Embarrassment Golf School (NEGS), a mentor program, and the Dave Pelz Scoring Game Golf School for more advanced golfers looking to improve their scoring. The club also features a golf shop and staff which is recognized by major golf club manufacturers as a top, club-fitting site. Cog Hill also features a large, old-world'' style clubhouse with three dining rooms that can be converted to one large dining room with a seating capacity of 350."
"Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in Idaho an Eerie Sight","Idaho","Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in Idaho an Eerie Sight","	Located in the Snake River Plain of central Idaho, Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve has often been referred to as one of the strangest landscapes in the United States. The unusual terrain of this volcanic area represents one of the best preserved flood basalt areas in the continental U.S. The national monument area covers about 715, 000 acres (1,100 square miles) and is located close to the town of Arco, Idaho. Declared a monument in 1924 and a preserve in 2002, the attraction draws a crowd of about 250,000 visitors per year. It is managed jointly by the National Park Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Volcanic features dominant the landscape at the Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve, which encompasses three major lava fields and approximately 400 square miles of sagebrush steppe grasslands, which is a dry, treeless, level ecosystem. More than 25 volcanic cones can be explored here, most lying along the Great Rift of Idaho, a series of fractures in the earth's crust. The only other area similar to this is in Africa. Most guests begin their tour of Craters on the Moon at the Visitor Center, where they can take advantage of a video presentation, various exhibits, a bookstore, and advice from rangers who are available to help plan hikes and other expeditions around the park. For those who prefer a driving tour, a 7-mile scenic loop winds around the national monument area and allows guests to either view the landscape from their automobile or depart and take advantage of walking/hiking trails along the way. Most of the trails off the scenic loop road are accessible and are a half-mile or shorter and not strenuous. However, they allow guests to see more than they would from their cars. Those wishing to partake of longer hikes should be prepared for uneven terrain that's difficult on the feet and legs and demands some degree of physical prowess. Because of the black lava, hiking trails are hot and dry, so hikers should prepare appropriately, especially during the summer months. Trails range from .5 miles to about 8 miles, the latter leading to Echo Crater, an eerie moonscape that's fascinating to explore. The trip to Echo Crater many include backpacking and a stay in the park's backcountry. Winter activities include cross country skiing on a groomed track that ranges from 4 to 7 miles long, depending on weather conditions. Telemark skiing is available on the slopes of the cinder cones and skiers are permitted to leave the groomed track but do so at their own risk. In addition, the 1.5-mile Snowshoe Loop Trail provides a different kind of winter experience. Guided snowshoe walks are often scheduled during January and February. There is no lodging or food services at the park. Amenities can be enjoyed in the town of Arco, which is about a 30 minute drive from the park."
"Crystal Gold Mine","Idaho","Crystal Gold Mine, Kellogg, ID","The panhandle of Idaho is home to many mines such as the one in Kellogg, Idaho. Kellogg was supposedly discovered by a prospector named Noah Kellogg in 1885. The site where Noah's donkey found an outcropping of galena became the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mines. Asign in the town states that This is the town founded by a jackass and inhabited by his descendants''. The Bunker Hill Mine closed in 1981 and the townfaced a decline. Even though there were still mines open many people were out of work. The town has developed into a resort area today with hotels, restaurants, shops, Water Park, golf course and condos to entice visitors. There is also the Silver Mountain Resort for winter skiing. One of the most popular attractions for everyone is the Crystal Gold Mine. The mine dates from the 1880's and was a working gold mine. The mine features guided tours which are educational and fun. Visitors don't need a reservation to tour the Crystal Gold Mine, they can just show up. There are plenty of parking spaces for cars, buses and RV's. Visitors can bring food and eat in the picnic area. The mine is open all year regardless of weather. The temperature of the mine stays at forty eight degrees Fahrenheit so visitors are advised to bring a coat or sweater. Guests touring the Crystal Gold Mine can bring video and flash cameras on the tour. A tour lasts about thirty minutes and has concrete walkways for easy walking. There is also no climbing involved so all ages are welcome to the mine. The tour guides give demonstrations of Hand Steeling - a mining technique. The facility is well lit for everyone's safety and the State of Idaho performs inspections regularly. Tom Irwin was a gold prospector that discovered a gold vein in 1879. He mined the vein that he found for three years then left. The mine lay hidden for over a hundred years before it was discovered again. They found his tracks, mine car and tools so they thought that perhaps he had intended to return. The mine was found in 1991 when the owner of the property found water seeping out of the hillside. He found the portal, but closed it up again. He sold the property in 1996 to the present owner who was a retired miner. The new owner uncovered the mine and re opened it as a tourist attraction. Crystal Gold Mine is open from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm in the winter and 9:00 am to 6:00 pm in the summer. Admission prices are Adults: twelve dollars, Kids (4-17): eight dollars and fifty cents, Kids (under four): free, Seniors: eleven dollars and a Family rate of five people: forty five dollars.

"Discovery Center of Idaho","Idaho","Discovery Center of Idaho, Boise, Idaho","Space is constantly fascinating to adults and children. To bring space to visitors the Discovery Center of Idaho offers many exhibits based on NASA research. The mission state for Discovery Center states that they want to offer an educational facility that is both interesting and fun for their visitors. The creators of the museum are going to have science, math and technology exhibits. These exhibits provide interactive activities, educational programs, and teacher resources. Admission hours are Monday through Thursday from 9am to 5pm, Friday 9am to 7pm, Saturday 10am to 5pm, and Sunday noon to 5pm.

The science store allows for visitors to take home souvenirs of their visit. Puzzles, scientific toys, books, and much more can be found in the store. They offer a discount for those with memberships. One exhibit is the Air Brake Chair. This chair uses a pulley system with air brakes. Visitors can sit in the chair and pull themselves up six feet in the air. They can then let go of the rope. The pulley keeps the load up in the air because of the air brakes. The wings on the chair offer resistance, so that the chair doesn't sail back to the ground without a smooth motion. The Discovery Market is a place for children five and under to explore. Children can fill carts with fake food products, learn how to total up the amount, and even cooperate with other individuals. In the Exhibit Gallery is a high and low pressure display. This display shows the earth from outer space. Visitors can watch high and low pressure systems move around the earth. Hurricanes can be seen swirling around in the display. The Centripetal Wheel is entertaining for children because stuffed animals will cling to the outer cylinder wheel from the force of the spin created. Perhaps a most spectacular machine is the Dune. The Dune Machine shows the shifting of sand around objects like snow and sand does in nature. The Turbulent Orb is a globe so that visitors can see the swirling of turbulence that occurs in nature. Tornadoes in the Mid West are dangerous. Researchers constantly try to improve their knowledge, and one way they do this is by simulating tornadoes. The Tornado machine at the Discovery Center is 7 feet tall. The tornado swirls up from the ground towards the sky. The Bernoulli Blower shows how objects can float up with just a little air pressure. The Bubble Wall is a place where gigantic bubbles are formed. Tourists can even stick their heads in the soap wall without breaking the bubble apart. Another section has a display to show real bones and what an x-ray bone would look like. The entire museum is based on scientific research exhibits to help educate the public, especially about space, as well as the earth."
"Downata Hot Springs","Idaho","Downata Hot Springs, Downey, Idaho","Downata Hot Springs in Downey, Idaho have a fairly long history. The springs are located three miles to the south of Downey where many people from around the United States and other locations visit. The Springs'' as they were first called began when Alexander Marshall and his family moved to the area. Knowing that they had a tourist attraction in the hot springs they built a resort and a pool. The hot water of the spring bubbles up from the rocky bottom. The springs are located to the south of the manmade pool. The reason a pool was built is because the water of the springs is actually 109 degrees Fahrenheit. The water is cooled down before it is piped into the pool. This allows the water to be more comfortable for swimming. The Marshall family moved to the springs in 1907 and since then their family has been operating the resort. At the beginning the Marshalls only had three dressing rooms then 25 more were added around the pool. The resort did not come until 1929. Those working on the resort dug a hole that was 50 by 100 feet for the pool. They poured concrete into the bottom and lighted the area at night with 30 gas lanterns. In 2001 it was necessary to do a few renovations at the resort and pool. A new sewer system was installed, a paved entrance to the campground was laid, and a new slide replaced the silver slide that was put in originally. The pool is open year round for visitors. It is possible to host pool parties or just soak in the warm waters. Each season the resort has thirty employees to work the pool. The arthritis foundation and aerobic classes are held at the pool for individuals seeking the warm natural waters for its healing qualities. The resort offers candlelight dinners, massages, breakfast, and soak nights to visitors during the off peak season. Today there is more than one pool on the site. The different pools allow for different temperatures and options. There are four water slides at the park. They are the Sea Serpent, Little Green Hole, Black Hole, and Dragon. The Little Green Hole and Dragon are gentler slides for the younger children. The other two slides take a winding long path to the bottom. Each summer thousands of tourists and residents of Downey line up to travel down the slides. The Downata Hot Springs can reach a temperature of 112 degrees Fahrenheit. In the summer the pools will range from 85 to 99 degrees Fahrenheit. During the winter the temperatures are typically 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. There is a hot tub that is kept at 102 to 106 degrees Fahrenheit. All the pools, water slides, and hot tub are fed by the hot springs water. The spring flows about 600 gallons per minute. The pool is drained several times a week to keep the water fresh for the number of visitors that comes through."

The course was originally opened in 1973, and was the product of a co-design by Robert Trent Jones, Sr. and Robert Trent Jones, Jr. According to a spokesperson for the course, the differences in design philosophies between father and son can be seen between the front and back nine. The senior Jones' influence is apparent on the front nine, which features elevated tees, dramatic mountain vistas, rolling fairways, and his signature large bunkers. Because of the elder Jones' design, the front nine typically calls for long approach shots The back nine is quite different and reflects the younger Jones' influence, which can be seen in a more level layout that plays through a meadow and brings Elkhorn Creek and several ponds into play on eight of the nine holes. On the back nine, accuracy in shot making is more highly valued than the long approach shots of the front The course has changed ownership many times over the years, and recently underwent a $3 million renovation, reopening for business in July of 2005. Prior to that renovation, the par-72 championship Elkhorn Golf Course was rated as the 25th best golf course in the U.S. by Golf Illustrated, and the 16th best by Golf Digest. According to Elkhorn head golf pro Shane Galles, the course is known for its wide-open views and variety of terrain throughout the golf course. Most golfers find Elkhorn a very challenging golf course, but during the renovation, additional tee boxes were added to give golfers the opportunity for more choices and improved player friendliness. In addition, the renovation included five redesigned greens as well as 14 rebuilt greens, new and reconfigured bunkers, new turf grasses and cart paths, a new, state-of-the-art irrigation system, and new vegetation. The course now plays to 7,214 yards from the black tees, with a USGA rating of 74.2 and a slope rating of 135. The design continues to feature some difficult par-3s, as well as the #1 handicap and signature hole - the massive par-5 No. 5 hole which plays to 650 yards from the back tees. Here, golfers tee off from an elevated tee box, facing directly toward the often snow-capped peaks of the mountains to the north. They then play downhill on an undulating, bunker-lined fairway toward the green. Practice facilities include a two-tiered driving range with bunker, a short-game area with bunker, and a putting green. There's also a Teaching Center located in the old clubhouse that features an indoor net, putting green and video swing analysis area. As part of the renovation, Elkhorn Golf Club received a new, 16,000-square-foot facility housing a fully stocked Golf Shop, locker rooms, a drive-up snack bar and Dining Room."

Because of the varying elevations there are many changes in the terrain, vegetation and climate. The Snake River carved Hells Canyon and can be seen from the west rim in Oregon. The river is farther down than a mile at this point. The Seven Devils Mountains in Idaho has the He Devil Peak, which towers approximately 8,000 feet above the Snake River. Between the three states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area encompasses more than 650,000 acres. Hells Canyon lays in three national forests; the Wallowa - Whitman, Payette and Nez Perce. The forest service is the custodian of the land and they see to the recreation activities, removal of dead or diseased trees and range conditions for the wildlife. There are three rivers in the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area that are designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers by the government. The only way to see some of these areas is to hike or go on horseback. Some nine hundred and twenty five miles of trails are within the boundaries. Recreational activities in these areas include hunting, fishing, horseback riding, backpacking, mountain biking and photography. Finding a professional river guide to run the river is easy as there are many available. The river has many rapids that are classed five and six so a river rafting company is recommended for anyone without experience. Float trips are also available. Two to three days is normal to float from the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area to Pittsburg Landing. Float trips of four to six days will take visitors to Heller Bar. There are thirty six campsites in the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area. Many of the sites have primitive conditions. Most are tent sites with a few trailer sites. Drinking water is only at some of the campsites so campers should be prepared to bring their own. Restrooms at some of the campsites are barrier free instead of the more conventional type. Campers wishing to hike from the campsites will be rewarded as many have trailheads at the campground. Horses are welcome at some of the sites and stock water may be available at these sites. Boat ramps and fishing is an outdoor activity at some of the campgrounds. Not all of the sites have views or look outs. The current conditions, opening dates, fees and water availability can be found at the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area website. For visitors that don't want to camp, there are hotels, dining and shopping in the nearby towns of Lewiston, Idaho or cities in Washington and Oregon."
"Heyburn State Park","Idaho","Heyburn State Park, Plummer, Idaho","Heyburn State Park is perhaps the oldest state park in the Pacific Northwest. The park was founded in 1908 with 5,500 acres of land and an additional 2,300 acres of water. There are three lakes within the park. These lakes are Chatcolet, Benewah, and Hidden Lakes. The St. Joe River also runs through the park at the eastern boundary. Visitors to the park can learn about the natural and cultural history. Before the land became a park it was a place for the Coeur d'Alene Indian tribe to gather. Due to its age the park had to rebuild a few buildings in the 1930's. The Civilian Conservation Corps camp helped to recreate the buildings which were beginning to fall into disrepair. As one can imagine the park is alive with various habitats. Ponderosa pines have grown very large and tall hiding the underbrush of the forest floor. There are grassy hillsides with wildflowers running rampant. On shadier areas there are cedar trees, hemlock and white pine. The lakes are surrounded by marsh and wetland. The wildflowers and plants are plentiful at the lakes too. Summer is one of the best seasons to view Heyburn State Park. The flowers and plants will be in full bloom, and the campgrounds welcome tents and motor homes. The park has three campgrounds with facilities. For the adventurer hiking and biking is permitted along the many designated trails. When out in the wilderness it is possible to glimpse black bears, coyotes, deer, elk and other wildlife. Bird watching is another past time for visitors to enjoy. A few of the trails are currently under construction to help expand the facilities of the park. A sewer project is making it possible to put facilities along the trail, rather than wooden outhouses. Mostly the Lakeshore Loop Trail and the Appaloosa Trail are affected. This will not last long though, so by 2010 these trails might be reopened. Boating at the lakes is possible. Kayaks, canoes, rowboats, and paddle boats are welcome on the lakes. They do allow motorized boats on some of the lakes. However, the boats do have to be registered with the park in order to launch and operate. Inflatable boats that are less than 10 feet do not apply. A bit more on the history of the park is that the Coeur d'Alene Indians are thought to be the first inhabitants. They would build their camps near the lake for fishing and other food sources. Deer, bear, and birds would come to the lakes for water and food. The Native Americans were placed on a reservation, leaving most of the land to the US government. When fishing in the lake visitors can catch pike, pan, or bass. Birds that come to the land are blue heron, osprey, and sparrows. Since there are motorized boats allowed water skiing is one leisure activity visitors enjoy. For gas and other items there is a store and fuel dock at the Rocky Point Marina."

"Idaho Botanical Garden","Idaho","Idaho Botanical Garden, Boise, Idaho","Idaho Botanical Garden located in Boise was started by Christopher Davidson. Davidson earned a PhD in botany. It was his vision that created the gardens in 1984 with a board of directors. The mission of the group was to form a place that would be interesting to visitors. They wanted visitors to learn how to garden, horticulture information, botany, and conservation. To do this the Botanical Garden had to collect a variety of plants. The Garden leases 33 acres of land from Idaho. They currently have 13.5 acres under cultivation. 17 acres is used for nature hikes and environmental education. Visiting the Botanical Gardens can occur throughout the year. From April to October the gardens are open Monday- Friday 9am to 5pm, and weekends 10am to 6pm.

The park has a membership as well. The owners of the Botanical Gardens are working on enlarging the park and enhancing it for visitors. The education center will be a multipurpose facility for social, business, and educational functions. A lobby with gallery, offices, education room, storage, kitchen and restrooms already fill the space. They are working on adding a gift shop, coffee shop, library, and more office space. The Children's Garden is a place for kids and families to discover plants. All ages can walk through the plant world learning the various names, species, and other aspects of the plants.

"Lake Pend Oreille, Hope Idaho","Idaho","Lake Pend Oreille, Hope Idaho","Lake Pend Oreille is located in the northern Idaho Panhandle, near Hope. The lake is 148 square miles. It is 65 miles long and 1,150 feet deep in a few areas. It is the fifth deepest lake in the United States. Lake Pend Oreille is fed by two rivers: Clark Fork and Pack River. It then drains into the Pend Oreille River. Much of the lake is surrounded by national forest. There are a few small towns along the shores of the lake like Hope. The largest residential area is located at Sandpoint. The lake lies in two counties. Bonner County covers all but the southern tip of the lake. At the southern region is Kootenai County, which is home to Farragut State Park. Lake Pend Oreille offers a number of different species of fish. These species include rainbow trout, perch, lake trout, crappie, whitefish, bass, and Kokanee. The forests surrounding the lake are home to Ponderosa Pine, Poplar, Douglas Fir, Quaking Aspen, Western Larch, and Paper Birch. As with the many species of fish there are also a variety of animals in the forests. Whitetail deer, gray wolves, elk, moose, black bears, squirrels, grizzlies, bobcats, and coyotes live in the forests. Birds such as the bald eagle, owls, osprey, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, hawks, ducks, and mountain bluebird also reside in the forests. Some water fowl will migrate in the winter to Lake Pend Orielle. Lake Pend Orielle was formed due to the ice age. Once the ice age ended and the glaciers began to melt a lake formed. The eastern side of the lake is associated as a path for the ancient Missoula Flood. Today the lake is on the south end of the Purcell Trench which was created by glaciers moving from the south away from Canada. Geological research shows the glacier acted as a natural dam on the eastern side, and then the Missoula Flood came. In the past the lake was used by the Kalispell Indian. French fur trappers in the 1800's also came to the lake. It is the French which have given the lake its name. Pend Orielle means ear pendant, which were popular among the Kalispell. Some even believe the lake is shaped like a human ear. During World War II the south end of the lake was used for naval training. The area was built after the attack on Pearl Harbor. This training area was eventually turned into Farragut State Park. The navy used to take large scale submarine prototypes down in the lake since the depth is a lot like the ocean. Today the lake is a popular recreational spot for several of the Idaho towns that surround it. Visitors come to go boating, water skiing, fishing, or even scuba diving in some of the shallower spots. Picnicking around the lake and even camping in a few areas is allowed. Visitors are able to hike through the forests to look down over the lake from a higher vantage point.

The famous explorers Lewis and Clark passed through the area that is Lewiston on their expedition to the Pacific Ocean. They encountered the Nez Perce tribes on their trek. The city was founded in 1861 because of the gold rush in 1860 at Pierce, Idaho. It wasn't too long after that the first newspaper was printed in 1862. Lewiston became the capital of the Idaho Territory in 1863. It remained there until 1865 when the capital was moved to Boise. The gold rush died down in the northern part of the state, but it picked up in the southern sector and this is what precipitated the move. Because of the confluence of two rivers, the Snake and the Clearwater, Lewiston has been developed into a large port city. They have some ocean going vessels that load their cargo to take to the Pacific Ocean. The industry in Lewiston is timber and paper products. The Army Corp of Engineers has completed the dams in the area that make the locks possible. There are many lakes because of the dams and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area is nearby.

It is seventeen miles to the north east of Twin Falls, Idaho. The area is high desert and it is north of the Snake River. The internment camp was run from 1942 through 1945 during the Second World War. There were ten camps that held Japanese Americans during this time. They contained both citizens and resident aliens that lived in the United States at this time. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order number 9066 after Pearl Harbor. This order stated that all people that were of Japanese ancestry couldn't live on the West Coast of the United States. During the time it was open more than nine thousand Japanese Americans were placed there. Most of the people were from Washington, Oregon and Alaska. Although the internment camp was in the Jerome area they didn't want it to be confused with a Relocation Center that was in Jerome, Arkansas at the same time. Minidoka County was the next county over so they used it as the name of the internment camp instead. The Minidoka Internment National Monument became part of the National Register of Historic Places in July of 1979. It finally became established as part of the National Park System in 2001. There are no facilities at the site for visitors nor are there any services. There are remains at the site of the entry guard station and a waiting room. There is also a rock garden. A relocation display is at the Jerome County Museum in Jerome. South east of town they have restored barracks at the Idaho Farm and Ranch Museum. A small marker is adjacent to the remains of the guard station. A large sign has been erected at Highway 25 and Hunt Road. This marker tells some of the history of the internment camp. The Friends of Minidoka have an annual event in June. They sponsor a many day pilgrimage with camp survivors and the general public. In December of 2006, President Bush signed a bill guaranteeing a large amount of money to restore the Minidoka Internment camp as well as nine other former Japanese internment camps. The President also signed the bill Wild Sky Wilderness Act'' in May of 2008 that made the Minidoka Internment a National Historic Site instead of a U.S. National Monument. After visiting the Minidoka Internment National Monument guests can get something to eat in Jerome. They have an assortment of fast food restaurants like McDonald's, Wendy's, Sonic Drive In, and Burger King. There are also some home cooking establishments for a home cooked meal. Visitors can find lodgings in Jerome and Twin Falls, Idaho. Jerome has a Best Western, Days Inn and a local motel to choose from. Twin Falls has more major hotel chains to stay in. There are local festivals, concerts, a farmer's market and sporting events in Jerome. Visitors can also find more outdoor recreation at the many State and National Parks in Idaho."

"National Oregon/California Trail Center","Idaho","National Oregon/California Trail Center, Montpelier, ID","Montpelier, Idaho was once a stop for pioneers traveling on the Oregon or California Trails. The city of Montpelier was settled by the Mormons in 1863 while they were traveling along the Oregon Trail. This area is located in the south eastern part of the State of Idaho in a predominant farming region. It is close to the Utah border. The town was known as Clover Creek by the first Oregon Trail pioneers. The name changed to Belmont later on, but was renamed by Brigham Young himself for a town in his beloved Vermont. The railroad came to Montpelier in 1892 and there was a terminal located in Montpelier until 1972. The Mormons built a temple in the city. Famous outlaws of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch robbed a bank in Montpelier. It has been speculated that they needed the money to bail out a gang member. There is a commemorative plaque on Washington Street. The National Oregon/California Trail Center offers a unique glimpse into the past of these hardy pioneers. They have an interactive indoor wagon train experience at the center. There are live actors and accurate interpretive areas for visitors to enjoy. Guests get to view a gun shop, mercantile and ride in a covered wagon. There is also a group of wagons that have been circled, just like the pioneers would have done at night. This experience can be relived at the Clover Creek Encampment. Visitors can enjoy the Peg Leg Smith Trading Post which is a gift shop. There are exhibits, the Rails and Trails Museum and the Allinger Community Theater. The center has an art show of Oregon Trail paintings that have been created by an Idaho artist, Gary Stone.

While many people may think that a lot of the deaths of the pioneers on the wagon trains were from Indian attacks they would be wrong. The most common threat was from getting run over by the wagon's wheels or from drowning while crossing a swift running river. Diseases such as cholera, small pox, flu, measles, mumps and tuberculosis were also major contributors. This is just some of the information that is presented at the center."
"Nez Perce National Historical Park","Idaho","Nez Perce National Historical Park - Spalding, ID - Park","In 1805, Lewis and Clark first met the Nez Perce Indians. According to them, there were many of these Indians and they lived in numerous villages. Although later history reveals that they wanted to kill Lewis and Clark and his men, they spared them and treated them well because an Indian woman of their tribe had met other white people while she was a prisoner of another tribe and was treated well. According to their own history, the Nez Perce Indians had been here for as long as there was time - for thousands of years. At the time of Lewis and Clark, there were many villages and these were spread across a four state area - Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Montana. The Nez Perce National Historical Park, Spalding, ID, is a center of the many historically preserved sites of the Nez Perce Indians. There are 38 sites in all, but they are spread over a wide area - which would make it impossible to see them all at one time. In fact, visitors would need to travel more than 1,500 miles to do so. Visitors may, however, be able to see up to 26 other sites that are not far from Spalding. The remaining 12 sites are in other states. At the Park in Spalding, Idaho, there is a visitor's center which provides maps of the various sites. The site is the actual location of the first mission to reach the Nez Perce Indians. It was started by Henry and Eliza Spalding. Guests can also see the Nez Perce National Historical Park Museum which reveals a lot of history and artifacts of the Nez Perce people. Rangers present various demonstrations and talk about the traditions and history of this Indian tribe. Rangers give talks and demonstrations during the summer months at 11:00, 1:00, and at 3:00 each day. Movies are also shown at the Museum, and there are many pictures and art, too. It is open year around, except on the major holidays. The Nez Perce Indians rode horses, seasonally caught and lived on salmon, and also hunted buffalo. Because of the changing food supply, they were largely migratory. They were powerful, and were finally forced onto reservations after a number of battles which started in the spring of 1877. Today, visitors can follow the Nez Perce National Historical Trail and see many of the sites. Some of the battlegrounds can also be seen, such as the White Bird Battlefield, which was the first battle. Another major battle, which was a major blow to the Indians, was the surprise attack by the US troops at the Big Hole National Battlefield on August 9, 1877. From there, the remaining Nez Perce Indians, about 800, fled north toward Canada. They were stopped just 40 miles south of Canada by the Army, and Chief Joseph surrendered on October 5, 1877. Today, the remaining Nez Perce Indians live on nearby reservations where their traditions are kept alive. When it comes to other activities that visitors can do in the area, there is almost no limit. There are many places within easy driving distances that provide sport opportunities for rafting and kayaking, biking, rock climbing, horseback riding, hang-gliding, ballooning, hunting and fishing, and much more. There are also many places to see, too, such as museums, guided tours, wildlife viewing - and much more."
"North End Neighborhood","Idaho","North End Neighborhood, Boise, Idaho","Lewis and Clark were instrumental throughout the United States in discovering new territories. These two men hiked over the great divide to explore more of the western states. It was their expedition that found the Boise River Valley. The French who also came to the area were enamored with the numerous trees, so they called out Les Bois'' which means The Trees.'' Thus it was decided to name the city Boise. The French were imperative in fur trading with the Native Americans. A Fort was even built in Boise. In the beginning Boise was 40 miles in size with the Boise River and Snake River as the Borders. It was during the 1820's that Lewis and Clark first set eyes on the area. The North End is a neighborhood in Boise. It dates back to the 1890's. It was originally a remote section of the city until the 1950's, when it quickly started growing as a residential area. For most of the 20th century individuals built homes in the area, which now offers an amazing array of architecture. Some of the homes are stately, while others are Spanish in style. Many of these homes are part of the National Register of Historic Places. During the 1960's the neighborhood grew even more with apartments and Queen Anne style homes. Today the North End is a place for tourists to explore. Sightseeing down the main boulevard, shopping, or spending time in the park are activities most popular to the neighborhood. It is known for its history, beauty, and trees. Flowers and gardens line the streets, as do a dozen parks. It is the gateway to the Boise Foothills and Bogus Basin area. Hyde Park is also the most well known place for a picnic and afternoon of fun with the family. Hyde Park is a national historical site due to the buildings and architecture of the area, as well as the age of the community. As a headquarters for activity festivals are offered throughout the year. Bike tours begin on the streets of Hyde Park, and it is a place for community activity. Kids tend to gather in the area after school with music on the weekends during the summer, and plenty of restaurants can be found. The restaurants are Italian, Spanish, American, and other international cuisines. In the 1980's there was a bit of a challenge with upgrading North 13th Street. The property owners wanted to be able to keep the original architecture of the buildings. They didn't want to change the character of the neighborhood, and insisted new places follow the property guidelines. Property values of the area are growing rather quickly, making it the place to be in Boise. Harrison Boulevard is the main street in the North End Neighborhood. There are lamp stands at every intersection, with the park in the center. The street has numerous homes from several periods. McAuley Park is the anchor at the south end, with Hill Road to the North with Harrison Hollow."
"Old Fort Boise","Idaho","Old Fort Boise, Parma, Idaho","There are two forts that were built in Idaho. The first is called the Old Fort Boise, while the other is referred to as the New Fort Boise. Still, both were built in the 19th century. The Old Fort Boise is located in Parma, Idaho. The new fort was built on the site that is now Boise, which is fifty miles to the east of the original structure. Old Fort Boise was created by the Hudson Bay Company as a trading post along the Snake River. Residents and travelers were able to stop at the post before moving on to Oregon. Idaho was part of the fur company's Columbia District at the time. Unfortunately the fort underwent a lot of damage so it had to be rebuilt many times. The Old Fort Boise was first built in 1834, and abandoned in 1855. It is thought that the Astor Expedition was the first whites to venture as far west as the Idaho/ Oregon border. They were searching for the best place to put a fur trading post in 1811. It would take 23 more years before the trading post would actually be built though. John Reid was part of the expedition and belonged to the Pacific Fur Company traders. He helped establish an outpost at the mouth of the River Boise in 1813. Once the fort was built a man by the name of Colin Traver spent several stops there. He was a famous explorer along the Oregon Trail. He helped defend the area from Native American attacks and other issues that occurred. However, the men at the fort during this time were killed by the Native Americans. Two children at the fort were able to escape 200 miles in the snow to reach the Walla Walla Indians on the Columbia River. Thomas McKay holds the credit for building the first Fort Boise. He was a veteran leader of the HBC Snake Country Brigades. He chose the same spot Reid and MacKenzie used in earlier years to build a small trading post. The HBC was in charge of the fort until 1844 when it was abandoned. At the time French Canadian Francois Payette was running the fort. He even had to rebuild the fort in 1838. So he chose a location five miles from the original place at the mouths of the Boise and Snake River. This is northwest of the town Parma Idaho and south of Nyssa Oregon. While Old Fort Boise is just ruins today, there is still a great deal of historical significance that makes it a site for tourists to see. There is a replica of Fort Boise on the site along with a concrete marker to show where the site used to be. For the adventurer there are trails near the Old Fort Boise that one can hike to get more historical information. The trails like the Oregon Trail, Lander Road, and Goodale's Cutoff were all used by pioneers and fur traders to reach the west."
"Old Idaho Penitentiary","Idaho","Old Idaho Penitentiary, Boise, Idaho","In 1870 the Territory of Idaho decided to build a prison. The territory had been established for less than ten years at that time. However, those in the town decided they needed some place to keep convicts. They originally called it the Idaho Territorial Prison, but it is now the Old Idaho State Penitentiary. The building lies east of the city of Boise. At the beginning the penitentiary was a single cell house built out of sandstone. The stone was quarried from ridges nearby the penitentiary. The resident convicts actually mined the rock. They also helped build all later construction. The Old State Penitentiary sits on 5100 acres, with a total of 15 buildings. Architectural style is Romanesque. With over a hundred and three years of operation the prison saw 13,000 convicts. At any given time a maximum population was six hundred. Two hundred and fifteen of these convicts were actually women. In the 1970's there were two very serious riots. The first broke out in 1971, the second in 1973. The riots were both over living conditions inside the prison. To make the convicts a bit more comfortable 416 residents were moved to a new facility in the south section of Boise. Eventually on December 3, 1973 the Old Idaho Penitentiary was closed. When the prison closed, the National Historical Society named it a place of historical significance. The historical society wanted to add more records to the history of the penitentiary. To do this they interviewed fifteen prison guards that worked at the site. They have tapes and transcripts from these conversations. The information recorded has to do with the operations and what these guards could remember of the 1950's. Anyone wishing to do research can listen to this collection. At the site there is a museum and an arboretum. The museum depicts some of the historical artifacts kept at the prison. These artifacts include prison uniforms, utensils, and other things inmates might have had. It is possible to tour the Old Idaho State Penitentiary. In 1999 JC Denton, a weapons collector donated his collection to the state. They put this collection at one of the museums on the prison property. These weapons range from the Bronze Age to those of today. Sport, law enforcement, and military weapons make up the collection. A most important part of the collection is the pieces from the Luristan Bronze age. They date to 3500 B.C. The Old State Penitentiary is open year round from noon to 5pm. They do close for holidays. Summer hours have the museums and prison open from 10am to 5pm. Admission is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors, and $3 for children 6 to 12. They allow for groups to come to the prison. Students living in Boise often go on field trips to the Old Idaho State Penitentiary to learn about local history. Boise is one of the largest cities in Idaho. It is a center for financial businesses, industrial companies, and a tourist center."
"Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History","Idaho","Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History, Caldwell, Idaho","The Orma J. Smith Museum of Natural History belongs to the College of Idaho. It is located in the southwest portion of the state bordering southeast Oregon and Northern Nevada. The museum was built to help support the college, provide a resource of information for the community, and perform scientific research. Natural history specimens are used to teach students about the animals and practices used to protect the specimens. All displays are open to the public, though school days are by appointment only. The collections house animals and plants. Volunteers are able to work at the museum and there is a library for research open to the public. The collections have been used by national and international experts for a number of research projects. Sometimes the specimens are given on lone to other museums or institutions. The collection is one of permanent record for biodiversity around the world. Since the museum is tied to the college they are only open when classes are in session. Entry to the museum is through Boone Hall at the first level. College programs include a number of college courses, museum workdays, taxonomic and ecological studies, the Great Basin Chapter studies of archeology, and expeditions to other states and countries. The college will send students to Australia, Baja CA, and other western states for their education. Specifically the collections are entomology, fish, and anthropology exhibits. Under the entomology collection are numerous insects that have been found around the world. Individuals can learn about these insects, why they are important to the world, and how they can help in other fields. The fish collection is a partial donation from Richard L. Wallace. The collection has numerous species from Idaho and other locations. The anthropology collection is all about cultures of North America. The Luther Douglas Navajo Ceremonial Sandpaintings Collection is one of the largest in the world. The other two collections are the Gates- Lewis Native American Collection and the Meldrum New Guinea Collection. This collection houses baskets, jewelry, and other artifacts of the New Guinea cultures. There is even a god statue in the collection. Orma J. Smith's Museum is not the only place the college has collections. They also have artifacts at Tucker Herbarium, Evans Gem and Mineral Collection, and the Whittenberger Planetarium. The four museums and buildings give a comprehensive look at the past. To get residents interested in the museum, as well as tourists, there are events held each year. For example the Boise Front 4th of July Butterfly Count, BioBlitz, Friday Escape to the Museum'', Bug Day, and other museum days are held each year. The museum employs over 20 different experts to work as curators, directors, and research associates at the museum. An interesting tool at the museum is the Corbiculacea of North America. It is a graphic key to the Musculium, Sphaerium, and Pisidium genera. The images on the poster are an outline which was created by Dr. Gerald L. Mackie at the University of Guelph."
"Osprey Meadows at Tamarack Resort","Idaho","Osprey Meadows at Tamarack Resort, Donnelly, Idaho - One of the Finest Golf Courses in the Pacific Northwest","Osprey Meadows Golf Course is nestled amid ponderosa pine forests and high meadows near Idaho's sprawling Frank Church Wilderness. According to course designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr., the natural terrain provided a perfect design palette - but it also provided a bit of a challenge. Namely, the course layout carried it over two distinctive terrains, and the challenge was to seamlessly weave the design over the two. The first terrain consists of lakes, streams, wetlands, meadows of wildflowers, and aspen groves. The second terrain consists of higher ground populated by ponderosa pine trees. The result is a golf course, according to Jones, with ...dramatic changes in landscape, and majestic views of the mountains, the meadow and Lake Cascade, [which] qualify Osprey Meadows as one of the finest courses in the Pacific Northwest.'' To accomplish the feat, Jones incorporated design features such as split fairways, doglegs, wetland cross hazards, bridges and boardwalks, dramatic waterfalls, and the occasional island-style green and fairways. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,319 yards from the tips and is considered strategically complex, but generous landing areas lessen the difficulty. The course also features 69 bunkers, while the greens average a generous 7,000 square feet. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course are its par-5s. Hole No. 4, for example, is a long hole at 608 yards from the tips. Adding to the uniqueness and the difficulty, the hole moves downhill to the right with a fairway split by a stream that runs the length of the hole, as well as wildflowers and then bunkers in the landing area. The par-5 No. 18 is similar, playing uphill and doglegging to the right. At 547 yards from the longest tees, it's not an especially long hole, but features island fairways and bands of wetlands that serve as hazards. This last hole is also a tribute to St. Andrews, as No. 18 at Osprey Meadows is situated beside the resort village and passersby can watch golfers finishing their round, just as they do at the legendary old course. It's exactly that type of hole that golfers will find at Osprey Meadows, which Travel & Leisure Golf magazine said features playful, often deceptive holes.''  The course, which opened in 2005, has also received numerous awards and accolades, such as: Best New Golf Course,'' by Men's Journal, 2007; one of the Top 50 Best New Golf Courses'' by Golfweek, 2007; and a ranking at #79 among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play'' by GOLF Magazine, 2008. The course also features practice facilities, and golf lessons are available at Osprey Meadows Golf Academy. In addition to golf, there are a number of summer and winter activities available at the resort. Biking, hiking, boating, rafting, fishing and zipline tours are some of the possibilities in the warmer months. In the winter, the course transforms into a ski resort for Alpine and Nordic skiing and snowshoeing. Other amenities can be found in the resort's Tamarack Village, including a collection of retail shopping and dining options. Restaurants include Morels for intimate, gourmet dining, as well as the Terrace Bar & Grill, Canoe Grill and Seven Devils Pub for more casual fare and drinks."

The river stretches from British Columbia through Washington State and Oregon before it dumps into the Pacific Ocean. The Pend Oreille is 130 miles in length. It runs from northern Idaho to northeast Washington State. The Pend also runs through south east British Columbia. When it is written in British Columbia it is spelled Pend d'Oreille River. The river drains into the Rocky Mountains. Occasionally the lower part of the river is referred to as Clark Fork, especially in Montana. Testing on the river shows it drains 66,800 square kilometers through the Clark Fork and tributaries in Montana like Flathead River. The full drainage basin and the tributaries provide forty three percent of the water that is in the Columbia River Basin. Lake Pend Oreilla is the beginning site for the river of the same name. The lake is in Bonner County in the Idaho panhandle. The water drains from the lake running to the west towards Sandpoint. Clark Fork enters the lake from the eastern side. The water flowing into the river also comes from the Priest River, which is to the north in Priest River Town. The water will then flow to the south towards Pend Oreille County into north eastern Washington at Newport. In Washington the water flows to the eastern side of the Selkirk Mountains. Here the water is going to run parallel with the Idaho border for fifty miles before flowing through the Colville National Forest, Tiger and Metaline Falls. It will cross the British Columbia border for fifteen miles before going into the Columbia River. The Pend Oreille River has five dams along the way. These dams are Waneta, Seven Mile (which has two dams in Canada), Box Canyon, and Albeni Falls. Any fish in the river are not able to get past the dams. The Pend Oreille River provides plenty of activities along the way for visitors. It is also a wonderful drive to make. While the roads will not always be close to the river there are points of interest where photographers can get some great shots. Since the river comes from the lake river rafting trips are available. It is also possible to take a kayak down the river. Some fishing is available. However, the fishing is better at the lake where the fish tend to congregate. Rainbow trout is the most prolific species of the lake and river. The waters can grow quite cold during the winter months, but during summer they can be all right to wade in for fishing. If a visitor is closer to the lake at the river there will be plenty of attractions and restaurants. It is possible to rent a hotel room or vacation home for the summer to enjoy the river and lake in Idaho."
"Pomerelle Mountain Resort","Idaho","Pomerelle Mountain Resort, Albion, ID","The Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho is home to a beautiful resort that has activities in the winter and the summer. The Pomerelle Mountain Resort is at an elevation of 8,000 feet and is close to the small town of Albion, Idaho. There are not many cities in this area called the Magic Valley. In 1893 Albion started a school that trained the teachers for the state of Idaho. It was called the Albion State Normal School. This school remained open until 1951 when the teaching classes were moved to Idaho State College. The name has been changed to the Idaho State University now and it is in Pocatello, Idaho. There was a bank that was founded in 1904 by D.L. Evans. The branch bank still is in Albion, but the main facility is now in Burley, Idaho. The Pomerelle Mountain Resort is in the southern part of Idaho and is especially suited to families. They enjoy teaching the little children to ski and snowboard. There are twenty four slopes with one triple chair lift and one double chair lift. A 450'' Magic Carpet boardwalk lift has been recently installed at the mountain resort. The ski resort has a vertical drop of approximately one thousand feet. The terrain of the Pomerelle Mountain Resort is varied with many gladed areas. Because of this terrain it is great for both snowboarders and skiers. Cross country skiers can take advantage of the Nordic loops that are adjacent to the resort. These loops take skiers within the United States Forest Service land as well. The resort offers group and private lessons. They start at 10:30 am and at 1:30 pm for the group lessons. Skiers who want a private lesson can schedule them for their convenience. The group lessons run for about an hour and a half. They divide the groups into age and the ability of the skiers. The classes are generally no larger than ten students at one time. Guests that wish to take a ski lesson with ski rentals can purchase them at the rental shop only. Guests that just need the ski lessons can purchase them at the Pomerelle ticket office for ages seven and up. Lift passes will be needed as well. The rates are between thirty to forty five dollars.

"Qwest Arena","Idaho","Qwest Arena, Boise, Idaho","Qwest is primarily a company of the north east providing telephone, internet, and television to residents. In 1997 the company lent its name to an arena in Boise Idaho. The Qwest Arena was first known as the Bank of America Center. It can hold 5,300 people for hockey and 5,732 people for end stage concerts. Center stage concerts will hold the most people at 6,800. There are 4,508 permanent seats, but with center stage seating they place folding chairs on the floor to increase the amount of seats. The Qwest Arena was built with $50 million, making it one of the smaller arenas in the United States. The Qwest Arena is home to the Idaho Steelheads ECHL hockey team. It is also the home for the Stampede D- League Basketball team and the Boise Burn Arena Football Team. Among the seats are 39 corporate suites with 1,100 club premiere seats.

"Ridgecrest Golf Course","Idaho","Ridgecrest Golf Course, Nampa, Idaho - A Links-Style Golf Course with Vast Areas of Water and Down-Home Idaho Warmth","Ridgecrest Golf Course is an 18-hole championship course designed by John Harbottle that opened in 1996. Set amid Idaho's rolling corn fields, with views of the rugged Owhyee Mountains and the Boise Range visible, Ridgecrest is a Bermuda-grass, links-style course with vast areas of water to add to the challenge. The course, which was given a 4-Star rating by Golf Digest magazine, has been described as having an authentic Idaho feel,'' combining stunning views with the down-home warmth of Idaho farm country. Seven of its 18 holes are considered water holes,'' while four waste bunkers and 30 traditional bunkers - some of them massive and running the length of the fairway on many holes - are sprinkled throughout the course. There's also a ridge that divides the 18 holes and adds to the setting and the challenge. The course plays to 6,836 at its longest, with a USGA course rating of 72 and a slope rating of 125. One of the more noteworthy holes is No. 12, a par-3 that plays to 227 yards at its longest. The hole features a drop of 200 feet from the tee to a green guarded by bunkers on the front and water on the right. Another noteworthy hole is No. 17, a par-4 that plays to 417 yards from the back tees. This is the #1-handicap hole on the course, and requires a long, straight drive into the fairway, followed by an accurate approach shot up a large hill to reach the narrow green at the summit. Adding to the challenge are the two bunkers that guard the front and back of the green. In general, the back nine, including holes 13 through 16, are considered some of the most interesting and challenging as water comes into play on each of those holes. Hole No. 15 is an interesting par-4, playing to only 261 yards from the back tees - definitely reachable in one, but requiring a forced carry over a pond to do so. Practice facilities include a driving range, a putting-chipping area and practice bunker. The club also features a nine-hole, par-32 Executive Course that can stretch to almost 2,400. Lessons are also available, and the club features a Pro Shop with club rental available. Ridgecrest Golf Club also boasts a large clubhouse with locker rooms, snack bar, cocktails, restaurant and banquet facilities."

"Sawtooth National Forest","Idaho","Sawtooth National Forest, Twin Falls, ID","This area of Idaho was not considered to be very friendly for human inhabitants so it wasn't developed until the late 1800's. Although Native Americans such as the Northern Shoshone and Banncock did live in this area the Europeans came through and didn't stay. This area of land became part of the Oregon Trail after Robert Stuart was successful in leading an expedition from Astoria, Oregon to St. Louis, Missouri. Many acts of Congress had to be passed before the Sawtooth National Forest was actually protected. Although Congress tried to pass acts as early as 1799 it wasn't until much later that the preservation of the forests was really instituted. President Theodore Roosevelt created the Sawtooth National Forest in May of 1905, preserving 1,947,520 acres. The Sawtooth National Forest has many activities for visitors to enjoy. Some of the areas are very primitive while others have recreation sites with campgrounds and lakes. Because of the heritage of this area there are almost fifteen hundred heritage sites in this forest. Preservation of this heritage is one of the reasons the forest is here so there are teaching and interpretive talks about the archaeology of the forest. School children can come to the forest on field trips and visitors can learn about the forest when they tour it. There are three types of fees charges for using the Sawtooth National Forest. There is an entrance fee for using the designated federal recreation areas. The second type is a Use fees. This includes visitor areas such as campgrounds, swimming areas, boat launches and parking. It can also include water fowl blinds, specialized interpretive services, or cave tours. The third fee is for Special Recreation Permit Fees. These specialized fees would be for a group activity permit, recreational events, and using motorized vehicles in the federal recreation areas. An Interagency Annual Pass costs eighty dollars and is good for one year from the date of purchase. It will allow entrance to the following: national parks, national wildlife refuges, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife, Bureau of Reclamation, National Park Service and Bureau of Land Managementsites that charge fees. This pass only covers the entrance fee. There is an Interagency Senior Pass that gets visitors over 62 into the same recreational areas. It is good for the lifetime of the purchaser and costs ten dollars. This pass also gives a fifty percent discount on federal recreation use fees for most facilities and services. It does exclude concessions and special recreation permits. An Interagency Access Pass for blind and permanently disabled citizens is available for free and lasts a lifetime. It has the same benefits as the Senior Pass. There are permits that are needed for firewood. Citizens can take two cords of wood from the forest for twenty five dollarswith a maximum of ten cords per year. Christmas Trees can be cut from the forest with a permit. It costs five dollars for a single tree no taller than eight feet and ten dollars for a tree that is larger than eight feet."
"Sawtooth Wilderness Area","Idaho","Sawtooth Wilderness Area, Ketchum, Idaho","Ketchum is a small town in Idaho, with a little over 3000 residents. The Sawtooth Wilderness Area is located just outside of Ketchum. In 1972 congress offered 217,000 acres of land to Idaho for the wilderness area. It is managed by the US forest service. Sawtooth Mountains are considered beautiful, with a wild quality that is hard to find. From the wilderness area one can view the mountain peaks rising above the flat lands and over lakes and streams. There are hundreds of peaks in the wilderness area. 42 of them are over 10,000 feet above sea level. Hundreds of alpine lakes and basins await hikers. The protection of the park area has helped keep the wildlife safe. Visitors can see eagles, other birds, chipmunks, and other small critters when walking along the groomed nature trails. Travelers to the Sawtooth Wilderness Area can go trout fishing, mountain climbing, hunting, hiking, and camping during the year. There are 42 wilderness trails that cover a total of 270 miles. Open fires are not allowed in the park, to help minimize human impact on the land as well as prevent wildfires. Temperatures can drop below freezing during the winter months, and even during the fall and spring. The summer months are known for their heat and mosquitoes. There are certain laws of Sawtooth Wilderness that must be adhered to. As public land one is only temporarily able to stay on the land. The camping areas are designated and require payment. For hunting on the area one must have a permit and only hunt what the permit allows. Before hiking or going on the trails visitors should pick up a trail map. The map will show each trail head, the distance the trail takes, and whether or not it is a loop. This will help the visitors to choose the trail most suited to their skills. Anyone hiking should be with a buddy. Climbers should go in groups of two or more. They also should register with the state park employees to ensure they can be found in the event of an accident. Dogs are allowed in certain areas of Sawtooth Wilderness Park. Dogs are required to be on leashes and to be picked up after. The park will state if there are any closures, restrictions, or fees that apply to a person's visit in the park. Like most state parks there are areas that can be driven to outside the park to make the trails accessible. However, these areas are not plentiful as the park motto is to leave no footprints behind. Inside the wilderness area any mechanical equipment, bicycles, or motorized rides are not allowed. The camping and fishing options are by permit only. No buildings or roads are found within the 217,000 acres. This means facilities are not going to be available. Logging and mining is also not allowed on the land, leaving it fairly untouched since 1964 when the wilderness act was passed. A few wildfires have affected the area, but that was minimal."

"St. John's Cathedral","Idaho","St. John's Cathedral, Boise, Idaho","Bishop Alphonse Glorieux began work on St. John's Cathedral in 1906. He arrived in Boise from St. Michael's College in Portland Oregon in 1883. At the time they had 1500 parishioners and 7000 Catholics. Already in Boise there were 27 churches, and 10 secular priests. Four schools, an academy, and two hospitals were being formed in the 1890's. The amount of churchgoers in Boise was growing so quickly that the churches could no longer hold them. The Bishop decided they needed a larger building so that all could attend. In 1906 they began construction at 9th and Bannock Streets for a full block building. The cathedral was built in stages though. Recognizing that the cost for such a massive building would be quite a lot, the Bishop had the people work on it as they had the money. Finally in 1912 the walls and roof were finished. Since the church was still not completed the parishioners had their services in the basement. Bishop Gorman took over the finishing of the church which occurred in 1921. The architecture of the church is Romanesque. Tourtellotte and Hummel was the architectural firm. The firm wanted to have a German Cathedral akin to the one of Mainz. The design was a cruciform with a long place for parishioners to sit, and then two wings towards the front of the church. It has 170 feet from front to back, and 95 feet across. The sandstone used to build the walls was taken from the Table Rock Quarry. The main entrance has two corner towers with large stain glass windows. The towers were designed to have spires on top, with another spire further along the roof near the nave. Arches were built in much detail, and corbels crosses were added. Inside the cathedral is just as beautifully crafted as the outside. The style is both classical and baroque. Plaster walls with acoustical canvas and plaster ceilings for paintings are on the inside. The stain glass windows from the inside depict the life of Christ. There is a choir loft with organ. Some restoration efforts had to be made in the later 1900's as age began to wear it down. Still, the building is almost like new. In 1981 the Idaho Historic Preservation Council gave the Orchid Award for the restorations and labeled it a National Historic Site. Anyone can visit the cathedral during the day. When a service is being performed the church is closed to tourists. However, for those of the Catholic religion they can attend the services. The church is a community locale for children and adults. There are programs for further education, communion, and even marriage counseling. Residents are able to contact the church to arrange services they may need like baptism, weddings, or funerals. The cathedral offers Spanish mass on Sundays. Each Sunday there is more than one mass, to make it easier for individuals to attend. They also have mass on Saturday evenings, and Wednesdays. A calendar of events also depicts the special services offered during the year."
"St. Michael's Episcopal Cathedral","Idaho","St. Michael's Episcopal Cathedral, Boise, Idaho","In 2002 St Michael's Cathedral reached 100 years of age. The construction of the building is the English Gothic with sandstone materials used from Table Rock. When the cathedral was first opened Reverend Charles Deuel and Bishop James Funsten were head of the church. A crowd of 500 people attended the opening, and several more were turned away because of the lack of space. St. Michael's was important to the development of the Episcopal faith. The first service ever held in Boise was in 1864. During the years to come collections were made so that a church could be created. This church is the Christ Chapel near the Boise State University Campus. It was not a large enough church to fulfil the needs of the congregation, which is why years later the cathedral was built. From its very beginnings the cathedral has offered music, concerts, dances, and social events to help get the community interested. It was also to help stop gunfights in the streets from the young miners. At the time the cathedral was being built a hospital near the church was also being constructed. Education was offered at the church as well. The architecture is gothic, so there are church spires standing tall, with stain glass windows at important points. A frame style roofs and a square tower make up the appearance of the cathedral. In 1919 music week at the cathedral was started, which is a tradition that is still held today with traditional organ concerts. Other events held today include lunches with homemade clam chowder and pies. To earn money for the congregation and church a thrift shop was placed inside the church. Those who need a helping hand in the community can visit the shop, and those who can are able to donate. The thrift shop has more than clothing, and they have a food cupboard with sack lunches for anyone who is in need. St. Michael's Cathedral offers services on Saturday at 5:30pm, Sunday 8am, 9:15am, and 11 am, Tuesday 12:15pm, and Thursday 7:30am. During the summer they have an 8am and 10am mass, with a nursery available for small children. As with any church there are other services offered besides the regular mass. The cathedral offers funeral services, weddings, baptisms, and communions. Every Wednesday St. Michael's has Cathedral Night. This evening is a dinner for parish families. The meal begins at 6pm for $6 for adults and children over ten. Donations are welcome for those under ten. The children also have choir practice, a childcare facility, and adult classes are available. As an important part of the community there are a number of programs to encourage members of the community to get involved. Children have after school programs so that they do not have to go home to be alone till their parents get off of work. They are able to interact in a safe environment. Adult classes are on a variety of topics and studies to help further their education."
"Sun Valley Resort Golf Course","Idaho","Sun Valley Resort Golf Course, Sun Valley, Idaho - A Grand Old Resort Golf Course","At one point, Golf Digest rated the 18-hole Trail Creek Golf Course at Sun Valley Resort as the No. 1 course in Idaho, and continues to rate it among the 100 Best Golf Courses in the United States. New Idaho courses, such as Circling Raven and Osprey Meadows provide competition for that state title, but the Trail Creek Golf Course is still a grand old resort course, and a graceful, rugged and stunning place to play. Golf-course designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr. updated the original Sun Valley course in the late 1970s, making use of the beautiful creek-side land at the bottom of the ski slopes. Jones then completed his redesign in 1980, incorporating a full complement of carries over Trail Creek - seven times on the front nine alone - and intimidating bunkers to the mix. The result is the Trail Creek Course, a par-72 layout that plays to 6,892 yards from the tips, and features narrow fairways, lakes and mature pine trees. The course is said to have 18 signature holes,'' which is a tribute to its beauty and challenge. The course has a USGA rating is 72.5 with a slope rating of 141 at its longest. In 2008, Sun Valley Resort added nine new holes called the White Clouds Course, and plans are in the works for another nine. The White Clouds Course is a links-style design that reaches dramatically into the mountains, from one plateau to another. There are few trees, but numerous bunkers to add to the challenge. The White Clouds nine plays to 3,600 yards from the longest tees, and has been given a USGA rating of 76.6 and a slope rating of 143. For women, the ratings are even tougher at 80.6 and 146 respectively. Practice facilities at Sun Valley Resort include a 12-acre driving range with 52,000 square feet of teeing area and four green and bunker target areas. There's also a 20,000-square-foot pitching, chipping and bunker practice area, a 6,300-square-foot putting green, as well as the Sawtooths Putting Course - an 18-hole practice putting course. Lessons are also available from the Sun Valley Resort staff of PGA teaching professionals. Along with the new nine-hole White Clouds Course, the resort unveiled a new, 58,000-square-foot clubhouse in 2008 that serves both golf courses and doubles as a Nordic ski center in the winter. The clubhouse features a number of amenities, including a pro shop, indoor driving range and restaurant. As a bit of history, Sun Valley was the first ski resort in America, opening in 1936, and is said to be where the chairlift was invented. One still remains near the back nine of the Trail Creek Golf Course as a monument to the resort's history. In addition to golf, the resort offers a tennis center with 17 courts, three swimming pools, two fitness centers, along with activities such hiking and biking on 28 miles of trails, fishing and rafting. There's also an ice rink that's open year-round, and the resort ranks as one of the best for winter skiing."

It took a year for him to find the area, and a few times he felt defeated according to written history. He heard about Ketchum, a mining town in Idaho. It was then that he finally found the home for the ski resort to mirror that of his home land. He called it a near example of Switzerland, Austria. He purchased 4,300 acres to build the resort on. Sun Valley Resort has the distinction of seeing numerous Hollywood stars over the years. Clark Gable, Claudete Colbert, Bing Crosby, Gary Cooper, and Errol Flynn were regulars at the resort.

"Thousand Springs Scenic Highway","Idaho","Thousand Springs Scenic Highway, Bliss, Idaho","The Thousand Springs Scenic Highway begins in Bliss, Idaho. It is referred to as a byway, rather than a highway by most individuals, because it is a secondary way to get from one destination to another. It is the more scenic route to take. The Thousand Springs Scenic Highway is on US 30 between Hagerman and Twin Falls. When driving along the byway it is easy to see how this scenic road obtained its name. There are numerous natural springs which flow from steep canyon walls down to the Snake River. The highway takes you along the Snake River Canyon. It is said to be one of the most beautiful drives in the United States. The water source of these springs comes from the Snake River Plains Aquifer. It is one of the largest groundwater devices, not only in the US, but in the world. The water actually seeps through volcanic rock, which is very porous. The water moves over thousands of square miles in this southern region. Eventually the water flows out of the cliffs. Unfortunately, much of the water is diverted by hydroelectric projects. This means some of the springs are not as plentiful with water as in the past, and some springs are dry. Travelers will not count a thousand springs; however, the byway is still a very impressive and majestic sight. Along the highway it is possible to follow a portion of the Oregon Trail. The Oregon National Historic Trail was the main route for westward movement for many pioneers. The Payette River and Thousand Springs Scenic Byways both follow a portion of the trail. There will be points on the highway for travelers to stop and take photos. There are also little jaunts off the road where one can hike a little ways. On Thousand Springs Scenic Byway visitors can reach Shoshone Falls. At this location travelers are able to take guided boat tours along the river to see many of the springs. It is possible to get so close to the springs that visitors will feel the spray in their faces. There are fees for the boat trips and some of the other attractions. However, if visitors want to walk along the paths to view the scenic river there is no fee. There are a number of hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding trails along the scenic highway, especially at Malad Gorge Park. It will take travelers along the edge of the river. Camping is allowed at certain intervals along the scenic byway for those who are interested. Since the road is a byway there are food, gasoline, and lodging options. There are also some shopping places. Tourists who wish to remember their trip can buy souvenirs along the way. The Thousand Springs Scenic Byway was designated such by the government. Congress designated a few roads in the United States as scenic byways. There are a few of these byways in Idaho besides the Thousand Springs Scenic Byway for tourists to travel."

Coeur d'Alene Idaho is a medium sized city with over 30,000 residents living there year round. Visitors to this region have the option of taking hikes up the Tubbs Hill Nature Trails. The trails were named for Tony A. Tubbs. He was an immigrant from Germany who came to the Coeur d'Alene region in 1882. Tubbs became the first Justice of the Peace and built the first hotel of the city. Publicly he owned 135 acres of land. During his life he left most of the land untouched, allowing it to be accessible only on foot. Later on Coeur d'Alene city bought acres from the Tubbs family in four purchases. The first purchase was for 33 acres in 1936. Eventually by 1977 the city had bought four plots of land of 33 and 34 acres. The acres bought were incorporated into a state park system, with Tubbs Hill being the main focus. The most popular trail on the Tubbs Hill Nature Trails map is a two mile loop. The two mile loop takes hikers up the hill around to some of the best scenic viewpoints, woodland habitats, and historical focal points. There are markers throughout the trail that will help visitors learn about the flora and fauna of the area. The trail head begins at the parking lot between McEuen Park and Coeur d'Alene Resort. The trail markers are 8 inches by 10 inches and posted about 8 feet above the ground. At the beginning of the trail is a map and informational brochure that offers information corresponding to these markers. The information could be about the scenic view, the tree type, an animal that hangs around the area, or anything else. Anyone going on the hiking loop should plan for at least two hours. Visitors should wear comfortable shoes, bring plenty of drinking water, and perhaps a camera. Visitors can also bring food for a picnic to certain areas, but they should be aware of the local animals and keep the food in appropriate containers. Some areas of the trail will be rocky and steep. Visitors are allowed to bring their leashed dogs to the trail as long as they bring along the scooper bags. Any visitor to the park trails should be hiking with a buddy, stay off the trails at night, and avoid wearing headphones in order to stay fully aware. No hiker should step off the designated trail, especially in areas that are rocky and steep. Safety is the hiker's responsibility and using proper caution is important. Tubbs Hill overlooks Lake Coeur d'Alene. Boaters can bring their crafts to a small sandy stretch to hike the trails of the park.

General admission is $8, Seniors are $6, Military personnel $6, and kids 5 to 12 are $4. Holiday closures do exist, so tourists should check with the museum before driving to the location on Municipal Drive. Schools are able to tour the facility for education purposes, and there are programs offered. Museum tours for regular residents and visitors are also available. These tours are self guided or with docents. Self guided tours allow folks to walk around with headsets offering facts about the exhibits. Docent tours are no extra charge, but do require prior arrangement. The museum has a host of volunteers, many of them veterans of wars. Some of these individuals have told stories of their time in war, which has lent more history to the exhibits. For example the Veteran's History Project is a collection of stories about men and women in World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf Wars. Documents are part of the exhibits, as are the uniforms men and women had to wear. These stories come from all branches of the military including the reserves, merchant marines, and others. Each year the museum has events they host. These events can differ from year to year, but others do remain the same. The Kilroy Coffee Klatch occurs every first Tuesday of the month. It is for people to have conversations about their times in war or what they remember from childhood. The conversations begin at 10 am. A Salute to North American Aviation is hosted in July. This event is about the technological achievements which have been made in the world and in North America. For example technology was helpful in WWII for Air raids and helping the troops survive. There are four models of the P-51 Mustangs which are on display for the event and all year round. In 2009 Col Bud Anderson was the speaker at this event. A veterans Breakfast is hosted with pancakes, eggs, hash browns, and beverages. The breakfast is to honor those who have served with entertainment, and the Top Fun Flyers. This breakfast is hosted in November. There is also a Pearl Harbor Day in December. Men and women can come from all over to talk about their experiences and meet others. It is also a time for reunions. The exhibits are mostly planes, but uniforms, stories, pictures, and a few automobiles are on display as well."
"Whitetail Golf Club","Idaho","Whitetail Golf Club, McCall, Idaho ? One of Idaho's Finest Golf Courses with a ``Feel-Good'' Demeanor","The Whitetail Golf Club is an 18-hole Andy North-Roger B. Packard-designed championship course that opened in 2002. The course typifies Idaho golf and features old-growth forests, sweaping, open meadows, Ponderosa Pines, trout ponds, fields of vibrant wildflowers, and imposing bolders, all nestled beneath the serenity of Idaho's mountain peaks. The course is carved out of and through a dense forest, and features lush, crosscut Blue Grass fairways,white-sand bunkers and long, rolling greens. The par-72 course plays to 7,013 yards at its longest, with a USGA course rating of 71.4 and a slope rating of 125. The course is considered a bit more forgiving than other nearby courses, with flatter putting surfaces and more of a feel-good'' demeanor. One of the more noteworthy holes is the par-5 4th, which plays to 548 yards form the back tees. The hole plays uphill to an undulating fairway landing area that slopes to the left on drives that miss the mark. A large pond guards the approach to the green on the right, and a number of bunkers guard the front and right side of the green. Another noteworthy and challenging hole is the par-5 15th. The hole plays to 540 yards from the back tees, and a severe dogleg right off the tee plays around a water hazard that runs the length of the hole and past the green. The fairway narrows to a bottleneck just before a green guarded by two front bunkers, trees on the left and water on the right. The Whitetail Golf Club has received several honors and awards, including being named one of the Top 100 Courses in America'' by Golfweek Magazine in 2009. Golf Digest also ranks it among America's 100 Greatest Courses.'' The course features expansive practice facilities, and lessons are also available from a PGA Professional instructor.

"World Center for Birds of Prey","Idaho","World Center for Birds of Prey, Boise, Idaho","Education to Idahoans is important. For this reason they have numerous museums and historical sites in the city. One attraction for visitors and residents of Boise is the World Center for Birds of Prey. Boise is the capital of Idaho, which makes it imperative to offer a place devoted to conservation of animals, plants, and cultures. The World Center for Birds of Prey is the Peregrine Fund's headquarters. Peregrine Falcons have been endangered since the 1970's. This is when the international organization was formed. In 1984, the World Center for Birds of Prey was built, putting it on 580 acres of land. It sits on a hill overlooking Boise. It is a campus of buildings with numerous business offices for the Peregrine fund. They have breeding facilities for the endangered falcons. The site also has the Velma Morrison Interpretive Center, Herrick Collections Building, and a vast research library. Also onsite is the Archives of Falconry. The most important aspect of the World Center is their conservation and recovery efforts. Personnel work around the world to protect all birds of prey, and especially those that are endangered. It focuses mainly on the Peregrine Falcon since the chemical DDT wiped out most of the species. In 1999 the falcon was finally removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list. A celebration was held in Boise for the removal. The Peregrine Fund was first established by Cornell University. Four years later a Colorado Division was started. This division was moved to Boise in 1984. Morley Nelson was already in Boise, known for his expert knowledge of raptors, which is one of the reasons a large facility like the World Center for Birds of Prey was established. At the beginning only an office for the fund administration and barns for captive breeding were built. The center was the first climate controlled breeding barn created. It took until 1986 for it to be completed. The public was allowed at the site in 1992 with the Velma Morrison center. The center was devised to offer education, exhibits, and outreach programs. The directors of World Center of Birds of Prey wanted to provide a look at endangered raptors and other birds of prey for the regular person. Visitors have been able to learn about the breeding programs, the work effort involved, and even view the scientific specimen collections. The research and captive breeding center was designed to bring health, reproduction, and introduce endangered species back into the world. Their focus has been and is on understanding the birds' diet, aging, and environment. All of these aspects affect the health of the bird. The researchers also wanted to understand the growth, reproduction, and lifespan to its fullest extent. The California Condor and Aplomado Falcon have been studied. They are also part of the captive breeding program. The researchers are hoping to reintroduce these two bird species as well. In the Archive of Falconry equipment, artwork, field notes, and media collection regarding the ancient sport of falconry are all shared with visitors."
"Zoo Boise","Idaho","Zoo Boise - Boise, Idaho - small municipal zoo with around 200 animals on 10 acres","Zoo Boise is a small, modern city zoo located at Julia Davis Park in Boise, Idaho. In 1916, a chimpanzee escaped from a traveling zoo that briefly visited Boise. By the time the chimpanzee was discovered, the zoo had moved on. The city made the best of the situation and decided to house the lost chimp along with a gift of rare birds from the Sportsmen's Club at a new facility created specifically for that purpose. Throughout the 1920s, the Zoo was supported by the Boise Police Department, whose officers solicited donations of food from local supermarkets and restaurants in order to feed the animals. Despite the hardship, the zoo had grown to forty animals by the beginning of World War II. Over the next several decades, the Friends of Zoo Boise renovated and built numerous new exhibits, including bear grottoes, a tiger exhibit, an education center and the Penguin Pavilion. In 2002, in conjunction with the opening of a new Amur tiger exhibit, Zoo Boise was awarded the prestigious accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Today, the small city zoo is home to over 200 animals housed in naturalistic exhibits where the animals have room to roam and enjoy the outdoors. Each of the exhibit areas focuses on an area of the world, including Africa, Asia, North America, or South America. The newest African exhibits include an African Plains exhibit as well as a themed African village exhibit. One of the more popular exhibits features rain forest birds and animals in a naturalistic setting complete with open-air aviary and a monkey house. The zoo added two new residents during 2008, a Grevy's zebra acquired from Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, and a red panda born at the zoo. Syringa, the panda cub, is one of only 12 red panda cubs born in captivity in 2008. The Grevy's Zebra was named Hope by the schoolchildren of the city. Other popular animals at the zoo include the Madagascar hissing cockroach, the giant gecko, the gila monster, the bald eagle, the Magellanic penguin, the spider monkey, the coati, the moose, the ocelot, the snow leopard, the bobcat, the slender-tailed meerkat, and the bighorn sheep. A number of these species are classified as vanishing species'' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, so the zoo participates in conservation and breeding efforts in many cases to help boost these animals' numbers in the wild. In addition to the exhibits at the zoo, Zoo Boise also presents numerous family and adult activities at the zoo throughout the year and offers education and outreach to the schools and the community at large. Guests can also rent the zoo for special events. Admissions and Hours: Zoo Boise is open year round except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years, from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily. Admissions range from $3.75 to $6.50 with discounts available for groups. Special rates and weekly discount days are available.
