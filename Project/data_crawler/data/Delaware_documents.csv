Several cannon balls were launched from boats and from the defense on the shores as a battle that was part of the War of 1812. Local residents were attacked by the cannon balls. Those that survived actually collected the cannonballs shot at them and preserved them. This is why the park is also known as Cannonball Park. There is a granite monument constructed by the National Society of US Daughters of 1812 at the park commemorating the battle.

"New Sweden Founded in 1600's at Historic Site: the Old Swedes Church Delaware","Delaware","New Sweden Founded in 1600's at Historic Site: the Old Swedes Church Delaware","The Old Swedes Holy Trinity Church, the oldest church building in the United States that continues to stand as first built and continues in regular use, can be found in Wilmington, Delaware . The church is not only a historic building but in fact represents a historic role in the settlement of the colony of Delaware and the beginning of Nordic immigration to the United States. Although Old Swedes was not erected until 1698, its congregation is said to have held its first services in 1649, making it the oldest Christian congregation in the Delaware Valley. In 1638, Swedish and Finish colonists had founded the first permanent settlement of non-indigenous people in what would become the colony and eventually the State of Delaware. These colonists arrived on the Kalmar Nyckel (literally meaning the key of Kalmar, Kalmar being a municipality in Southeastern Sweden). In March of 1638, they founded Ft. Christina, in honor of the 12 year old Swedish Queen, thus New Sweden was born in the Americas. From Ft. Christina, New Sweden would spread along the Delaware River into New Jersey and Pennsylvania. By late 1655, though Swedish settlement continued, government by the Swedish crown had come to its end. The Dutch had laid siege to Ft. Christina; after 12 days the Swedes yielded to Dutch rule. The Dutch would not allow the Lutheran Swedes to build a church. It was only after the British defeated the Dutch in the region that the Crane Hook Church was built in 1667 by the Swedes and later the Ft. Christina graveyard was chosen as the site where the Old Swedes Church in Delaware would be built. Though construction is said to have been completed in 1698, it opened its doors officially with the dedication ceremony on July 4, 1699. Once again the Ft. Christina area was occupied by soldiers in 1777 when the British were quartered in the church following the Battle of Brandywine. Also known as Holy Trinity, the Old Swedes Church in Delaware still contains many of the original furnishings that were added in colonial times such as the original pulpit made of black maple wood and the church chest that dates from 1713. Its rich history makes Old Swedes Church an important historic site to visit in the Wilmington area. According to the website of the church, the oldest legible gravestones date from 1718 and 1726.  In all, over 15,000 people have been buried in the church graveyard. While to some this may not draw much attention, for history buffs any graveyard containing the tombs that date into the early 1700's and include soldiers from the revolutionary war period, are more than sufficient reason to pack a picnic lunch and head to this historic site in Wilmington."
