"Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa Preserves Three Prehistoric Sites","Iowa","Effigy Mounds National Monument in Iowa Preserves Three Prehistoric Sites","	Declared a national monument in 1949, Effigy Mounds National Monument is located in Allamakee and Clayton Counties in northeastern Iowa. The park preserves three prehistoric sites that contain mounds built by the Native American population for burial or religious purposes. These mounds are common throughout the Midwest but this area was one of just a handful that was home to a culture that built effigy mounds in shapes of animals, including birds, reptiles, and mammals. In all, the 2,500-acre park includes 206 mounds, 31 of which are considered to be effigy mounds. The others are conical or linear and may have been used for other purposes such as residences. The mounds continue to be considered sacred sites by the many tribes of Native Americans that live in the area. Therefore, special events of a ceremonial nature are often held here. Visitors may explore the mounds on a self-guided tour or via a guided ranger walk, which includes information on the peoples of the area and on the practice of building effigy and other mounds. There are no driving roadways inside the park so no way to explore by automobile. All exploration is done by walking or hiking. Several trails lead to the mounds and through 81.5 acres of prairie where guests can view a variety of plants, birds, and other wildlife. One short trail is accessible to handicapped visitors but most of the others are steep and at least moderately strenuous. It would take several days to experience all the trails within the park but a two- to three-hour visit is sufficient to see many of the effigy mounds. The Visitor Center, located along the Upper Mississippi River, offers a short film about mound building cultures of the Native American tribes and also provides hands-on displays for children and formal museum exhibits of ancient Indian artifacts. The Visitor Center also has a bookstore and provides trail maps and other brochures for visitors. A number of ranger-led activities also take place or depart from the Visitor Center. Several yearly events are held at Effigy Mounds National Monument. The annual Hawk Watch weekend profiles the birds of prey that make their home in this part of Iowa and educates visitors as to how they can help save these birds, some of which are rare or endangered. Also celebrated each year is Bald Eagle Appreciation Day, which focuses on the national bird of the United States and includes talks and videos. No camping is available within the park but neighboring towns and state parks do offer camping facilities, restaurants, stores, and other conveniences. Bicycles are not permitted past the parking lot in order to preserve the fragility of the mounds."

There are 72 campsite all together, and 37 of those campsites have power hook ups. Advance campsite reservation is available through the state park reservation system online. However, half of the campsites are available on a first-come-first-serve basis. Unfortunately, Lake Manawa Beach in Council Bluffs ranks at the bottom of travelers recommended attractions for the area. There are several reasons for this. A major issue is the cleanliness of the facilities at the beach and camp area. Over the last several years many travelers have reported finding the facilities dirty and in disrepair. As a result, many visit once and do not return. The most recent reviews of the park area in 2008 did not remark on any improvements to the area. Families who are interested in the area may want to try the Lake Manawa Beach for a day trip rather than an overnight as a result. Scouting the area before camping would also be advisable. However, while the bathroom facilities got panned, there were not complaints on the picnic areas. Thus, it would be possible to have a nice picnic and day down at the water without having to get too involved with the shower situation."

The par-72 course plays to 7,021 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.8 and a slope rating of 134 on Bent grass. The course is situated in a small river valley, making for a picturesque setting that features rolling fairways and a number of elevation changes. One of the more noteworthy holes comes right off the bat at No. 1. This par-4 holes plays to 426 yards from the Gold tees, and features a descent of 100 feet as it dives into the river valley and doglegs left. The tee shot will take most golfers to a downhill lie, where approach shots are aimed at a large green that's guarded by a bunker on the right and a slope that will carry wayward shots farther from their target. Hole No. 3 is a beautiful and intimidating par-3 with a forced carry over a large water hazard. The hole plays to 183 yards at its longest, and golfers will not want to miss this green on the short side. Tee shots that come up short will either find the water or some nasty rough and a severe uphill lie. Hole No. 9 is a par-4 with some interesting features. It plays to only 383 yards from the Gold tees, but the challenge comes in finding the island of a fairway. Off the tee, golfers must aim left to avoid the water hazard that runs the length of the landing area on the right. From there, an approach to the small, narrow green must cross a creek that runs around the green and feeds into another large water hazard beyond. Club selection may be tricky on this approach, as the hole is perhaps 80 feet downhill from the landing area. Hole No. 15 is another picturesque and daunting par-3 for any golfer who's intimidated by carries over large bodies of water. Playing to only 165 from the back tees, however, this hole should be an opportunity for a good score, as the green is large. Golfers must be wary, however, as the break tends to pull putts toward the lake at the front. Practice facilities at Spirit Hollow include a two-tiered driving range with Bent-grass tees and five target greens surrounded by bunkers. There's also a large putting green and a chipping area with two sand bunkers. The course also features a 7,000-square-foot clubhouse with a fully stocked pro shop and The Bar and Grill restaurant."
"The Harvester Golf Club","Iowa","The Harvester Golf Club, Rhodes, Iowa - A Championship Golf Course Built Around Lake Harvester","The Tournament Course, also known as Harvester 1,'' at the Harvester Golf Club in Rhodes, Iowa is a high-end 18-hole championship golf course designed by Keith Foster. The Tournament Course opened in 2003 and spreads throughout 300 acres of land surrounding Lake Harvester. The course plays to a whopping 7,340 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.3 and a slope rating of 133 on Bent grass fairways and greens. The layout features rolling fairways that play through the area's natural wetlands, as well as densely wooded areas and some dramatic elevation changes - up to 110 feet in some cases. In addition to Lake Harvester, the course also features several smaller ponds and streams that come into play. There are up to 80 sand bunkers on the course, but they are generally large and flat, rather than deep and punishing. The greens also tend to be large, with an average size of 7,500 square feet, but still challenging. The course features a number of particularly noteworthy holes, including No. 3. This par-3 hole goes by the name Humble Crossing,'' referencing the fact that it's essentially a peninsula surrounded by water. It's both visually stunning and unsettling, as golfers must take dead aim at the green in order to get home in three. Hole No. 9 is named Wish and a Prayer,'' and golfers may be doing just that as they contend with Lake Harvester, which not only runs along this par-4's left side, but also cuts the fairway in two. This is the #2-handicap hole on the course, with a green that's also guarded by two of the deeper sand bunkers on the course. Hole No. 11, The Sickle,'' is said to be the course designer's favorite hole. This par-4 is rated the second-easiest hole on the course, but it's not as simple as it looks. Surrounded by natural wetlands, the hole is designed to play at angles, with a slight dogleg left just off the tee. The green is guarded by bunkers that are cut well into the slope, including three on the left and one on the right. Hole No. 17 is named The Thresher,'' and it may be an even more intimidating and exacting par-3 water hole than No. 3. The hole curves around Lake Harvester on the right, making the tee shot all carry to the hole. Adding to the difficulty, the green is guarded by two deep bunkers and swales for any shots that fly the hole. The finishing hole is named Promised Land,'' and it's one of the most interesting holes golfers may ever encounter. The par-5 hole is a dogleg right that will have golfers thinking they're island hopping,'' as there are three distinct land masses. Off the tee, golfers must be straight as Lake Harvester is in play on the right the length of this hole. The next shot plays to a mid-way island , surrounded by water and connected only by cart paths on and off. Approach shots then play to a peninsula where the finishing green can be found, guarded by more water and several bunkers. Practice facilities include a driving range with grass teeing area, chipping and sand play area and putting greens. Lessons and rental clubs are also available. The Harvester Club also features the Village Center, which provides a number of amenities for residents, and a clubhouse for golfers. The View Bar & Grille is located in the clubhouse and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, while providing beautiful views of the course."
"The Tournament Club of Iowa","Iowa","The Tournament Club of Iowa, Polk City, Iowa - An Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course Near Des Moines","The Tournament Club of Iowa is an Arnold Palmer Signature public golf course located 15 miles from Des Moines. According to Palmer, his course design philosophy is as follows: A golf course must be built for all golfers and should be truly beautiful. There can be no gimmicks; every aspect of the course must serve the game of golf in the purest sense. The Tournament Club course appears to meet that standard, as it winds through 230 acres of hills, some dramatic bluffs and the timberland that surrounds two major lakes as well as Big Creek. The tees, fairways and greens play on a Bent grass blend, while the rough features several varieties of Bluegrass and Fescue. The par-71 course plays to 7,059 yards at its longest and features a good mix of open space and forested areas, including mature hardwood trees that were preserved throughout the course. The layout is also highlighted by water on 13 holes, including 12 acres of man-made lakes, to go with bluffs, valleys, ravines, and hills. There are also some unique and significant elevation transitions,'' and both of the nines have some dramatic topography. Palmer also designed many of the holes with a stadium'' feel, with holes No. 17 and 18 the highlights of that feature. The course also has excellent separation from one hole to the next, giving golfers the feel that they're alone on the course. The course also features 30 bunkers, varying from small, pot bunkers to larger waste areas. The greens tend to be large, with an average size of 7,000 square feet. There are five par-3s on the course, and collectively they've been mentioned as the best in the state. They feature some dramatic views, elevation drops, water hazards, and forced carries. Hole No. 3 is the first of the par-3s and is said to be not for the faint of heart.'' The hole is not especially long, only 186 yards from the back tee, but is still intimidating. The pin can be found on an elevated green with a severe and punishing slope for any shots to the left. The right side of the green is also sloped toward the hole, and tee shots of the right distance may be rewarded with a bounce and roll onto the putting surface. Hole No. 5 is another of the par-3s and the signature hole on the course. The most-photographed hole on the course, this hole plays to 185 yards and a massive green, which is 44 yards wide. The difficulty comes in club selection, as the hole plays downhill and tee shots must contend with swirling winds and must carry the large creek that runs the length of the green. Practice facilities include a two-tiered driving range with six Bent-grass target greens, as well as a separate chipping green with a sand bunker, and a 10,000-square-foot putting green. Lessons are also available. The Tournament Club also features an impressive, 24,000-square-foot clubhouse situated high above the golf course. The clubhouse has a fully stocked golf shop, locker rooms and dining at the Oak View Restaurant."
