"Ahalanui Park","Hawaii","Ahalanui Park - Pahoa, Big Island, Hawaii - The Big Island's Natural Hot Tub","Visitors exploring the eastern portion of the Big Island of Hawaii may wish to take a break from volcano viewing to have a soak in the natural hot springs of Ahalanui Park. Sometimes called The Warm Ponds'' by locals, the park's popular pool is spring fed, and its waters are volcanically heated to a soothing 90 degrees. Although the fortified cement walls that surround it are obviously man-made, the pool itself is naturally geothermal and covers an area equivalent to two Olympic-sized swimming pools. Lava located far beneath the park's surface is responsible for warming the fresh water that flows in from the surrounding terrain via rivulets caused by rain. The surface of the pool is usually very calm, while its bottom is made up of sand and mud, with some small rocks mixed in. The depth of the pool has been contoured to provide a shallow section for children, and ladders have been introduced to make access easy. Owing to its volcanic nature, the heated water has slight sulfur smell. Separating the pool from the ocean is a small inlet that allows sea life to access to the pool. Although the water is brackish, it is quite clear and fish can be seen swimming here among the visitors. Snorkeling in the pool is also allowed. The pool at Ahalanui Park is not a tidal pool in the strict sense of the definition, but the water level does change with the ocean tide. At high tide, ocean waves actually clean'' the pool as they swell in and out. The water temperature drops at high tide, too, as the cooler ocean water flows in. Some pockets of the pool may be warmer than others. Surrounding the entire area are palm trees. An abundance of green vegetation and the blue Pacific Ocean to the east make this an especially beautiful tropical retreat. The thermal pool is rarely crowded, too. Facilities located at Ahalanui Park include restrooms, picnic tables, barbecue grills and plenty of free parking. There are grassy and shady areas for rest and relaxation. Lifeguards are on duty during daylight hours throughout the week. Pahoa is the nearest town to Ahalanui Park, just five minutes away by car. It features several good restaurants, a grocery store, a health clinic, pharmacies, three banks, and arts and crafts shops. On weekend mornings, there is an open market, too. Camping facilities are available at nearby Isaac Hale Beach Park in Puna. Although tent camping may not be suitable in certain areas due to ground and wind conditions, and there are no electrical outlets, the park does have a pavilion, restrooms, outdoor showers, drinking water and a picnic area. Camping permits cost $5 per day for adults aged 18 years and over, $2 per day for juniors aged 13-17 and $1 per day for children aged 12 and under. Located about 40 minutes by car from Hilo, Ahalanui Park covers about three acres. It is open from 7am till sunset daily and there is no charge for admission. The address is Highway 137 Pahoa, Island of Hawaii, Hawaii. To get there by car, take Hawaii State Highway 130 through the town of Pahoa and turn left where the road ends at Highway 137. The park is about four miles further on, just near mile marker 10."
"Ahihi Bay/La Perouse Bay","Hawaii","Ahihi Bay/La Perouse Bay","Ahihi Bay also known as La Perouse Bay is located in south Maui past Makena Beach. The road ends at the natural preserve turning into black lava flow. The flows are a result of Haleakala's last eruption. The preserve attached to the bay is known for its hiking and explorations of shallow caves. The bay is used for snorkeling and other aquatic adventures.  The bay was named La Perouse because of the official visit of the European explorer Jean Francois de Galaup, the Comte de La Perouse. His visit occurred in 1786. Some of the areas around the bay and in the preserve are closed for protection of natural features, thus some of the trails will have sign closures at certain parts. Waiala Cove is a part of Ahihi Bay, where the surf tends to break. It is a good place for surfers. There are no public facilities or water, so one must come prepared to the bay and beach, especially if they are going to hike. Parking is a distance from the bay, thus proper precautions in securing vehicles is recommended. There is a marker for the preserve and bay to help visitors arrive at the right destination."
"Ahihi-Kinau Natural Preserve","Hawaii","Ahihi-Kinau Natural Preserve","The Ahihi-Kinau Natural Preserve is located in south Maui, Hawaii. It is not a recreational park but a natural area with barren, remote, and treacherous paths which can lead to some lava land, as well as numerous historical and ecological sites. Anchialina pools are not for swimming, but offer a special species of brine shrimp to see.  The bay in the natural preserve is less than 15 feet deep, though it can get deeper about 100 feet from shore. It reaches 25 to 35 feet in some areas for snorkelers, who are often interested because of the coral formations. Shallow caves near to shore add to the natural preserve. Turtles come to the rocky and sandy areas, but they are protected and should not be touched or interacted with. Parking is far from the shore, therefore proper precautions should be taken. To arrive at the natural preserve drive five miles outside of Kihei. It is a mile from Big Beach or Makena Beach on Makena Alanui Road. There is a sign marking the natural preserve, which is also surrounded by several condos and vacation homes. Ahihi-Kinau Natural Preserve is protected by the government of Hawaii and rules of visitation are posted."
"Ahuena Heiau","Hawaii","Ahuena Heiau","Ahuena Heiau is a temple on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is not like the temples you might find in other countries such as Rome or even China, but it is an important historical location for Hawaii. The temple is mostly made of wood with straw, and wood logs protecting it from the water. The temple is located at the beach in the Island of Hawaii. It is set on a stone platform but has needed re-building many times, hence the further protection.  The Ahuena Heiau was re-built by Kamehamaha the Great to use as his temple called the Hale o Lono or House of Lono. It was dedicated to the god for peace and prosperity. It is said the gods helped the King and his people. The site is also a place for rituals and food sacrifices of these old times. It was not a temple for human sacrifice. Ahuena Heiau was referred to as an oracle tower in Hawaiian history. It was a place where the high priest was said to receive answers from the gods, which he would then proclaim to the people. The tower is considered the most distinctive feature of the old temple."
"Akaka Falls State Park","Hawaii","Akaka Falls State Park - Honomu, Big Island, Hawaii - Two Impressive Waterfalls in One Park","Roughly a dozen miles north of Hilo on the Hilo-Hamakua coast, Akaka Falls State Park contains two of Hawaii's most impressive waterfalls. Both of the falls are easily accessible along a clearly marked and easily hiked loop trail. The trail begins from the parking lot at the entrance to the park, where a sign marks the trail head. Lining the path is lava rock and lush vegetation, including bamboo stands, banyan trees, and tropical flowers, such as large red ginger stalks and giant heleconia. Although much of the trail is paved, it features numerous steps, both up and down, and footing can be difficult in places. In some areas, railings have been provided for support. The smaller of the two waterfalls appears first along the trail leading off to the right. Although it is not indicated on the entry sign, this is the 100-foot Kahuna Falls, which can be seen across a small ravine, partly hidden by the foliage. The falls do not drop straight down from the mountain ahead. Instead, the water cascades down its face and has created a deep channel as it passes over the rock, almost like a vertical river. The loop trail gains in elevation as it continues on from Kahuna Falls. It actually becomes quite steep in places, but the climb is brief - no more than 100 feet - and the path levels off at the top of the incline. Even before reaching the top, hikers can hear the roar of falling water just ahead and feel the cooling breeze from the ocean. Akaka Falls is the main attraction here, located on the right shoulder of a deep gorge. It drops straight down from a height of 442 feet into a basin surrounded by rocky cliffs and verdant plant life. Although this is by no means the tallest waterfall on the Island of Hawaii, it is certainly one of the most accessible and the most photographed. In Hawaiian, he word Akaka'' means a rent, split, crack or separation.'' The water gushing out from the granite lip of the cliff and plunging into the grotto below certainly lives up to its name. As the trail begins its descent from its wooded summit, hikers emerge at a scenic viewing point. Here, the full panorama of Akaka Falls can be experienced, with rainbows formed by the spray shooting up from the rushing water. Kolekole Stream is the source of Akaka Falls. A large stone is positioned in the stream's current, about 70 feet upstream from the drop off. This stone is called P?haku o K?loa,'' or sometimes P?haku a Pele.'' According to legend, if it is struck by a branch of local lehua ?pane wood, it will call upon the sky to cloud over and rain to fall. Akaka Falls State Park is subject to high levels of precipitation, especially in April. The driest month here is June. High temperatures in the summer average in the 80's, while lows are in the 60's. In the winter, the highs and lows are about 10 degrees cooler. Facilities located in the park include bathrooms, picnic tables, shady areas, phones, and free parking. The 0.4-mile loop footpath can be traversed in about half hour, depending on how much time is devoted to viewing and photography. Trail walks are self-guided, and there is no charge for entry. To get to Akaka Falls State Park, take Highway 19 from Hilo to State Highway 220, also known as Akaka Falls Road. The turnoff to the park is clearly marked at the junction between mile markers #14 and #15. The nearest town is Honomu, a plantation village about 3.6 miles away. The park's address is Akaka Falls Road (Highway 220), Honomu, HI 96728."

"Ala Wai Yacht Harbor","Hawaii","Ala Wai Yacht Harbor","Ala Wai Yacht Harbor of Honolulu Oahu, Hawaii is found at 1599 Ala Wai Boulevard.

"Aloha Flea Market","Hawaii","Aloha Flea Market - Honolulu, Hawaii - Outdoor Shopping Among 700 Vendors","Apart from its primary function as an inexpensive outdoor market, the Aloha Flea Market has evolved into a place for families to gather, to share their cultural diversity and take pride their heritage - a melting pot of Aloha Spirit.'' For many kama'aina, (local residents), weekends at the flea market have become a social ritual. The location of the Aloha Flea Market is Aloha Stadium, a 50,000-seat facility that opened in 1975. The stadium is also home to Oahu's largest swap meet, which can be the source of some confusion. In fact, the flea market grew out of the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet, whose history dates all the way back to 1979. Today, the two are virtually indistinguishable from each other. Both are open from 8am to 3pm on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays in tented stalls surrounding the stadium. The primary distinction is that the Aloha Flea Market comprises the outer two rings of vendors, the so-called Marketplace,'' where some 700 merchants pay monthly fees to display their goods. In this sense, their tented shops are permanent,'' unlike the day-by-day swap meet venues. Many manufacturers who cannot afford to rent retail space in Waikiki offer their products at the Aloha Flea Market. For this reason, it is sometimes described as Hawaii's largest factory outlet.'' It can take more than two hours just to circle the outer ring of merchants. Among the regulars here are vendors of every kind. They sell clothing, jewelry, accessories, household goods, arts and crafts, luggage and bags, souvenirs, personalized products, plants, footwear, electronics, sporting goods, pre-packaged foods, antiques, collectibles, health and beauty supplies, fresh produce, beachwear, hats and even travel services. The atmosphere of the flea market is festive, the variety of goods is incomparable, and the prices are very competitive. Those who enjoy haggling over merchandise will appreciate the vendors' willingness to strike bargains. In fact, bartering is expected; paying full price is the exception, rather than the rule. Official management of the Aloha Flea Market has been contracted by the State of Hawaii to a major catering organization known as Centerplate. The company has long provided the food and beverage concessions for Aloha Stadium, and it specializes in overseeing such operations for many professional sports stadiums, civic arenas, and airports. Among the current concessions visitors will find here are soft drink and snack stands, ice-cold Hawaiian shaved ice, Leo's Taverna offering gyros, and Aloha Foods for a full menu of hearty meals. Visitors are advised, however, to bring bottled water, hats and sunscreen. Folding chairs can also come in handy, as there are few places to sit and rest. Transportation to the thrice-weekly shopping event from hotels in Waikiki is provided by the Aloha Flea Market Shuttle. The round-trip fare is $6.00, which includes adult admission to the market. Alternatively, visitors may take THE BUS, for a fare of $1.50 each way. Those who wish to drive will find ample free parking available. Just follow the Aloha Stadium signs from Moanalua Freeway, State Route 78. Admission is $1 for adults and free of charge for children under eleven."
"Aloha Performing Arts Center","Hawaii","Aloha Performing Arts Center","Aloha Performing Arts Center or APAC believes in giving residents and visitors of Hawaii quality theatre and theatre education.

It is also a chance for novices to try their talent after going through workshops."
"Aloha Stadium Swap Meet","Hawaii","Aloha Stadium Swap Meet - Honolulu, Hawaii - Bargain Shopping Three Days a Week","Each Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday since 1979, bargain hunters and private vendors have been gathering at Aloha Stadium for the largest open-air swap meet in the islands. Tents are set up in circular rows between the parking area and the stadium, creating an elaborate maze of goods from overseas and the mainland United States as well as competitively priced local products. Those who have attended the thrice-weekly event describe it as a cultural experience,'' not unlike visiting dozens of different countries in just one day. On offer here are items produced by the many cultures of Polynesia, from Tonga to Samoa and Fiji. Asia is well represented, too, with an abundance of goods from China, Thailand, Japan, and more. It is not unusual to hear many languages other than English spoken as transactions take place. The list of all that is available at the swap meet would fill many pages; virtually everything from electronics and household goods to fruit and tropical plants is on offer. Travel guides often describe this as the best place on Oahu to shop for Aloha shirts, pre-packaged Hawaiian foods, flowers and souvenirs. The variety of local products is certainly equal to anything available at Honolulu's shopping centers or the retail outlets of Waikiki, and prices are much less expensive, too. In fact, only malihini (newcomers) pay full price for purchases at the swap meet. The willingness of vendors to haggle helps make a sport out of shopping here. Kama'aina (local residents) come to the stadium looking to make deals. They consider the amounts marked on price tags as merely suggestions'' of the actual costs. Advertised discounts are simply the starting point for bartering between sellers and potential buyers. One bit of good local advice is to bring plenty of cash to the swap meet. Although a few of the vendors accept major credit cards, and some will take personal checks, most of them balk at offering cost reductions for payments made with anything other than hard currency. Visitors can benefits from additional tips offered by locals. For example, be sure to wear comfortable shoes. There is so much ground to cover, and with few places to sit and rest, comfortable footwear is essential. Also, bring bottled water, a broad-rimmed hat and sunscreen. The tropical sun can be unforgiving. And plan to arrive early. The most popular items often sell out quickly. Those who sell items under the rings of tents pay fees for their locations. Individuals can book a space by the day or week. Monthly rentals are also available as part of the Aloha Flea Market, which forms the two outer circles of permanent'' stalls surrounding the swap meet shelters. Indeed, many local merchants who could not otherwise afford the cost of a retail outlet in Honolulu's tourist areas make this venue their home. The Aloha Stadium Swap Meet opens at 8am on Wednesdays and Saturdays - 6:30am on Sundays - and closes at 3pm. Admission is one dollar for each adult; children under the age of eleven are admitted free of charge. From Waikiki, take the H1 west to Moanalua Freeway and just follow the signs to the Aloha Stadium. Plenty of free parking is available just outside the circles of tents."
"Aloha Tower Marketplace","Hawaii","Aloha Tower Marketplace - Honolulu, Hawaii - Waterfront Shopping and Dining","Shopping, dining and sightseeing - the Aloha Tower Marketplace has got them all, with 75 stores and restaurants, plus panoramic views of Honolulu. It has also been voted by local residents as one of the best venues on the island of Oahu for live entertainment. For shopping, the primary offerings here are apparel, jewelry and accessories, gift items and Hawaiian specialties. As a venue for souvenir hunting, it ranks among the city's best, which explains why these shops are somewhat less frequented by kama'aina (locals) than malihini (newcomers). For dining, on the other hand, the broad array of cuisines at the marketplace draws residents and tourists alike. Its two-tiered food court covers 8,750 square feet, designed to resemble a ship's deck. From the Tex-Mex menu of Bikini Cantina to the family fare of Don Ho's Island Grill, there is something for everyone. Well-known franchises, such as Hooters and Subway, and restaurants specializing in Thai, Japanese and Italian dishes are found here, too. When the Aloha Tower Marketplace opened in 1994, it turned Honolulu Harbor into the first location in the United States to combine a visitor attraction, shops and restaurants, with a functioning commercial port. Its architectural design is known as territorial-style,'' made popular in Honolulu during the 1930s and 1940s. Strolling around the marketplace can be a historical adventure. Aloha Tower, which overlooks the marketplace and harbor, was erected in 1926, using 6,000 barrels of cement painted light green and eggshell-white. It was built mainly as a symbol of the city, but it has served as a light house and customs center as well. At a height of ten stories, the views from Aloha Tower's balconies are unparalleled. One of the building's key attractions is its multi-faced clock, the largest of its kind in Hawaii and one of the biggest in the United States when it was installed in 1926. Each of its four faces weighs seven tons, with solid-cast bronze dials and frames. The clockworks occupy the space between the 9th floor offices and the 10th floor observation deck. The letters A-L-O-H-A are etched between each clock face and the cupola balcony, greeting new arrivals and bidding farewell to departures. Complimentary guided walking tours of Honolulu Harbor are offered by the marketplace's Ambassadors of Aloha. They describe not only the sights of the docks, warehouses, passenger-handling and other facilities of Piers 8~11, but also the evolution of local maritime industry and stories of colorful historic figures, such as King David Kalaukaua and more. When it comes to entertainment, Aloha Tower Marketplace has free daily performances of music from classical Hawaiian to rock'n'roll. Featured artists include some of the islands' most famous voices. School bands, choirs, hula troops, and community groups often showcase their talents at the Center Atrium, an open-air, waterfront stage area. Evening concerts and shows are scheduled each month here, and it is not unusual to see a bridal procession, too, as complete wedding packages are available at the marketplace. Other services provided are five ATMs, wheelchair services, canopied rest areas, meeting and convention capacity for groups of 25 to 10,000, and retail space leasing. Stores are open from 9am to 9pm daily (Sundays till 6pm), and dining hours are 10am to 2am, varying by restaurant."

"Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden","Hawaii","Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden - Captain Cook, Big Island, Hawaii - Conservatory for Hawaii's Endangered Plants","Located on the Kona side of the Big Island, the 15-acre plant conservatory known as the Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden is operated by four fulltime staff members under the ownership of Hawaii's Bishop Museum. It was created as a bequest from local botanist Amy Greenwell in 1974 and first opened to the public in 1988. The Garden's mission is to support Hawaiian cultural traditions of land use and plants and conserve the plant resources of traditional Hawaiian cultural activities.'' The Garden's landscape is reflective of the various bio-geographical zones that make up an ahupua'a - a strip of land that runs from the mountains to the sea. Plants here are displayed in four specific zones: coastal, dry forest, agricultural, and upland forest. On the upper five acres of the Garden, there is also an archaeological site. Gathered here are many plants that were common on the traditional farms and in the native forests of Kona before the arrival of Captain Cook in the late 18th century. Within the Garden, more than 200 species of plants thrive, including 28 listed as endangered species by the federal government, such as the rare and the beautiful koki'o. Many of these species are endemic, indigenous, or introduced from Polynesia. The collection also includes plants important to Hawaiian culture, such as taro and kukui. Self-guided visits are allowed any time during operating hours. Informational panels have been set up in the center of the Garden along a short, looping trail. Plants are clearly labeled, not only by name but also with descriptions of their traditional uses. It takes about a half an hour to explore the flora on this trail. Visitors can also walk freely around the archeological site. The stonework unearthed and preserved here was once part of the ancient Kona Field System, a 50-square-mile network of farms and gardens that existed on the island before foreign contact. Another attraction at the Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden is its native insect house, featuring Kamehameha butterflies. Visitors are advised to call ahead if they wish to see this feature, as the insects are only active during certain times of the year and the facility may be closed. One other reason to stop by the Garden is for its nursery area. Both native Hawaiian plants and Polynesian introductions are on sale here. There are ground covers, shrubs, and trees, varieties of Hawaiian taro and other traditional crops for the home garden, and, of course, flowers and seeds. Outside the precincts of the Garden proper, staff members and volunteers are also active in conserving Hawaii's biodiversity. They consult and supply landscapers, private landowners and non-profits with plants for major landscaping projects, restoration plantings, and community projects. They also offer educational programs for local schools and organizations. The Amy B.H. Greenwell Ethnobotanical Garden is open from 8:30am to 5pm on weekdays for all activities and on Saturdays for self-guided tours and nursery sales. For admission to the grounds, the suggested donation is $4 per adult visitor. Guided tours are available on Wednesdays and Fridays at 1pm for $5 per person, and on the second Saturday of each month at 10am for free. The Garden is located 22 miles south of Keahole Airport at 82-6188 Mamalahoa Highway, Captain Cook, Hawaii 96704. It can be reached by taking State Highway 11 south from Kailua-Kona to mile marker #110, about 200 yards north of the Manago Hotel."
"Anaehoomalu Bay","Hawaii","Anaehoomalu Bay - Waikoloa, Big Island, Hawaii - Splendid Sunsets and Photogenic Beach","Located on Kona's Kohala Coast and known as A-Bay'' among local residents, Anaehoomalu Bay is renowned for its sandy beach, calm waters and spectacular sunsets. This idyllic spot has long been a popular location for water sports and picnicking, and it has more recently become a favorite venue for weddings. The most dramatic characteristic of Anaehoomalu Bay is its photogenic shoreline facing west. The beach is backed by hundreds of palm trees that stand out in beautiful silhouette against the orange sky at dusk. The beach itself is made up of course sand, which can be a bit hard on bare feet for those who are used to fine sand beaches, but for photography it is picture perfect. Apart from the gently swaying coconut palms, there are two tranquil fish ponds directly behind the beach which make for scenic backdrops. There are a number of small secluded coves, too, which are perfect places to pose for the camera or escape from the revelries of the beach. Although there are no lifeguards on duty, swimming in Anaehoomalu Bay is quite safe. Thanks to a protective natural reef, the high waves and strong undertows found elsewhere along the coast are generally not present here. Although board and body surfing isn't possible under such conditions, the calm, clear waters are ideal for snorkeling and giant green sea turtles can often be seen. The gentle breezes also provide just what's needed for leisurely wind-surfing. Several enterprising businesses offer lessons and rent equipment from the beach. Items available include beach umbrellas, snorkeling gear, beach chairs and wind-surfing gear. Anaehoomalu Bay is relatively shallow and therefore accessible to small craft. On any given day, dozens of boats can be seen coming ashore or anchoring just off the coast. Some of the vessels that moor here offer charters and tours. It is possible to book a fishing expedition or a cruise around the island just be talking to the local skippers. One particularly popular outing at Anaehoomalu Bay is a glass-bottom boat tour. It allows the area's marine life to be observed without getting wet. Visibility in the Bay can be as great as 200 feet, this bringing an array of fascinating ocean creatures into clear view. Guides are available for dolphin and whale watching, too. Exploring the coastline by hiking or biking can provide some interesting discoveries. A portion of the King's Trail runs along here, an historic path created in the mid-19th century that passes by old lava rock shelters and sacred Hawaiian sites. At one point, the trail cuts through two acres of ancient petroglyphs etched into the surrounding rock. Picnic areas have been created to accommodate day trippers at Anaehoomalu Beach.

"Anini Beach","Hawaii","Anini Beach","Anini Beach is found on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii. The beach is two miles in length. It is protected by a narrow reef, which is considered the largest reef in Hawaii. Snorkeling is considered poor due to visibility. Plankton and sea debris tend to cloud the waters, but the reef brings in many marine animals, which can make it worth it to try snorkeling on calm days. Scuba diving is also an option in the deeper sections. Anini Beach tends to have some of the calmest ocean conditions, at least on the north shore of the island. Swimming is possible throughout the year, though in winter the waves can be larger, so experienced swimmers or surfers tend to go out during winter.  The calm conditions in the reef can sometimes be deceptive, meaning there can be rip currents and strong currents near the channels. It is another reason that one should stay closer to shore rather than venturing out too far to swim or snorkel. Anini Beach is perfect for sun bathing and other beach activities too. There is plenty of shade for picnics. Homes run along the beach too, so staying within the public beach limits is important."

"Aqua Waikiki Pearl","Hawaii","Aqua Waikiki Pearl - Honolulu, Hawaii - Renovated Boutique Hotel in Waikiki","One of Honolulu's newest boutique hotels is also one of its oldest. The Aqua Waikiki Pearl was christened on July 13, 2009, after $5 million in renovations that resulted not only in the new name but also in updated, upgraded and fresh guest rooms that are among the largest budget accommodations in the Waikiki area. The 10-story structure was originally designed in 1959 to be an apartment building with 76 living units. In 1966, it was converted for mid-rise hotel use with 134 rooms, and the name was changed from the Royal Prince Apartment Building to the Honolulu Prince Hotel. A heavily landscaped open-air deck was added in 1993. New York-based Ramsfield Hospitality Finance took an interest in the property and purchased it from Japan's Prince Company in 2008 for $7.75 million. For a brief time, the hotel was known as the Aqua Honolulu Prince, then the Aqua Waikiki Tides, before the current name was officially revealed along with its new look, created by local interior designer Kory Wong-Oglesby. Today the hotel boasts 135 rooms, all of which reflect the building's apartment heritage. The smallest standard rooms were formed by dividing larger units. They now have 195 to 271 square feet of floor space for single, double or triple occupancy with either one Queen Bed or a Queen and a Double Bed. Apartments that were not subdivided are quite large as hotel rooms, covering from 450 to 1,157 square feet.

"Banyan Drive","Hawaii","Banyan Drive","Banyan Drive is a street in Hilo, Hawaii. The street is lined with dozens of banyan trees along the shoreline. It is also called the Hilo Walk of Fame because the trees were planted by celebrities. The trees have managed to stand against several tsunamis, which devastated the Big Island of Hawaii.  Banyan Drive circles Waiakea Peninsula close to Hilo International Airport. In 1933, park commissioners came up with the idea to have celebrities plant trees along the peninsula. A year later, President Franklin Roosevelt was in Hilo. It was at this time a road was constructed along the edge of the Banyan trees. Cecil B. Demile and at least eight other film industry patrons decided to plant trees in the first year. Babe Ruth also planted a tree. Dozens of trees were planted in that first decade, but it slowed down in subsequent years. One of the last trees to be planted was by Polly Mooney who replanted a tree lost during a Tsunami. It was also an honorary planting for Courtney Shropshire. Edna Best, Herbert Marshal's Wife, Leo Carillo, and Mary Boland were some of the movie stars to plant Banyan trees. Amelia Earhart also planted a tree."
"Banyan Tree At the Courthouse Building","Hawaii","Banyan Tree At the Courthouse Building","The Banyan Tree at the Courthouse Building is famous in Lahaina on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. The tree was brought to the island from India. The tree was just eight feet tall at the time. It was brought to the island as a commemoration for the establishment of the Christian Mission. At the time the mission was 50 years old.  The Banyan Tree became a central focal point for the town. The courthouse was built nearby, which has led to the usage of the tree's shade for meetings, entertainment, craft shows and much more. There is a park surrounding the tree. Benches and walkways have been crafted to make it a comfortable location, just steps from the courthouse. The tree has reached 50 feet and extends about 200 feet from side to side. It can be found at Front Street, Lahaina. Its location places it near many sites in Lahaina to visit like the old fort, Brick Palace, and the courthouse. Banyan trees like the Indian Banyan tend to grow wide rather than tall. They have intricate root systems with seeds like a fig. They have been an important part of culture especially in India."
"Battleship Missouri Memorial","Hawaii","Battleship Missouri Memorial - Honolulu, Hawaii - Historic Warship Tour in Pearl Harbor","Weighing 60,000 tons, with a bow-to-stern length of 885 feet, the USS Missouri is an interactive museum and memorial at Pearl Harbor. The ship was released by the Navy and opened to the public in 1999 as a tribute to its historic significance. This is the vessel upon which the Japanese signed the terms of surrender, ending World War II on September 2, 1945. The Mighty Mo'' was launched from the New York Naval Shipyard in 1944. As the fourth and last Iowa-class battleship built for World War II, it earned three battle stars in that conflict and five more during the Korean War. It also served with distinction in the Gulf War, making it one of the most decorated ships in U.S. military history when it was decommissioned in 1992. USS Missouri Memorial Association in Honolulu received the Missouri in 1998 and moored it off Ford Island in the vicinity of two other attractions: the remains of the USS Utah and the USS Arizona Memorial. This area of Pearl Harbor has subsequently become known as Battleship Row.'' Visitors interested in touring the USS Missouri must obtain tickets and board a special shuttle at the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park. It is located on the Pearl Harbor coast, just off Kamehameha Highway, two miles west of Honolulu International Airport. General admission is $16 for adults and $8 for children. Military and kama'aina (local resident) rates apply with photo ID. Special rates for school and non-profit groups are also available when reservations are made in advance. Basic tours may be either guided or unguided. They take about one hour and begin with a shuttle ride across Ford Island Bridge. Retired military veterans and volunteers act as group guides, introducing the ship's layout, systems and weapons as well as providing a narrative history of the vessel. Visitors are permitted to enter not only the ship's decks, brig, and engine rooms, but also the Missouri's Combat Engagement Center. Winding their way through the ship, groups invariably make a stop to take in the panoramic view from the Flag Bridge, too. This is where Admiral Frederick Halsey stood in command as World War II drew to a close. A few areas of the battleship are off limits to those unaccompanied by guides. For this reason, optional extended tours are offered, which may include such extras as viewing of exclusive newsreel footage showing the Japanese surrender ceremony, presided over by General Douglas McArthur and Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. Before returning to shore on the extended tours, visitors are treated to light refreshments in the Captain's Cabin. For others seeking food and drink, the Sliders Grill serves hamburgers, hot dogs and soft drinks near the pier. During the first year after it opened, the now-peaceful battleship welcomed some 400,000 visitors. More recently, the annual number has topped one million. The USS Battleship Missouri Memorial is open daily from 9am to 5pm, creating and maintaining a fitting memorial to the people and historic events reflecting our nation's legacy of duty, honor, strength, resolve and sacrifice.''"

"Black Rock","Hawaii","Black Rock - Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii - Fine Shopping near Kaanapali Beach","Also known as Pu'u Keka'a in native Hawaiian, Black Rock is a legendary natural formation on Maui's west coast. It separates two beautiful beaches - Kaanapali to the south and Kahekili to the north. It is also the site of one of the last volcanic eruptions on the island. According to folklore, ancient Hawaiians believed that when a person died, his or her spirit would leave the temporal world on a journey to the afterlife to meet ancestors. If no ancestors came to greet the spirit, it would have to wander the earth in a ghostly form, causing mischief. The starting point for such a journey was a sacred place where the spirit could jump off'' the island into the realm beyond. It is said that every island in Hawaii has such a spot, where warriors and others left the earth to meet their ancestors. On the island of Maui, Black Rock was considered to be this jumping off point,'' and many Hawaiian natives still treat it as a very special spiritual site. Local children, on the other hand, like to use Black Rock as a very different type of jumping off point.'' They enjoy climbing to the top of the volcanic outcropping to leap into the deep waters below. Flanked by the sun-drenched sands of Kaanapali Beach and Kahekili Beach, Black Rock is a popular destination for sunbathers, swimmers and picnickers. Several resorts line the area, making access a bit difficult, but there are a number of public beach accesses available. Because Black Rock forms an excellent natural reef wall, snorkeling and scuba diving are especially good in this area when the ocean is calm. The base of the rock formation is almost completely encrusted in coral, which attracts an assortment of fish and sea turtles. From the fall through the spring, visitors to this area may be able to humpback whales from Black Rock, as they migrate some 15,000 miles to mate and give birth in the warm Hawaiian waters. It is not uncommon to see the huge sea mammals breaching just off shore between October and April. Lifeguards are on duty at the beach during daylight hours. Visitors are advised to use caution when swimming around Black Rock, as strong currents are often present at the point area. It is a good idea to closely monitor ocean conditions and always obey postings and warnings. Although there are no public restrooms or facilities at Black Rock, a great number of amenities can be found close by, including restaurants, snack bars, gift shops and restrooms located at the resorts that line the two beaches. A paved walking path stretches the entire length of Kaanapali Beach, and public pathways can be accessed between many of the hotels. Black Rock is located just beyond the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa on Maui's west coast. The address is 2605 Kaanapali Parkway, Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii 96761. To get there, take Highway 30 from Lahaina toward Kaanapali and turn left onto Kaanapali Parkway at mile marker #24. Black Rock is located at the very end of Kaanapali Beach. Limited free parking is available at the parking garage between the Sheraton and the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, although the sites fill up quickly, especially on weekends. Additional paid parking can be found at the Whalers Village shopping center nearby."
"Blue Pool","Hawaii","Blue Pool","The Blue Pool of Maui Hawaii is also known as Heleleikeoha Falls or Helele'ike'oha Falls. The falls have also been called Blue Angel Falls. The falls and the pool the freshwater falls into is one of the best natural swimming pools in the world. The falls face the ocean but are separated by rocks so that the waves crashing against them still remain separate from the pool. Locals and visitors trek to the falls to swim in the pool and relax without getting into the busy ocean. Parking in the area is limited and sometimes you might find locals selling their yard for parking.  From the end of the road one must walk to the rocky shore along the stream banks which leads to the inlet where there are white rocks mixed with lava rocks. These separate the inlet from the Pacific Ocean. Once past the inlet visitors will see the pool and falls. The waterfall is 100 feet in height. The falls are on public land, but there is sometimes resistance with locals. Some welcome visitors but others do not because most access is via private property. Boating to the area is a possibility as long as you have a secondary skiff to get to shore."
"Brennecke's Beach","Hawaii","Brennecke's Beach","Brennecke's Beach is just one of the many beaches Hawaii has to offer and particularly in Kauai. Brennecke's Beach is a popular destination for boogie boarding. Full surf boards are not allowed at the beach because the water can be too tumultuous. Brennecke's Beach is also adjacent to Poipu Beach Park. The reason that Brennecke's tends to be perfect for boogie or body boarding is the beach break. This break doesn't stop the waves from being rough, but it does offer slight protection from the rest of the ocean and between other beaches. The beach is located on the southern shore of the island.  It is a good beginner's beach for boogie boarding, where Poipu is better for the more experienced boarders. There are deeper breaks off of Poipu Beach. The waves are the largest during summer. It means that in summer you can get better waves to ride. The sandy portion of the beach is fairly small but nice enough to sunbathe on. It is also small enough to let the older kids play in the water, while still watching them. This beach does not have a lifeguard on duty, thus strong swimmers should go in."
"Brick Palace","Hawaii","Brick Palace","The Brick Palace is the former home of Kamehameha I. The palace is located in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii. In 1802 the king brought his court to Lahaina, building the Brick Palace. It was a place he welcomed captains of merchant ships. The palace was 40 feet long and 20 feet wide, with two stories. It also had an observation tower. For 70 years the Brick Palace stood on the coastline in Lahaina.  After it was abandoned as a royal location it was turned into a warehouse, store room, and then a meeting house. Any visitors traveling to the island of Maui will find the palace no longer stands, but the site is remembered today. There is a plaque that marks the spot in a local park. The park is filled with native trees, grass, and a walking path. Surrounding the park are homes and businesses. The cornerstones and foundations were excavated and put on display at the site too. To get to the site travel to downtown Lahaina, and at the harbor find a parking location. There is also a lighthouse in the area visitors can enjoy. There is no charge to view the remnants of the palace."
"Byodo-In Temple","Hawaii","Byodo-In Temple - Kaneohe, Hawaii - Hawaiian Replica of Classic Japanese Temple","Located at the foot of the Ko'olau Mountains on the windward side of Oahu, the Byodo-In Temple may look very familiar to Japanese visitors. That's because it is a scale replica of the 950-year-old Buddhist temple in Uji, Japan that adorns the face of all ten-yen coins. American visitors may also recognize the temple from its appearance in popular television series. It was used as a location to film episodes of Hawaii Five-O, Magnum P.I., and Lost. Officially designated as a Hawaii State Landmark, Byodo-In was originally built in 1968 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japanese immigration to Hawaii. Like its counterpart in Japan, this temple was erected without nails, although concrete was used liberally in the copy's construction. The temple sits at the entrance to the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park, founded by Paul Trousdale in 1963 to serve as community cemetery. Byodo-In is a functioning, non-denominational Buddhist temple, open to visitors of all faiths for worship, meditation and the appreciation of tranquility. The landscaping here is decidedly Japanese, complemented by local Hawaiian flora, with small waterfalls and meditation gardens surrounded by a natural amphitheater of mountains. Spectacular views of the ocean can be seen from the temple's Inspiration Chapel. Wildlife abounds on the temple grounds. There is a large reflecting pond stocked with Japanese koi (carp) by the hundreds. Wild peacocks and black swans make this their home, too. Among the unique attractions found here is a golden Amida Buddha, believed to be largest figure of its kind carved outside of Japan. The work of Japanese sculptor Masuzo Inui, it is more than nine feet tall. Its wood surface has been covered with cloth, painted with three layers of gold lacquer, and finished in gold leaf. Surrounding the Amida Buddha are 52 smaller sculptures of Bodhisattvas (enlightened beings). Some of them float on clouds, while others dance or play musical instruments. The main hall of the temple is called the Hoo-do, or Phoenix Hall. A pair of immortal birds are perched atop its roof as good omens. Flanking the main hall are two wings, said to reflect artistic beauty and stability, traits highly prized by the ancient Fujiwara aristocracy. Adjacent to the temple is the Bell House, or kanetru-ki-do. Its five-foot high brass bell weighs three tons and is known as the bon-sho (sacred bell). It was cast in Osaka, Japan under special permit from the Japanese government and resembles the 900-year-old original hanging in Uji's Byodo-In Temple. Removing one's shoes and ringing the bell before entering the sanctuary is customary. Also on the grounds is a meditation pavilion on the hill behind the temple. Nearby, an original Japanese tea house has been converted into a gift shop, where oriental items, souvenirs, prints and artwork by local artists may be purchased, along with food to feed the koi. Upon arrangement through the gift shop, the temple may be used for weddings, concerts, classes, workshops, funerals, and commercial photography, although permits may be required and fees charged. Guests are reminded that this is private property and the final resting place of many cremated remains. Due respect should be observed at all times when visiting."
"Canyon Trail","Hawaii","Canyon Trail","Kauai, Hawaii offers the many gardens, high cliffs, and beaches for outdoor enjoyment. One location visitors may want to explore is Canyon Trail in Kauai. It is located in Koke'e State Park. The trail runs along Waimea Canyon and ends at Waipo'o Falls. The trail is rocky with some large boulders along the way. The earth is slightly red with trees spread sporadically. The hike takes visitors up to 4,000 feet.  The canyon walls from the other side make a good picture for hikers. Waipo'o Falls are not the tallest falls in Hawaii. They are short but pretty with several plants and grass around the rocks and water pool. Wild flowers border the area around the small pool and falls. The falls cover two levels. The trail is fairly difficult, so it is best for people in shape. The trail starts at Hale Manu Valley Road, where there is parking. The lower Waipo'o Falls hike is more difficult than the upper falls that most hikers go to. The lower falls is much deeper with a waterfall that plunges down 800 feet. The water feeding both falls is cold, but that allows for a cool swim after a warm walk up the hill."
"Captain Cook Monument","Hawaii","Captain Cook Monument - Captain Cook, Big Island, Hawaii - Memorial to Hawaii's First European Visitor","British explorer Captain James Cook changed the course of Hawaiian history when he sailed into Waimea Harbor on Kauai in January 1778. His two ships, the Resolution and the Discovery, were the first European vessels ever to moor in Hawaiian waters, and Cook was reportedly the first Westerner to set foot in the territory. Shortly after his initial arrival, Captain Cook set out to explore the other Hawaiian Islands. He voyaged to the Big Island of Hawaii in early 1779. According to local legend, the locals initially saw him as an incarnation of the god Lono, but later came to revile him when a storm damaged his ship and forced him to delay the departure of his sailors. The guests'' had overstayed their welcome. History has it that Cook fell into a dispute over the theft of a longboat. When he and his crew went to retrieve it, a battle with guns, daggers and spears ensued. Cook was mortally wounded, and he died as a result on February 14, 1779. Several monuments have been erected to commemorate Cook's historic visit to the Islands of Hawaii. For example, the statue located in Hofgaard Park at Waimea is a replica of one that stands in his hometown of Whitby, England, and it resembles the Captain in life-size form. On the Big Island, however, a 27-foot-high white obelisk was erected on the shore of Kealakekua Bay to mark the spot where Captain Cook died. According to the plaque at its base, the monument was put up in November 1874 by some of his fellow countrymen.'' Locals often point out that the memorial stands on land that is still British territory, but in fact it is only owned by the British government and is really part of the United States. There are no roads leading to the Captain Cook Monument. It cannot be reached by car. Instead, visitors must use a rugged foot trail or approach by water. One of the best ways to get there is by kayak. Craft can be launched from the Kealakekua wharf and then paddled across the bay, which encompasses 315 acres, 1.5 miles long and a mile wide. It is the island of Hawaii's largest sheltered natural bay. While paddling across the clear and calm water, Hawaiian Spinner dolphins may be seen, along with giant sea turtles, colorful tropical fish and beautiful coral reefs. In places, visibility extends down to 100 feet and the temperature averages 76 degrees, making it a perfect place for snorkeling and scuba diving, too. The view of the white monument with the blue sea in front and the green cliffs behind can be quite inspiring. The shore adjacent to the west of the Captain Cook Monument is accessible. Kayaks can be beached here, while visitors walk the footpath and take a look at the historic marker up close. Several boat tours are also available to take guests along Kealakekua Bay to the monument, for those who might find the effort of sea kayaking too strenuous. Neither food nor water is available at the site, so tour users should make sure whether these are provided as part of the excursion. Bringing along sunscreen, a hat, and a camera is also recommended. The Captain Cook Monument is located within Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park off State Highway 160, south of Kailua."

"Chain of Craters Road, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Chain of Craters Road, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Drive Through an Active Volcanic Area","This 18.3 mile drive through the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park features many scenic pullouts and side trails. It varies in elevation from sea level to 4,000 feet. There are no special facilities or services along the way, other than simple toilets. They are located at Mauna Ulu, mile marker 3.6, and at the very end of the road. It is a good idea to come prepared with plenty of drinking water and sunscreen. A hat and good walking shoes are recommended if any off-road hiking is planned. The first site along the way is at mile 0.2, where a two-car pullout is located. This is the trail head for the Keanakakoi Crater Hike. About a third of a mile along, several shade trees can bee seen jutting out from the dark landscape-The Lava Trees-survivors of the 1974 lava flow. Back on the road, which begins rising to a height of 3,500 feet, stops can be made at mile 0.4 to see the Lua Manu Crater, 0.9 for the Puhimau Crater and Thermal Hotspot, and 2.2 for the Devil's Throat pit crater, formed in 1912. At mile 2.5 is the Hi'iaka Pit Crater, 300 feet deep and 1,200 feet in circumference. At mile 3.1 is the Pauahi Crater, active as recently as 1979 and measuring about 350 feet deep, 300 feet wide and 1,800 feet long. The Pu'u Huluhulu and Mauna Ulu craters at mile 3.6 are noted for their fissures, odd rock formations, and the Pu'u O'o vent. Trails are numerous here and well worth exploring. At mile 4.1 is the Ainahou Ranch, built in 1941 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other volcanic sights to see along the route are Mauna Ulu at mile 6.2 and Muliwai a Pele at 7.2. The outlook at marker 9.6 is called Kealakomo. An excellent view of the coast can also be had at mile 10.2, known as the H?l?na Kahakai pullout. From here the road begins to descend about 1,500 feet. At mile 11.5 the road cuts through solid lava rock and takes a 180 degree hairpin turn. Alanui Kahiko can be found at mile 13.7, a place where lava has covered the old road. At mile 14.9 is the Skylights Climb, a trail that leads up a hill with a hole in it-the Lava Tube Tumulus-where magma was once vented. Among the top attractions to be seen during this drive are the ancient lava rock carvings known as the Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs, at mile 16.5. They are accessible from the parking area, a 0.7-mile walk over undulating pahoehoe bedrock where more than 23,000 petroglyph images appear. Most of these are cupules or holes, but others are clearly human forms, circles, and canoe sails. They were made in the early 15th century, when the area was still inhabited and a frequent stopping point for visiting seafarers. A final must-see attraction is hot lava pouring into the sea at mile 18.3. The molten rock throws up plumes of steamy white vapor as it hits the cool water, but it is best viewed in the evening when the red glow of the lava can be seen as it flows down to the coast. Any attractions missed on the way in can be seen on the return journey, for the road dead-ends here, where solidified lava has crossed the road en route to the Pacific Ocean. The only way back is the same road that led in. To get to the start of this scenic drive, take State Highway 11 to the entrance of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Pass the park gatehouse and turn left onto Crater Rim Drive for three miles to the intersection of Chain of Craters road. Turn left onto Chain of Craters road. The park is open from 7:45am to 5pm daily. The entry fee is $10 per vehicle."

"Chinaman's Hat","Hawaii","Chinaman's Hat - Kaaawa, Hawaii - Secluded Beach and Great Views on Mokolii Island","Mokolii Island, more commonly known as Chinaman's Hat,'' is a cone-shaped outcropping of lava located off Kualoa Point on Oahu's Windward Coast. It sits in Kaneohe Bay, resembling a the broad-rimmed headpiece commonly worn by rural Chinese peasants. A Hawaiian fable relates how the island came into existence and got its official name. Legend has it that a huge dragon was slain by Hiiaka, the sister of the powerful volcano goddess, Madame Pele. Hiiaka chopped off the creature's tail and threw it into the ocean, leaving its body on shore. The flukes of the severed tail jutted up out of the water to become this island. The natives called it Mokolii,'' meaning little lizard,'' in reference to the story. Today, Chinaman's Hat, or Mokolii Island, is part of Kualoa Regional Park. The entire 157-acre property was purchased by the government from a private landowner in the 1970s. Soon after, archaeologists discovered that Mokolii and the Kualoa area were of historic importance. Evidence has shown that Kualoa was the training ground for Oahu's high chiefs. It was also the residence of Kualii, first king of Oahu. The eastern part of Mokolii was a quarry, and basalt taken from it was used to make adze for Hawaiians warriors. They used seawater and sand poured into hollows in the island's rock to shape their blades. Traces of these work areas can still be seen even now. At low tide, it is possible to kayak or wade out to Chinaman's Hat. Looking back to Oahu, beautiful views can be seen of the Koolau Mountains, Mokapu Peninsula, Kaneohe, Kahaluu, and Kailua, so be sure to bring along a camera. Because the reef surrounding this small island is the habitat for a wide variety of marine life, it is widely regarded as one of Oahu's best offshore islands for exploration. There is a little beach on the ocean-facing side, nestled within a secluded cove accompanied by a few coconut palms. It provides a great location for sun bathing or picnicking. Making it to the top of the island's steep cone can be a challenge. The ascent passes through thick brush down below, followed by crumbling dirt and cinders further on. Toward the peak, ancient lava ledges appear. Even taking the approach with the least gradient, the climb can take 20 minutes, but just about everyone who makes the attempt can reach the top. Good shoes are must, of course, as the volcanic rock can be slippery as well as quite jagged. Whether you circle around the island to the beach or go straight over the top, there is much to be seen. You will come upon a small cave carved out of the lava near the beach, which is well worth investigating. Seabird nests are common on the slopes, many of them containing eggs, chicks, and nervous parents. In the clear water surrounding the island, if you watch carefully, you might even see baby hammerheads. And of course the coal formations can be simply beautiful. To reach Chinaman's Hat, take the Kamehameha Highway north from Kaneohe up the east shore to Kualoa Point State Recreation Area. It is about a 45-minute drive from Honolulu. The island is offshore just a few hundred yards from the picnic grounds."

The makai, which is the ocean side, is filled with native plants, beach, and ocean views. Hawaiian history states that in the early morning one can look for the hinahina, which is the name given to the Hawaiian moon goddess. The trail is not only a great place to get a short walk, but also to watch whales in the winter months. The trail can begin at Polo Beach. The trail is one of about 10 trails in Maui. Since the trail is part of the town area in Maui there are a variety of restaurants and hotels close to the trail. The trail can be taken to get from beach to beach instead of driving. The trail is mostly for exercise and viewing the ocean from the resort beaches. It can be a nice walk for those who enjoy walking or jogging for exercise over fitness centers, which is why locals use the trail too."
"Coconut Island","Hawaii","Coconut Island","Coconut Island is off O'ahu in Kane'ohe Bay in Hawaii. It is a marine biology research facility with the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology and University of Hawaii facilities. Christian Holmes II built up the 12 acre island with coral rubble, earthen landfill, and sand off of his Fleischmann yeast earnings. He created a residence with kennels, aquaria, and aviaries for all of his pets.  The island was worked on between 1934 and 1936. It eventually became a location for the US Navy flyers. It was considered a relaxation and resting island during World War II. In 1947, the island was purchased by Edwin Pauley and four other business men of Los Angeles. They converted the island to a resort club and hotel. It ran as a resort community from the 1950s to the 1980s. For approximately a ten year period after that Katsuhiro Kawaguchi, a Japanese real estate investor, owned half the island. The University had purchased the other half. The Edwin Pauley Foundation provided a gift of $9.6 million in 1995. It was this gift that allowed the University of Hawaii to purchase the rest of the island and build labs on it. It is now completely owned by the state as a part of the University of Hawaii."

A Harvard University graduate, he arrived in Honolulu in 1899 with only $1,200 and proceeded to launch Hawaii's pineapple industry single-handedly on the 60 acres of rich red soil where the Plantation now resides. Today, the Dole Plantation combines elements of farming, a historical museum and a theme park into one Complete Pineapple Experience.'' Unique activities, educational displays, shopping and dining draw nearly one million visitors a year. One of the most popular attractions here, the Pineapple Garden Maze, opened in 1998 and was expanded in 2007. Covering more than two acres with a total path length of 3.11 miles, it is among the world's largest mazes, using 14,000 colorful Hawaiian plants, from hibiscus to panax and, of course, pineapple. The center of the maze is shaped like a huge pineapple, made up of croton with a crown of agapanthus. There are eight secret stamp stations'' hidden along the route for visitors to find and mark their progress. Prizes are awarded to those who complete the course and collect all eight stamps the fastest; winners' names are listed on a sign at the maze entrance. To date, the fastest times are around seven minutes, with averages closer to 45 minutes or an hour. Another special attraction is the Pineapple Express Train Tour.

For dining, the Plantation Center offers a Grown in Hawaii'' lunch menu. It includes Teri Chicken, Kalua Pig and Mahi sandwiches, Teri Burgers with cheese, and a number of salads using ingredients from the islands.

Here, visitors can have an unforgettable face-to-face encounter, touching, feeding, playing, learning and swimming with these gentle aquatic mammals. The adventure takes place in the 26,000-square-foot natural lagoon of the Kahala Hotel & Resort, one of Honolulu's most luxurious properties. Emphasis is placed on education and the emotional context of being in direct contact with these beautiful sea creatures. Few come away from the experience without being touched in both the mind and the heart. A number of different packages are available, ranging from the Wee Family, Fins and Fun'' discovery program for toddlers to the new Trainer for a Week,'' which allows the creation of an individualized experience with dolphins.

Four of the lagoon residents were born at Dolphin Quest Hawaii on the Big Island.

Nainoa has a chocolate-colored topside, while Kainalu likes to get attention by splashing people. As an accredited member of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, Dolphin Quest makes every effort to see that each encounter is as safe as it is memorable. Participants must be able to follow directions, move about freely within the water environment, and handle heat, humidity, direct sun exposure and wind.

The beach itself is a mile long of white sand in the form of a crescent. The surf here can get big, especially in the winter months, and the beach slopes steeply into the ocean, making it particularly dangerous for small children.

This beach has restrooms, showers, a public telephone, picnic tables and grills for barbecuing as well as a snack bar and bar.

"Goat Island (Mokuauia)","Hawaii","Goat Island (Mokuauia) - Honolulu, Hawaii - Day Trip to a Private Island","Mokuauia, also known as Goat Island, is a saddle-shaped rock formation covering thirteen acres in Laie Bay on Oahu's windward coast. Composed of raised limestone, sand and sandy soil, it rests inside a reef that fringes the shoreline. Legend has it that this island and four others near Laie Point were formed by the demigods Niheu and Kana. They supposedly killed a great lizard and threw its pieces into the ocean, which became these islets. The name Goat Island,'' however, derives from a more recent time, when Laie residents used to graze their goats here. Mokuauia is low and flat, reaching a maximum elevation of only 15 feet. It can be reached by kayak from the recreation area at Malaekahana State Park across a shallow channel that is about 400 yards wide. At low tide, it is possible to wade from shore to the island. However, at high tide the surrounding currents and riptides can be strong, making access and return difficult. Viewed from a distance, the island has a rather bumpy appearance. This is caused by the burrowing of seabirds as they nest. A survey conducted in 2000 estimated that more than 6,500 Wedge-tailed shearwaters of breeding age were present on the island, up from only several hundred in the 1960s. In the very center of the island is a restricted area, the State Seabird Sanctuary managed by the Hawaii DOFAW. It provides refuge to many species of ground-dwelling birds that raise their young here. State and federal laws protect the wildlife and plants within the clearly marked sanctuary. Visitors must obey all posted signs, avoid the island interior, and refrain from disturbing nesting areas, seabirds and shorebirds. Elsewhere on the island, brackish tide pools provide excellent locations for observing small sea life, including native shrimp. There are two sandy beaches, one of which has coral formations in the shallows nearby, while the other on the west shore is protected and preferred for swimming. The presence of reef-dwelling fish, octopi, sea urchins and lava pockets makes the waters surrounding Mokuauia ideal for snorkeling. Besides birds, the island is also home to 52 plant species, only sixteen of which are native. Among local insects, fire ants dominate, accompanied by a rare, yellow-faced bee identified as Hylaeus anthracina. Black rats have occasionally been seen on the islet, too, although the Hawaii DOFAW instituted an eradication program in 2006, which has been largely successful. Because Mokuauia is easily accessible, yet unspoiled, it has become one of Oahu's most popular day drips for fishermen, surfers and picnickers, particularly on weekends. Those wishing to visit are advised to protect their feet from coral and rocks by wearing sneakers or reef shoes instead of flip-flops. Any items taken to the island must be removed when returning to the shore; dogs are strictly prohibited. Wading to Goat Island from Cooke's Point takes only fifteen minutes at low tide. The entire perimeter of the island can be hiked in 20~30 minutes. To get there by car, take the Kamehameha Highway north of Laie just a few miles to the Malaekahana State Park Recreation Area where parking is available. Goat Island can be seen just offshore."

It is one of the more used highways because of the various sites you can visit from it. Hosmer Grove in Haleakala National Park is just off of the highway. It is one of many sites with desert, and volcano. The summit of Haleakala has a center on top for visitors to enjoy. There is also a parking area so that one can enjoy the views and panoramic views of the crater and surrounding landscape. Before arriving up at the summit and the desert, one will travel through the rainforest. The crater is by the most spectacular view especially at different times of day and the year when the clouds and sun change position."
"Halekulani","Hawaii","Halekulani - Honolulu, Hawaii - A ``Heavenly'' Luxury Hotel on Waikiki Beach","The history of the Halekulani stretches back to 1907, when Robert Lewers opened the Hau Tree residential hotel on this Waikiki Beach property. In the beginning it was just a beachfront house and five bungalows, but in 1917 the grounds were expanded to five acres, more bungalows were added, and the hotel was given its current name, which means House Befitting Heaven.'' In 1930, the old Lewers home was replaced with a plantation-style main building. Then in 1984, four low-density wings were added in place of the bungalows, along with lush gardens and open courtyards, to create the intimate 453-room resort seen here today. None of the buildings rises higher than 17 stories, making the Halekulani something of a hidden gem among the towering structures that line the ocean shore on either side. Indeed, the hotel's mission to provide a luxurious holiday experience, as defined in its three guiding principles: Wellness, Connoisseur, and Masterworks. Everywhere within the resort, emphasis is placed on soothing each guest's mind, body and spirit through the introduction of fine cuisine and fine arts, amid the natural beauty that is Waikiki. All guest rooms are fully air-conditioned, featuring wall-to-wall carpeting, a separate sitting area with a love seat and chair, a coffee table, business desk, large personal terrace and either twin or king-sized beds. Standard room sizes range from 519 to 720 square feet, and the majority offer views of the Pacific. Among the dozens of elegant suites available here are three special Premier Suites overlooking Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. The one-bedroom Vera Wang Suite, created by the famous designer herself, exudes stylish sophistication with 2,135 square feet of interior space, plus a 642-square-foot oceanside lanai. The Orchid Suite has a distinctly European flair, while the Royal Suite, which is the largest at 4,066 square feet, emphasizes traditional Hawaiian elegance. It has two bedrooms, a dining room, dressing area, 2.5 bathrooms, full kitchen facilities, a large wraparound lanai and its own personal butler service. A special treat for guests at the Halekulani is access to the hotel's luxury car collection. The fleet includes a Maserati GranTurismo, a custom-designed Bentley Continental GTC, a Lotus Elise, and a Lotus Exige S. Vehicles may be rented for the day or are included for the free use of those staying in any of the Premier Suites. Other guest facilities on the premises are a 46'x82' heated pool and an award-winning spa, along with a fitness room, a business center, 8,200 square feet of meeting space, and a hospitality suite. There is also an in-house laundry and dry cleaning facility, a print shop, bakery, florist and the teak-paneled Halekulani Ballroom, which can accommodate receptions for up to 500 persons.

"Halemaumau Trail","Hawaii","Halemaumau Trail","Halemaumau Trail is located on the Island of Maui, Hawaii. It is a 3.5 mile trail that starts around the visitor center and goes about 500 feet into the floor of the Kilauea Crater. The trail will then cross the crater and end at Halemaumau Overlook. The trail and crater are in the rain forest, but the Kilauea Caldera is more desert like than the rest of the trail. The trail is only 3.5 miles one way, meaning a round trip is 7 miles.  The trail is considered moderately difficult meaning it is best to have some hiking experience. One does not have to take the same path back from the crater. Crater Rim Trail and other short paths will wind back to the same parking spot and allow for a different trail of sights along the way. While one is hiking look for pahohoe lava flors, steam vents, craters, and spatter ramparts. All of these can be seen if you look for them. Any individuals with heart disease, breathing troubles, or suspected pregnancy should avoid the trail as it does have sulfur fumes. It is another reason it is considered a moderate trail to take."
"Halepalaoa Beach","Hawaii","Halepalaoa Beach","Halepalaoa is also referred to as Kahalepalaoa beach. The name of the beach stands for whale house. The longer version Kahalepalaoa is usually translated as whale ivory house. The beach is located on the east site of Lanai, Hawaii at Keomoku Trail. It is slightly off road from any neighborhoods.  Maunalei Sugar Plantation used the beach in order to ship their sugar from the wharf which still exists at the site. The wharf is only ruins now though. The beach has a nice border of detritus sand. It is also one of the oldest wharfs in the Hawaiian Islands to have white sand. Visitors can enjoy swimming, sunbathing, or strolling along the sand. If one is going to swim they need to be an expert and watch for any strong currents. Surfing can be an option here as well, though most come to sunbathe or stroll on the sand. It is possible to access the off road site by 4x4 vehicle only. This is if the weather permits too. The track can be hard to pass through during rainy days. It is more of a local beach rather than one for visitors given its off road location."
"Halona Blowhole","Hawaii","Halona Blowhole","Halona Blowhole is a rock formation on the Island of Oahu. The blowhole is set overlooking Hanauma Bay. A blowhole means that it is linked with the ocean. When the waves come through and the tide is high enough water can spout through the hole in the rocky cliff, seeming like a whale's blow hole. On windy days the water will shoot up from the rock formation like a geyser through the cave.  The blowhole is considered the most active when the wind and high tide combine. Halona Blowhole is one of the more popular locations to visit in Hawaii as many visitors come from around the world in order to see the beach cove, the scenery, and the blowhole. It can also be a winter spot for seeing humpback whales. Often Green Sea Turtles are also spotted swimming around the beach. Diving is possible if the winds are light from the north. It is only recommended when there is no surf because of the rocky coastline. Still, if one gets a chance it is best to look at the coral and rock beneath for the beautiful corals and marine life that have formed a home in this area."
"Halulu Heiau","Hawaii","Halulu Heiau","Halulu Heiau is an archeological site on Lanai, Hawaii.

It was built around 1819.  At first the Heiau was a place of refuge, which was built by King Kamehameha. It was meant to challenge anyone who broke the law. Most outlaws would have to make it to the temple in order to be forgiven. They had to make it before they were caught. Today it is a three mile drive along rocky road in order to reach it. The dry season is the only time the site can be seen and even then 4x4 vehicles are needed. To the left of the site is Kahekili's Leap or Warriors Leap, which is a natural platform 80 feet above the ocean. Warriors used to leap from the cliff to prove their worth. It is not permitted to enter the Heiau or walk on the walls."

This area of the island where the beach is located is a section that is isolated from the larger population centers in other parts of Maui. The nearest airport is in Kahului, some 60 miles away along the Hana Highway. This beach gets extremely high surf as there are no reefs in the area. The summer and the start of the fall are when the waters are generally the calmest and thus the time for the safest swimming. There is no lifeguard at this beach. Expert local surfers pick up waves right off the beach in the afternoons although the strong surf here is calmer than many Hawaiian beaches. The beach is open 24 hours a day. Lush vegetation and 30 ft. tall cliffs surround the bay here. The beach is 100 ft. wide with white sand. Hala trees stand between the sand and the sea cliffs. Hamoa Beach is one of several pockets of beaches in this area. It offers excellent swimming, bodysurfing and snorkeling conditions. To get to the beach one must leave their vehicle on a cliff above and walk down a stairway. A small island with coconut trees is located off the shore. There are restrooms and picnic areas along the sandy beach. This beach has been named among the top 10 Best Beaches of America that are annually named by Dr. Beach,'' a Florida International University Professor, Dr. Stephen Leatherman. Leatherman has been publishing an annul best beaches list based on a 2 year study of 650 public beaches in the US and using 50 criteria for comparison since 1991.

There are also cottages right at the beach level just 50 ft. from the breaking surf of the South Pacific. Budget travelers can find reasonable lodgings nearby, including campgrounds. If budget travelers stay near Hamoa Beach however, it is recommended they buy groceries in Kahului, where the airport is since nearby Hana is more costly due to its isolation. A number of restaurants can be found in nearby Hana, a five minute trip from this beach. There are also a variety of gift shops and florists there."
"Hana Bay","Hawaii","Hana Bay","Hana Bay is just one of the bays with beach in Maui, Hawaii. It is notable for its large size and black sand. The black sand is a result of lava erosion. The erosion causes the black soot to wash into the ocean from a stream close by. The deposits then make their way onto the beach. Over time this has caused a completely black beach. The beach and bay is protected making it a safe area for swimmers. Hana Bay is often a place that residents go for the weekend, as well as families. Picnics and water activities are possible at the bay. Some of the water activities include outrigger canoe races. Clubs tend to practice in the late afternoon. Outrigger canoe races are an ancient Hawaiian sport. To the right of the bay is Hana Pier.  Services and amenities are possible on site, but there is no lifeguard. Picnic facilities and a pavilion are available along with a snack bar and restrooms. A small boat harbor is to the right for those who want to rent a boat or bring their boat.

"Hanakapi'ai Trail","Hawaii","Hanakapi'ai Trail","Hanakapi'ai Trail is part of the Kalalau Trail, which brings visitors to Hanakai'ai Beach in Kauai, Hawaii. The trail begins two miles away from the beach. It is also an additional two miles up to the Hanakapai'ai valley close to the falls. These falls are over 50 feet in height with a quick but thin stream of water. The water falls into a beautiful blue green pool, which is surrounded by verdant forest and cliffs. The trail is fairly remote as are the falls, but it is a gorgeous area according to locals. The Na Pali Hike is another challenging option in the same area.  No facilities can be found on the trail, meaning no water or toilets. Camping at Hanakapi'ai has also been closed for the foreseeable future. The trail is considered four miles one way if you decide to go to the beach and up to the falls. It has also been rated as a difficult and strenuous hike due to the uphill travel and some of the rocky terrain. It is not a paved path up to the falls or down to the beach.

It can be a rather strenuous hike to reach Hanakapiai Falls.  The trail may be rough, but the falls are worth a look given they are 300 feet. Native plants surround the falls and the path up. There is even a small bamboo forest. The falls run along the Na Pali Coast. When visitors arrive at the falls there are rugged valley walls which add to the site. Given the 4 mile hike from Hanakapiai Beach and back, most visitors elect not to take the trail to see the beautiful falls. It makes the trek a quiet and enjoyable one for those who have the stamina to reach the falls. The falls and streams all end up back at the ocean."

"Harold L. Lyon Arboretum","Hawaii","Harold L. Lyon Arboretum - Honolulu, Hawaii - A Unique Rainforest and Garden Experience","The Lyon Arboretum is America's only university botanical garden located in a tropical rainforest. Established by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association in 1918, its original purpose was to gather plants of economic value, to identify species of trees for reforestation and to show the value of restoring watersheds. Its mission shifted from forestry to horticulture when it became part of the University of Hawaii-Manoa in 1953. Today, the Arboretum has an extensive tropical plant collection that emphasizes native Hawaiian species and tropical palms. Sections are also dedicated to aroids, ti, taro, heliconia and ginger. Scientific research, botanical education, species preservation, and community engagement are its primary objectives. Covering just over 193 acres at the top of the Manoa watershed, at elevations ranging from 450 to 1,850 feet, the Arboretum complex features small cottages and greenhouses, laboratories, classrooms and a living library'' of horticulture. Its many rainforest trails are accessible for hiking and have been marked to provide learning opportunities for visitors. Each year, more than 34,000 participants take advantage of the Arboretum's classes, research projects and community activities, or simply walk the grounds to enjoy the plants on display. The facilities here are used regularly by Hui Hana, the Garden Club of Honolulu, and the local Arboretum Association. Hard as it may be to believe, this lush property was once a wasteland of thickets. Free-ranging cattle had denuded the land prior to 1918. Under the direction of a young Minnesota botanist named Dr. Harold L. Lyon, some 2,000 tree species were planted on the grounds. The project was known as the Manoa Arboretum. The dense vegetation here now is a testament to Dr. Lyon's reforestation efforts. When he passed away in 1957, the facility was renamed the Harold L. Lyon Arboretum in his honor. Two popular attractions at the Arboretum are the Ti Walk'' to the Bromeliad Garden and Inspiration Point, which takes about an hour, and a visit to Aihualama Falls. The waterfall is located along a footpath from the parking lot. The trailhead can be found at the end of Lyon Arboretum Road, and the round-trip walk covers about 1.5 miles. For self-guided exploration, the gardens are open 9am to 4pm each Monday through Friday, and on Saturdays from 9am to 3pm. Alternatively, one-hour guided tours are available (weekdays only) and start at 10am; a $5 fee applies and reservations must be made at least 24 hours in advance. The Arboretum closes on Sundays and public holidays. As part of it community outreach efforts, the Arboretum provides a variety of school activities and adult education courses, including Elderhostel outings. Internships, summer programs and special events are also offered, and three plant sales are scheduled during the year, featuring items from local nurseries in addition to plants grown in the greenhouses here. The grounds of the Arboretum are available for weddings, receptions, group meetings, parties, concerts, wakes, classes, and other types of events upon request. Professional filming, however, is by permit only. Guests should sign in at the Lyon Arboretum Visitor Center and receive a trail map before exploring the gardens. There is no charge for admission, although a $5 donation to the University's College of Natural Sciences is recommended. Drinks, snacks, books and gifts are available for purchase at the Visitor Center; plants are sold at the main greenhouse. The Arboretum is located at 3860 Manoa Road, Honolulu, HI, 96822. The entrance can be reached by taking the Manoa Road from Honolulu until it ends just beyond Paradise Park. Entrance to the Lyon Arboretum is at the end of Manoa Road."
"Hawaii Convention Center","Hawaii","Hawaii Convention Center - Honolulu, Hawaii - Focal Point for Business in Oahu","The $350 million Hawaii Convention Center (HCC) was designed by local architectural firm Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo to be a study in ecology, energy-efficiency, and functional artistry. Since its opening in 1998, the HCC has won a number of awards for its design, which reflects the unique culture, community and environment of the Islands. In the airy, naturally lit glass-walled lobby, a misty waterfall pours down 70 feet to a pond flanked by abstract steel trees'' and real coconut palms. Canvas canopies cover the foyer, looking much like cresting ocean waves or the sails of tribal canoes. Leading to the Ala Wai Promenade is a grand exterior staircase, and lush landscaping adorns more than 60 percent of the property, including an award-winning rooftop garden that occupies 2.5 acres with ponds and tropical flora. Original artwork has been incorporated into the HCC, such as pieces created by local youth and a fresco by the late Jean Charlot. The towering glass walls reveal the dramatic mountains to the south as visitors travel up the multi-level escalators. Every aspect of the Center has been designed to be pedestrian friendly and aesthetically pleasing. The HCC's energy-saving systems center on its $10 million ventilating and air-conditioning system, which was engineered especially for Honolulu's tropical climate. To ensure air quality, special filters have been fitted to the air intakes that absorb diesel and gas vapors, thus insulating the exhibit halls, lobby, administrative areas, food service area and main kitchen from pollutants outside. HCC by the numbers is an inspiring facility. There is more than 200,000 square feet of exhibition space in the main hall, which features drive-on floor access and can handle load capacities of up to 350 pounds per square foot. The registration lobby alone takes up 35,000 square feet and the production kitchen occupies another 20,000 square feet. The HCC's 47 meeting rooms total 149,768 square feet in usable area. There are also two separate high-tech theaters with tiered seating that can be used for presentations or screenings. And with 30,000 hotel rooms in the vicinity, one-third of which are within a mile of the Center, there is plenty of space for out-of-town visitors. Roughly 10 percent of meeting rooms are executive quality. There is a special teleconferencing center, several lounges and informal gathering places, and niches for displays. Even the 27,500-square-foot parking area and its 700 stalls can be utilized for convening outdoor events, in addition to 3.5 acres of terraces, lanais, and courtyards. The HCC is wired for every possible need. There are LAN, WAN and shared or dedicated Ethernet connections, coaxial cable for video interconnects in all major building areas, wireless phone service, six-station simultaneous interpretation rooms, press rooms with global links to any country , connectivity to the network for computers in all meeting rooms, and high-speed Internet access throughout the facility.

"Hawaii Nature Center","Hawaii","Hawaii Nature Center - Honolulu, Hawaii - Connecting Kids with the Environment","Since 1981, the Hawaii Nature Center's mission has been to teaching the young people of the Islands about their natural environment, fostering awareness, appreciation and understanding of Hawaii's fragile ecosystems. Additionally, it provides visitors with a unique, educational experience. The Center started out in the Makiki Valley of Oahu, just minutes from urban Honolulu. Its field site was no more than clearing called the Outdoor Circle then, but it has grown over the years to include a main building and four learning centers, guided interpretive hikes, nature adventures, earth care projects, day camps, and more. In 1992, the Center expanded operations to Maui, setting up a similar facility in the Iao Valley. Today, weekend and community programs conducted on both islands reach 25,000 families a year. In total, more than 800,000 children and adults have participated in environmental education activities. Working directly with the local schools, the Center has developed programs that focus on unique ecosystems for each grade level. Courses have been created to teach an Introduction to Plants and Animals, with emphasis on food chains and habitats; Cycles in Nature, stressing natural, biological and physical cycles; an Introduction to Wetlands, featuring local habitats for water birds; Forest Encounters, covering geological, biological and human-caused change found in wooded lowlands; and Coastal Encounters, fostering understanding of coastal ecosystems, while promoting a sense of stewardship for these special places. Although the primary target of these is hands-on field programs for preschool through 5th grade, older students, teachers, local hikers and visiting tourists are welcome to avail themselves of the Center's resources and the opportunity to get outside and explore nature with the Center's staff. Programs are offered for older children and adults; there are guided hikes for residents and visitors; and children's birthday parties can be arranged in a natural setting. The Hawaii Nature Center also conducts an Outreach Program, targeting children and families who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit the Center. Educators and volunteers spread the word with fun interactive displays and nature crafts at fairs and exhibits statewide, such as the Pacific Handcrafters Fair, the Hawaii State Farm Fair, and the Molokai Earth Day Fair.

"Hawaii Nature Center of Iao Valley","Hawaii","Hawaii Nature Center of Iao Valley - Wailuku, Maui, Hawaii - Promoting Appreciation of Nature in Maui","Founded in Honolulu in 1981 as a private nonprofit organization, the Hawaii Nature Center has a mission to foster awareness, appreciation and understanding of Hawaii and its natural environment. It accomplishes this by teaching Hawaii's young people about their surroundings, encouraging wise stewardship of local ecosystems, and providing visitors with a unique and educational experience. Located in the scenic Iao Valley, Maui's branch of the Hawaii Nature Center provides kids and adults with a variety of ways to understand and appreciate the beauty and science of one of the island's most lush natural habitats. It does so by presenting some 30 interactive displays, a solarium with local flora, and guided walks into the rain forest, which is located not far from where segments of the movie Jurassic Park'' were filmed. The center's Rainforest Walk takes participants into the vegetation of the Iao Valley, which receives some 400 inches of rain every year. Featuring native and introduced Hawaiian plants as well as the remains of ancient dwellings, the course follows a moderate loop trail along ancient footpaths and across Iao Stream. The excursion is conducted by an experienced guide, who explains not only the flora, fauna and geology of the region but also the folklore and legends associated with this historic location. Walks begin at 11:30am and 1:30pm weekdays, and at 11am and 2pm on weekends. Participants must be aged five or older. Following the hike, visitors are invited to spend time in the center's Interactive Nature Museum. Designed to appeal to all ages, it features hands-on exhibits that interpret and enhance understanding of Hawaii's cultural and natural history. A tall glass-encased solarium, for example, displays views of the Iao Valley with water flowing into touch pools that teem with native stream life. Community programs developed by the Hawaii Nature Center of Iao Valley include Nature Explorers'' for children aged five and older, and Incredible Insects'' and the Makiki Valley Hike'' for children aged seven and up. These two-and-a-half-hour programs focus on insects, moss, fungi, birds, soil, and plants, through outdoor activities. Parents may participate, too.

"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Showcase of the Island's Volcanic History","Established in 1916, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has provided visitors with a window into the Big Island's geothermal past for the better part of a century. On display here are the results of 70 million years of volcanic activity, migration, and evolution. The terrain ranges from lush rain forest to desolate igneous bedrock, and it includes miles of newly formed coastline created by lava flows. The park also varies in elevation from sea level to the summit of the world's most massive volcano - Mauna Loa - which rises to a height of 13,677 feet. Here at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, the current main attraction is an active volcano, Kilauea, which has been erupting continuously since 1983. It has been calculated that it pours out some 250,000 to 650,000 cubic yards of lava every day. Impressive plumes of steam rise up from the Pacific Ocean where the lava comes into contact with the cool water. At night, the red glow of molten rock can be seen from miles away. The Kilauea Iki Trail leads 3.3 miles around the rim of the volcano's crater and down 460 feet to its center. Sulfurous vapor still escapes from the cracks in the crater floor. The most active part of the volcano, the 1,320-foot-deep Halemaumau caldera, is closed to visitors, owing to its noxious fumes, but one of Kilauea's dormant vents - the Thurston Lava Tube - is accessible and well worth visiting for its eerie environs. Also located at the Kilauea Crater on its rim is Volcano House, the only guest lodgings located within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The original accommodations were built in 1846 when the U.S. Geological Survey Team was located here. Today, the hotel has 42 guest rooms, a dining room overlooking the smoldering caldera, and a welcoming fireplace whose embers have burned uninterrupted for over 135 years. More than half of the park has been designated wilderness, and it provides visitors with a number of unusual hiking and camping opportunities. Kipuka Puaulu, for example, is known as the Bird Park Trail,'' owing to the many species of birds that make this area their home. The 0.7-mile loop is a study in flora and fauna, having survived lava flows to provide refuge for native plants and animals. Another big attraction is the 18.3-mile Chain of Craters Road. As its name implies, it provides access to a number of craters that can be hiked and studied. It also leads to a site of ancient petroglyphs before terminating near the ocean where lava has enveloped the pavement. The Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs Field at mile marker 16.5 of the Chain of Craters Road features more than 23,000 carvings into the lava rock. They were made by natives and visitors to the area in the early 15th century, showing human forms, canoe sails, circles and other geometric patterns that chronicled their ancient lives. The Kilauea Visitor Center provides maps, brochures and short films to help visitors get the most out the park. It is located just beyond the gatehouse at Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96785. Just 96 miles from Kailua-Kona and 30 miles from Hilo, the park never closes, operating 24 hours a day, year round, although the Visitor Center's is open only from 7:45am to 5pm.

The water park features a variety of get-wet activities, including water slides, river rafting,'' a children's playground, and an adult spa, as well as a food court, gift shop, and luau lagoon. A single admission price allows access to all activities, plus use of inner tubes, lifejackets and lounge chairs. The original name of the park derives from one of its best-known attractions, the massive Hawaiian Waters wave pool. Filled with more than 400,000 gallons of water, it produces swells up to four feet high, that visitors can ride on their inner tubes or body surf to the paved shore. In its shallows, the ebb and flow of the waves is quite gentle, making for a very relaxing place to float and sun bathe. Throughout the summer months, movies are shown in the evenings beside the Hawaiian Waters pool, an event known a Dive `n' Movie. Private shaded cabanas are also located around the wave pool, providing guests with deck chairs, shade, a sun lounge and VIP food and beverage service. Cabana rentals are offered on a first come, first served basis at Davey Jones' Lockers. Another popular attraction is a water slide known as the Tornado. It shoots riders through a 130-foot tunnel into swirling waters and a splash pool. Other big draws are a slow-moving manmade river known as the Kapolei Kooler; an interactive children's area called Water World Playground, with fountains, water cannons, mini-slides and a dumping bucket; and the dual-slide Big Kahuna with its sloped flumes. Island Racer is a 240 foot raceway that launches riders down slides from a height of four stories (42 feet) at speeds of over 20 feet-per-second.

Da Flowrider offers a simulated surfing experience on a never-ending 40-foot-wde wave.

"Hawaiiana Hotel","Hawaii","Hawaiiana Hotel - Honolulu, Hawaii - Hotel with Traditional Waikiki Hospitality","Perhaps it is not so surprising that the Hawaiiana's location on Beach Walk is one of the area's earliest developments as well as its latest. This hotel has been around since 1955, making it one of Waikiki's oldest properties, and its neighbor, The Trump Tower Hotel, scheduled to open in November 2009, is its newest. As the gateway to Waikiki, Beach Walk has always been prime real estate. For more than half a century, the Hawaiiana Hotel has been greeting guests with Aloha Spirit.'' That's because the mission of this 93-room hotel is to provide a True Hawaiian'' experience to guests, and it does so with style. The first feature guests notice upon arrival is the legendary giant Tiki called Kukailimoku,'' which protects this gracious hotel. The landscaping reflects the lushness of Oahu's gardens. Slices of freshly cut pineapple are offered to each guest at check-in. In contrast to newer resorts, the Hawaiiana Hotel is low-rise, comprising five building, none of which extends beyond three stories. Every unit has its own kitchenette, with a microwave oven, toaster and tableware. Standard rooms have air conditioning, cable television, a clock radio and in-room safe, some with private balconies. Alii Deluxe Rooms have bathtubs in addition to showers, and the Kamehameha Studio comes equipped with its own Jacuzzi. All of the guest bathrooms are stocked with bath towels, face towels, hand towels, shampoo body soap, and hand soap. There are two freshwater outdoor swimming pools for relaxation and sunning, plus barbecue grills that can be used for entertaining upon request.

"Heeia Fishponds","Hawaii","Heeia Fishponds","The He'eia Fishponds are ancient fishponds located in He'eia, Oahu, and Ko'olaupoko. The He'eia Fishpond in Oahu is taken care of by the Paepae o He'eia nonprofit organization that takes care of the other two fishponds.

"Heiau","Hawaii","Heiau","Heiau is a Hawaiian temple in the literal translation. One of the Heiau of Hawaii is the Hale O Pi'lani Heiau in Hana on the island of Maui. There is also a Heiau on the Big Island of Hawaii. Heiau were made in different shapes to represent their purpose so it could be square, rounded or rectangular. Some even had towers. Many had earth terraces or stone platforms. Many of the Heiau are war temples such as the Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site.  There are two Heiau on the Big Island of Hawaii: the Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site and the Mookini Heiau State Monument. The Pu'ukohola is a stone Heiau on the north Kohala Coast. It is the largest restored temple of Hawaii. It was a Heiau for Kamehameha the Great. It was built as a dedication to the war god Kukailimoku. Kamehameha was advised by priests at this temple. The fortress was built between 1790 and 1791. The prophecy told by the priest at the temple was that Kamehameha would unite Hawaii. He did succeed in 1810, which is another reason for the temple to be so important to Hawaiian history that it was restored for visitors to see today."
"Highway Route 340","Hawaii","Highway Route 340 - Maui, Hawaii - Waterfront Shopping and Dining","Also known as the Kahekili Highway, Hawaii State Highway 340 is a rugged scenic route that extends for sixteen and a half miles along Maui's north shore. It runs north and south from Kahului through the small town of Waihee-Waiehu, flanked by the beauty of the West Maui Natural Area Reserve to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east, on its way to Kahakuloa Village, one of the most isolated spots on Maui. What makes this route special, however, are its many twists, turns and narrows, which can pose a challenge to even the most experienced drivers. The highway begins in the town of Kahului near Maui Community College at the intersection of Kaahumanu Avenue. It heads north through Kahului Harbor Park, with Kahului Bay to the right (east). North of town, the route is called Waiehu Beach Road, and it passes by Waiehu Beach Pavilion and Waihee Beach Park, two popular seaside recreational areas. Above Waihee-Waiehu, the route develops a series of snake-like curves, which continue all the way to Honokahua Bay. Along the way, there are several attractions, not the least of which is Camp Maluhia near mile marker 6.9. The Maui County Council of the Boy Scouts owns and manages this wilderness facility, where the panoramic ocean view is complemented by a quality summer camp experience for scout-aged boys. The camp is occupied 60 percent of the year and 95 percent of all weekends. A little farther along Highway 340 is the family-owned and operated Mendes Ranch. It offers horseback trail rides through the mountainous terrain and down to the coast. Riding lessons, outdoor weddings and special events can also be arranged at the ranch, in addition to two-hour morning and afternoon rides priced at $110 per person. Between the ranch and Kahakuloa Bay, the road is less well kept. The portions of the Kahekili Highway that are maintained by the county contain many one-lane stretches, often without reflectors or guardrails. Because the road is narrow and twisty, going is slow in places. In some stretches, the speed limits are posted at 15 miles per hour. At mile marker 7.5 westbound, there is only room for one car. Along the coastal side of the road, there is nothing to separate the pavement from the embankment. Falling rocks are a danger here as well. For this reason, driving at night or in poor visibility on Highway 340 is not recommended unless drivers are quite familiar with the road. In fact, the route can be so treacherous that some rental car agencies have been said to prohibit taking their vehicles here. Two more bottlenecks occur at mile markers 11.6 and 11.8. Traffic heading in either direction must yield so that cars can pass through the rock cuts. Then, Kahakuloa Head (also known as Pu'u Koae) juts out more than 600 feet toward the ocean overlooking Kahakuloa Bay and its village between mile markers 14 and 15. The views here are stunning and arguably worth the risk. Drivers should be advised that Kahakuloa Village has no gas stations, and the road forward is considerably longer than the road back. Continuing west from the town, the highway rises for one and a half more miles of narrow curves and breathtaking scenery. At mile marker 16.5 the Kahekili Highway joins the Honoapiilani Highway, also known as State Route 30. The pavement is much improved here. Four miles further on is a rest area and a hiking trail that leads to the Nakalele Blowhole, one of Maui's most famous natural attractions. The site can also be reached by taking the long way around on Route 30 from Kahului, which - given the slowness of the drive on Highway 340 - takes about the same amount of time."

"Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort & Spa","Hawaii","Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort & Spa - Honolulu, Hawaii - Enduring Waikiki Resort","The Hilton Hawaiian Village was developed on the site of the old Niumalu Hotel at the west end of Waikiki Beach, where the white sands reach their widest point. It began in 1955 as a group of thatched-roof cottages, housing 70 guest rooms and suites. The Tapa Room, gardens and three swimming pools were also completed, giving the resort an upscale native-village look. The plan, however, was always to create a cluster of skyscraper hotels - a self-contained urban village, where guests would feel at home and the culture of Hawaii could be showcased. Today, the complex has grown to cover 22 oceanfront acres, encompassing twenty restaurants and lounges, 90 shops, a beachfront lagoon, 500 palm trees, five pools, waterfalls, gardens, an art collection and exotic wildlife, such as flamingos, swans and eight African black-foot penguins. Some 2,860 guest rooms, suites, condominiums and apartments are contained in the Village's seven lofty towers. Landmark among these is the 31-story Rainbow Tower, facing the beach and opened in 1968. It features the world's largest ceramic-tile mosaic, 286 feet high by 26 feet wide, using more than 16,000 colorful tesserae. The six other towers, in order of construction, are: the 14-story Ali`i Tower built in 1957 and renovated in 1987; the 17-story Diamond Head Tower opened in 1960; the 25-story Lagoon Tower Apartments finished in 1965; the 1982 Tapa Tower at 35 stories, the 25-story Kalia Tower completed in 2001, and the new 39-story timeshare Grand Waikikian Tower, opened in 2009.

There is a main trail head where many cars are often parked. It is on the left side of the road. There is an old gate to provide visitors access to the dirt road that will lead one to the falls. Actually, there are quite a few trails that visitors can come across from the main trail head to see Ho'opi'I Falls just follow the markers available. Some of the other trails are fairly steep. There are two falls along the way where visitors can stop. The lower falls are not as amazing as the upper falls. Some individuals will jump from the rocks into the pool below, which is deep enough if one jump towards the middle and feet first. It is not a place for cliff diving. As long as visitors remain on the trails they will not enter anyone's yards or private property. The public trail is the easiest path up to the falls and private property is marked clearly."

Hualalai at a height of 1,300 feet, tiny Holualoa Village is a historic site, where retailers, farmers and artisans have gathered to create a unique cultural enclave. Members of the Holualoa Village Association have set up galleries, cafys, inns and crafts shops in over two dozen historic buildings from Hawaii's past. They also organize annual events that draw crowds of locals and tourists alike. Surrounding Holualoa Village are Kona coffee farms. It was the coffee industry that first drew settlers to this area and caused the old buildings to be erected. From Dr. Nakamaru's old dentist office to Tom Gouveia's butcher shop and the old Holualoa Theater, these structures are a testament to Hawaii's plantation past. Historic photos and information have been posted within the buildings to help visitors understand their roles and importance over time. While strolling through Holualoa Village, visitors will immediately sense the relaxed upcountry lifestyle that pervades the community. Life goes at a slower pace here. Priorities are focused on the here and now. Each year, the Holualoa Village Association conducts a Summer Farmfest and Ukulele Jam.'' Shop owners host local farmers for a huge open market, selling vegetables, fruit, flowers, cheeses, eggs, fresh baked goods and more. Tents are set up, and ukulele music fills the air. There is dancing, too, as local groups perform in the street. Another annual attraction is the Holualoa Village Coffee and Art Stroll.'' Since 1998, this event has been held on the first Saturday in November, offering free samples of over 30 different local coffees from West Hawaii farmers. Some 2,000 visitors attend, walking through the center of the village, browsing the galleries, listening to a capella tunes, and enjoying the fresh mountain air. Each December, the entire village lights up and a special Christmas Tree is set up in front of the old Public Library for the Music and Light Festival.'' Singing and ukulele music fill the air, as everyone embraces the holiday spirit. There are free bounce houses'' for children. Vendors offer hotdogs, pupus, cotton candy, and face painting.

Apart from the annual events, Holualoa Village merchants conduct a weekly farmers' market each Saturday. Art studios specialize year-round in woodworking, oil painting, home furnishings, fine prints, ceramics, photography, gourd craft, shell work, and more. And there is coffee - lots and lots of fresh coffee - in the small cafys and numerous mill shops around the village. Other local businesses include a holistic health center, a gift store, and three cozy bed and breakfasts: The Orchid Inn, the Hale Maluhia Country Inn, and the Holualoa Inn. The latter is actually a more of a boutique hotel, combining the tranquility of a private coffee estate with all the amenities of a Polynesian retreat.

The walk from Napili Bay to Honokeana Bay is 350 yards. The bay can be slightly difficult to find from the road.  Honokeana Bay is a local hangout, though tourists also manage to find their way there. The bay is great for watching the waves roll in or enjoying snorkeling with sea turtles. The turtles are not to be disturbed in any way even if they come up to you. The bay is rockier beach than sandy beach, which makes exit and entrance into the water more difficult. The bay is not considered suitable for children or others with mobility problems. There are times the waters will be calm, but also times the currents can be stronger. It is best to only swim in the ocean when it is calm especially because of the rocky shoreline. Even the smaller waves can be difficult to handle, which is why the water needs to be calm for swimming and exiting. The bay does have a few locations for picnicking and enjoying the various sites from the beach."

The marina and beach area are perfect for seeing Hawaiian tropical fishes and coral. The area is often un-crowded with crystal clear water. It is not everything that some of the other dive and snorkeling locations are, but it is certainly worth a visit for the un-crowded area.  There is also a sanctuary where green sea turtles come to bask. At the right time of day you can see the sea turtles in the sun, as well as heading back towards the water. As a sanctuary it is not appropriate to interfere with the sea turtles at all. There is a sign that asks visitors to stay 20 feet away or penalties and even jail could result. The turtles do sometimes swim up to visitors who are swimming or snorkeling, which is fine as long as you do not interfere."

In doing so, it has created an encyclopedic museum, state-of-the-art galleries and an Art Center at Linekona, the state's largest private art school. Cookes' personal art collection provided the starting point. She also donated her family's land on Beretania Street land for the museum, coupled a $25,000 endowment. Steadily growing in both acquisitions and stature, the Academy now ranks among the finest in America. It added a library in 1956, the education wing in 1960, and a gift shop in 1965. The caf, opened in 1969. In 1977, expansion included the contemporary gallery, administrative offices and a 280-seat theater. An art center for studio classes and expanded educational programming began activities in 1989.

While inter-island connections can be had at other locations, travelers from the mainland or from international destinations touch down in Honolulu. More than 21 million passengers arrive annually, and the rising traffic through the area for cargo and passengers caused the airport to launch a new renovation project in 2006. The renovations are expected to take nearly 12 years to complete. Already a massive complex, the facilities will be upgraded and expanded. The airport was in fairly good condition, as it was completely taken over by the Navy following the Pearl Harbour attack. The government transformed it into the largest airport in the US at the time, and it had seven different runways. The Hickam Air Force Base installation is what remains of the former Naval Air Station Honolulu. Currently, Honolulu International Airport / Hickam AFB use four runways for ground planes, with an additional two offshore runways available for sea plane landings. There are three terminals at the airport, and while people movers have been discussed, the terminals are currently serviced by the WikiWikiBuses. Trivia buffs and kids will like that WikiWiki means fast'' in Hawaiian, although there is some debate if the buses truly merit their name. There are three routes from the local TheBus'' lines that serve the airport. As the main overseas terminal is the first part of the airport to get upgraded, stop locations are being moved about a bit, so check carefully to make sure you get off and on at the best spots. Short term parking is also being expanded, however there is a cell phone lot for quick pick ups and drop offs.

"Honolulu Screamer","Hawaii","Honolulu Screamer - Honolulu, Hawaii - Powerful Jet Boat for Extreme Sightseeing","Hawaii's fastest thrill ride, The Honolulu Screamer, is a colorful, twin jet, water propelled jet boat. It zooms across the water off the coast of Waikiki at speeds up to 40 mils per hour, carrying up to four dozen passengers. The Screamer is powered by 1,420 horsepower, twin diesel Caterpillar engines. To enhance the experience of twisting and turning at high velocity, the crew cranks up the sound on a 20-speaker audio system that booms out music heard all the way to the beach as it whizzes by. Launched on October 6, 2006, the Honolulu Screamer was the brainchild of proprietor Greg Longnecker. The colossal speedboat cost him over a million dollars and took nearly two years to build at a shipyard in New Jersey. A great gaping mouth full of sharp teeth has been painted on its prow, making it resemble an angry green sea monster as it cuts through the waves. Those who book a ride on the Honolulu Screamer get 45 uninterrupted minutes of turbo-charged sightseeing, rocketing east past Waikiki Beach to Diamond Head and back again to port near Ala Moana Beach Park. Yet even while weaving and spinning at high speeds, passengers may catch a glimpse of Hawaiian green sea turtles, spinner dolphins, and Humpback whales. For those who need an even greater thrill, the Honolulu Screamer also offers Oahu parasailing. For example, the package called X-Treme Parasail / Standard Ride includes a line length of up to 700 feet, so that the parasailer reaches an altitude of 350 feet. That is equivalent to flying off the 35th floor of a hotel. The parasailing experience includes equipment rental, an orientation by a qualified instructor and two full hours aboard the Honolulu Screamer. The duration of the flight is 8~10 minutes. Accompanying, non-parasailing friends or family may book the ride as observers. Owing to the high speed at which the Screamer travels, certain safety precautions and restrictions apply. All passengers must be at least 40'' (102cm) tall to ride, and those with heart conditions, back injuries, or women who are pregnant are prohibited from embarkation. No smoking, food or drink is allowed on board. The Honolulu Screamer has been approved and certified by the United States Coast Guard to carry up to 49 passengers. Life-vests are provided for everyone's safety. After boarding, passengers must be seated, and children must be able to remain in their seats without assistance. It is strongly advised to hold on to hats, sunglasses, and any other items that might be blown away while the Screamer is in motion. Passengers should also be aware that they can expect to get wet during the circuit.

"Hualalai","Hawaii","Hualalai","The Big Island of Hawaii was formed entirely by volcanic activity. There are five separate volcanoes on the Island. One of those is Hualalai. Hualalai is part of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park Island of Hawaii. This volcano is on the western side of the Big Island and is the third youngest volcano. It is also the third most active volcano on the island.  It was most active in the 1700s. In fact six different vents erupted with lava during that century. Two of the vents produced lava flows that went as far as the sea. The Kona International Airport was built on the larger of the two lava flows. There are several homes, businesses and roads that go up the flows of Hualalai. It is a bit worrisome that all of this has been built up when the volcano is still active. It is said that in the next 100 years the volcano will most likely erupt again, which would cause a lot of devastation to the homes, businesses and roads maintained today. The oldest volcano on the Big Island is Kohala, which emerged from the sea roughly 500,000 years ago. All of the volcanoes can be seen during hikes of the national park."
"Hualalai Golf Club, Nicklaus Course, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii - The First Jack Nicklaus-Designed Course on Hawaii","Hawaii","Hualalai Golf Club, Nicklaus Course, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii - The First Jack Nicklaus-Designed Course on Hawaii","The Hualalai Golf Course was the first Jack Nicklaus-designed course on Hawaii and, according to Nicklaus, his inspiration for the design came from the native lava. Nicklaus used the ups and downs he found there, as well as the influence of the ocean, to create what is described as a spectacular playing field.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course plays 7,117 yards from the championship tees, with a USGA rating of 73.7 and a slope rating of 139. Golfers will begin by playing through a lush kipuka (oasis), then follow a layout of vibrant-green fairways sculpted against a backdrop of black lava rock. The course then finds its way back to the ocean, with finishing holes that deliver on the expected beauty, difficulty and drama of direct seaside golf. The couse, which is the home of the PGA Champions Tour Mitsubishi Electric Championship at Hualalai, features a number of noteworthy holes. The par-3 No. 12 is a rush and a challenge for just about any golfer, as the hole features something you just don't see everyday: an expansive, contoured green with a deep, intimidating bunker right at its heart. Hole No. 17 is Hualalai's signature hole, and the layout features a green that actually touches the ocean. Another noteworthy hole is the par-3 No. 5, which is considered the most difficult hole on the course. Playing toward the mountain, an elevated tee looks down upon a picturesque hole with a number of water hazards. When explaining his theory of course design, Nicklaus likened it to painting on a canvas'' with some good golf shots included, and that sums up the Nicklaus Course. Golf facilities include a driving range, putting green, and pro shop with club rental. Golf instruction is also available. The course also features a clubhouse that serves up tropical refreshments at the Hualalai Grille, as well as beautiful views of the ocean. The Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Ka'upulehu is a reflection of the nature all around it. Making use of materials indigenous to Hawaii, such as bamboo, rattan and lava rock, the resort has received numerous honors and awards. It was voted No. 12 among the World's Top 100 Resorts in the 2006 Travel & Leisure Reader's Poll, and ranks among the World's Top Resorts, Top Rooms, Top Services, Top Facilities and Top Destination Spas in the Zagat Survey 2007-2008. The resort features the 15,000-square-foot Hualalai Sports Club for fitness training, which also includes a whirlpool, sauna and steam room.

"Hulopoe Beach","Hawaii","Hulopoe Beach","Hulopoe Beach was once called Pineapple Island. This was due to the fruit grown by Dole Company for several decades. Lanai, Hawaii and the beach is considered a secluded vacation destination. Hulopoe Beach Park offers a large white sandy beach with Hulopoe Bay. The shoreline is a bit steep, which makes it good for swimming. It is also one of the best snorkeling sites in Hawaii. Many tropical fish tend to visit the bay. There is also a good amount of clear water days to see the fish.  Hulopoe Bay is considered a marine life conservation district meaning fishing is limited to hook and line from the shore only. Hulopoe Beach is not as popular as some of the other easier to reach beaches. It means you can enjoy some romance and quiet. There are plenty of trees for shade during the day too. Most visitors enjoy sunbathing, swimming, snorkeling, and impromptu volleyball games. There are no facilities on site according to the data found about the beach. Some resorts are nearby, but there is plenty of beach area to avoid some of the more populated sections close to the hotels on the island of Hawaii."

Lanai, the 6th largest island of the Hawaiian chain, is fairly undeveloped with two resort areas and a total of some 3,000 residents inhabiting its 141 square miles of surface area. There is an airport at Lanai City and there is also a ferry that departs from the Island of Maui and arrives here on the southern coast. The ferry ride last between 30 and 45 minutes. There are also tour boats from Maui as well. The protected bay of Hulopoe attracts visitors interested in snorkeling, body surfing and swimming. There also numerous tide pools carved from volcanic rock that can be explored here. The water gets rough in the winter months as it does throughout most of the Hawaiian Islands. Admission to this Beach Park is free of charge. The park has restrooms and showers, as well as picnic tables with adjacent barbecue facilities with grills at each table. Hulopoe, Hawaii is often visited by Humpback Whales passing off the coast in the winter months and throughout the year dolphins have been seen here. The large tide pools here are found at the bay's eastern end. Fluctuating water levels deposit these pools in rocky shore areas. Small life forms deposited with the sea waters adapt to the environment and make it their home. There is a Four Seasons Hotel located right here. Non-guests must bring their own snorkeling equipment as there are no rentals available to the general public. The only food available for purchase here is at the restaurants located in the hotel. No ships are allowed to dock in the protected waters here so as not to disturb Sea Turtles or the Spinner Dolphin, which are regularly found in these waters. Just to the left of Hulopoe Beach is Shark's Bay with its characteristic red lava rock where swimming is ill advised due to the rock formations in the sea as well as on land. At Hulopoe, Hawaii, to the contrary, swimming, snorkeling and surfing are all quite popular. A two mile hiking and fishing trail departs from here as well, traveling along the cliffs of a nearby private golf course. There is a 140 ft. elevation gain along this trail from Hulopoe Beach. Historical sites that date to ancient times can be seen along this trail as well as views of porpoises. The trail accesses various well reviewed fishing spots. The trail from Hulopoe ends at Huwai Gulch. This beach has been named among the nation's ten best by Dr. Stephen P. Leatherman, a Florida International University Professor known as Dr. Beach.''

The address of the Heiau is Highway 450 close to mile marker 16. A Heiau is an ancient place of worship usually in the form of a temple. Hawaiians used them on many islands, sometimes living at the temples or around the temples. Iii'ili'opae was considered a place for sorcerers who would learn how to sacrifice. In this particular case it was human sacrifice. It is the reason the school is called the Schools of Sacrifice.  All that is left of this Heiau is a 320x 120 foot field of stones. Historians have often researched this temple and believe it used to be three times the size that one sees today from the stone field. The ruins are all that remain, which date back to the 13th century. It was considered one of the largest and oldest on the island. The location puts it on the shore overlooking the sea which meant those living at the temple could see anyone arriving. Since the Heiau is on a private island permission is needed to visit the temple. Visitors may not walk on the left over Heiau or take any souvenir."
"Ilikai Hotel & Suites","Hawaii","Ilikai Hotel & Suites - Honolulu, Hawaii - Original Icon at the Head of Waikiki","First opened for business in 1964, the Ilikai Hotel & Suites has the distinction of being positioned at the entrance'' to Waikiki. It overlooks the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, within easy walking distance of both Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Beach Park. Most local residents associate the 26-story Ilikai with the popular television series Hawaii Five-O,''' which was frequently filmed here. In fact, actor Jack Lord stood on the penthouse balcony overlooking Waikiki Beach for the panoramic shot that opened every episode of the hit TV show. The hotel helped popularize the famous beach, which in turn spurred mass tourism to Hawaii. The Ilikai's original developer, Chinn Ho, sold the property for $35 million in 1974. More recently, ownership was claimed by local developer Brian Anderson, who paid $218 million for it in July 2006. By that time, most of the space in the 1,009-unit building was privately own as condominiums and time-shares - 806 of them in all. Anderson's plan was to renovate the Ilikai at a cost of $60 million, bringing its aging rooms on par with more recent Waikiki developments. It was to be an upscale condominium hotel, with 343 hotel rooms, new commercial areas and an expanded parking garage. The Ilikai became a member of the Aqua Hotel and Resorts chain and was put under the operation of Hawaii Hotel Management LLC. However, the hotel never stopped losing money. It experienced continued financial difficulties in competition with its more modern neighbors and eventually went into bankruptcy. The 203-room, 16-commercial-space hotel operation was purchased at a foreclosure auction in May 2009 by iStar FM Loans LLC, a subsidiary of New York-based iStar Financial Inc., for $51 million. The Ilikai Hotel was subsequently closed by iStar in July 2009, putting some 150 employees out of work. The condominium and time-share portion of the Ilikai remained open, however, and Aqua Hotels & Resorts has continued to take bookings through its web site, with the option to move guests to affiliated properties should the Ilikai's rooms not be available. Those who are able to place reservations will find that the one- and two-bedroom units are quite spacious, as was the custom with old Waikiki resorts, ranging from 600 to 1,187 square feet of living space. They come with full lanais, in-room refrigerators and coffeemakers or full kitchens. Guests have access to a large fitness center, a special bather's elevator, a business center, gift shop, hair salon, the outdoor swimming pool and sundeck, and an open-air courtyard Sarento's Top of the I'' Italian Restaurant serves dinner here nightly from 5:30pm to 9pm Sunday through Thursday, and until 9:30pm on Friday and Saturday. Its bar is open for cocktails till 11pm or midnight. Given its prime real estate, the Ilikai is unlikely to remain shuttered as a hotel for very long. The only drawback it has ever had is being a long walk from attractions in central Waikiki, but it has always more than made up for that inconvenience with its spectacular views of the beach and Diamond Head in the distance. The address is 1777 Ala Moana Blvd, Honolulu HI 96814."
"Ilima Hotel","Hawaii","Ilima Hotel - Honolulu, Hawaii - A Curiously Cultural Waikiki Condo Hotel","Established in 1995, the Ilima Hotel is something of a curiosity in Waikiki. Unlike most of the huge high-rise resorts that surround it, this 17-story property with 98 condominium-style rooms is family owned and operated. What makes it truly unique, however, is a singular fixation on Hawaiian culture. The hotel began offering its staff members a Hawaiian studies program right from the very start. Each employee is expected to take classes in local crafts and culture, such as Hawaiian history, music, hula, traditions, values, and arts. The lessons are taught by some of the Islands' most skilled practitioners. These studies frequently include field trips to museums, historic sites, and tourist attractions. The goal is to enhance the staff's knowledge of the Islands. Although hotel guests sometimes join in, the program is distinct from other cultural programs in that employees are the focus, not visitors. Management believes that their mission is to incorporate Hawaiian values into our daily business practices, making Hawaiian culture a natural part of our guests' and employees' experience at the hotel.'' Not surprisingly, these efforts won the Ilima Hotel a major prize in 2007 - the Hawaii Tourism Authority's Keep It Hawaii'' Kahili Award. Rich koa wood has been used to decorate the lobby of the Ilima Hotel. The staff is especially proud of the series of Hawaiian paintings on display here, including artwork depicting Hawaii's mythical heroes and gods. In one painting, mortal Lohi'au woos the goddess Hi'iaka, while a jealous fire goddess, Pele, surrounds them with her flames. In another, Lohi'au and Hi'iaka are shown riding through eternity in a magical seashell. Other motifs show the gods Kane and Kanaloa bearing life that flows from the Earth as a spring and the god Maui trying to lengthen the day by catching and slowing the sun. And a particularly large mural portrays the immortals Ku and Hina swimming in a sea of eternal bliss. Every Friday at 11:30am, a group of Ilima Hotel hosts performs a selection of Hawaiian songs in the lobby. The Ilima Ohana Chorus can be heard rehearsing once a week, too, and they are very, very good. In 2002 they won First Place in the Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association's Hospitality Industry Song Contest. Not to be missed are the Ilima Hotel's monthly birthday celebrations that feature leis, cards and cake for hosts as well as guests. Occasionally, poolside gatherings are arranged so that guests and hosts can enjoy live Hawaiian entertainment together.

"Imiloa Astronomy Center","Hawaii","Imiloa Astronomy Center - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Planetarium with a Focus on Education","Opened on February 23, 2006, as part of the University of Hawaii at Hilo's Science and Technology Park campus, the Imiloa Astronomy Center occupies more than nine acres of land overlooking Hilo Bay. It features a full-dome planetarium and more than 100 exhibits in its 12,000-square-foot gallery, weaving information on astronomy with Hawaiian heritage. According to Executive Director Peter B. Giles, the mission of the Imiloa Astronomy Center is to celebrate Hawaiian culture and Mauna Kea astronomy (in order) to share an inspiring example of how science and culture can be united to advance knowledge, understanding and opportunity.'' Its name comes from the Hawaiian word imiloa, which means to explore or to seek profound truth.'' Many of the exhibits focus on connections between early Polynesian star navigators and present-day astronomers. The Voyaging Exhibit, for example, displays a one-fifth scale model of a Hokualakai canoe along with a modern canoe, symbolizing the continuing journey to preserve Hawaiian language and culture. Showcased at the Imiloa Astronomy Center are examples of the research being conducted by astronomers at the Mauna Kea Observatories, where 13 huge telescopes have been mounted upon the island's highest peak. One exhibit is called 4D2U Voyage Through Space.'' Requiring visitors to wear 3D glasses, it shows a stunning representation of time and space based upon real observational data and computer simulations from the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea. The Center also has its own planetarium for digital projections of the heavens, including a special feature called Mauna Kea: Between Earth and Sky.'' It is reportedly the first full-dome planetarium to have stereo 3D capability. Apart from its collections of knowledge and history, the Imiloa Astronomy Center is also aesthetically pleasing. Its award-winning design features unique titanium cones as its primary vestibules. The landscaping offers one of the largest and most diverse collections of native and Hawaiian canoe'' plants found in the islands - more than 50 native, indigenous and Polynesian-introduced plants in total. What's more, the facilities were built with 75% recycled materials, earning LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. For dining inside the Center, visitors will find the Sky Garden Restaurant. Its ceiling-to-floor glass walls provide a panoramic view of Hilo Bay. It is open to the public each Tuesday through Sunday from 7am to 4pm, serving breakfast and lunch. It is open for dinner from 5pm to 8pm on Thursday through Sunday. The restaurant space, with a capacity for 90 people, is also available for business events, weddings, dinner parties and other functions.

"Iolani Bandstand","Hawaii","Iolani Bandstand","Iolani Bandstand was once the coronation stand for King Kalakaua. The bandstand is located in Honolulu on the Island of Oahu, Hawaii. The bandstand is located on the Iolani Palace Grounds. It was first located at the front entrance to the palace and connected by a bridge. However, it was later moved.  The structure was moved to the current location in order to preserve and restore the rounded structure. It has retained its original form. It is a large gazebo structure with domed roof of green tiles. It has various flags of nations including Japan. As a rounded structure it has a covering for the band with stairs leading up. There is also an underneath area. This area can be reached from above ground by taking stairs and entering the door. The new location still retains the underneath section. Though Hawaii is now a part of the US the history of the Islands and its Kingdom are not lost. The Iolani Bandstand is proof of that. The structure turned into a bandstand when it was restored. Today the Royal Hawaiian Band performs at the bandstand when weather permits. Often this is on Fridays at noon."
"Iolani Palace","Hawaii","Iolani Palace - Honolulu, Hawaii - National Treasure and Home to Hawaiian Royalty","Built in 1882 by the last King of Hawaii, King David Kalakaua, the Iolani Palace is a testament to the islands' past monarchy. It was the seat of government and the only official state residence of royalty ever established in the United States. While the sovereignty of the Kingdom lasted, this was the center of Hawaiian social and political activity. The last royal to live in the Palace was the King's sister and successor, Queen Lili`uokalani. She made this her home until the monarchy was overthrown in 1893. She was later charged with sedition and imprisoned here for eight months in 1895. Until 1969, Iolani Palace served as the capitol of the Provisional Government, Republic, Territory and State of Hawaii. It was subsequently vacated and underwent restoration to turn it into a museum. Today, the Palace serves as a reminder of the grandeur of the past and Hawaiian history and heritage. Formally declared as a National Historic Landmark, it operates under the direction of the nonprofit Friends of Iolani Palace. Following meticulously restoration efforts, its first and second floors have been open to the public for guided tours since the 1970s. On the ground level are public reception areas, including the Grand Hall, which runs the entire breadth of the Palace. Also found here are the State Dining Room, smaller reception rooms, and the crimson and gold Throne Room. The second level has private rooms, such as the King's and Queen's suites, the Music Room, the Princesses' chambers and the Imprisonment Room. It is easy to imagine visiting diplomats, artisans, sportsmen, and entertainers meeting here. Staircases made of native woods, paintings of Hawaiian kings and queens, priceless vases and statues, ornately carved sliding doors, massive Davenport sideboards, a portrait of King Louis Philippe of France, and sturdy mahogany furnishings are just a few of the artifacts on display. The land on which Iolani Palace stands in downtown Honolulu also has historic significance. It was once the site of an ancient heiau (place of worship). The entire area was originally enclosed by an eight-foot high coral block wall with wooden gates, lowered to 3'6''in 1891 and topped with the current iron fence. The four main gates display the Coat of Arms of the Hawaiian Kingdom, and each served a special purpose for ceremonies, tradesmen, servants and private use of the royals. A royal tomb area is located in the southeast Palace grounds. The Halekoa, or Iolani Barracks where the Royal Guard was based, now houses the museum ticket office, the Palace Shop, and a video theater. Iolani Palace is open to the public for guided tours, audio tours and gallery tours, as well as special community events. Hours are 9am to 5pm, Tuesdays through Saturdays, with admission ranging from $6 to $20 for adults, and discounts available for children, locals, seniors and military personnel. On Kama'aina Sundays, the facilities are open to the community free of charge, and on most Fridays, the Royal Hawaiian Band performs free concerts on Palace grounds. Iolani Palace is located in at the corner of King and Richards Streets in the downtown Honolulu. The vehicular entrance is via Likelike Mall, just off King Street, between the Palace and the Hawaii State Library."

"Island of Molokini","Hawaii","Island of Molokini","The Island of Molokini is a crescent shaped island near Maui, Hawaii. It is an island formed from a partially sunken volcanic crater. It is what allows the Alalakeiki Channel to form between the island and Maui.  Molokini has 23 acres with a diameter of .4 miles. It is 2.5 miles west of Makena State Park and south from Ma'alaea Bay. The Island is not habitable considering its size and location. Over time it may eventually become a completely sunken crater; however, for now the island is used for dive boat mooring as it is one of the top out of 10 dive spots in the world. Scuba, snuba, and snorkeling are all possible. The islet or Island of Molokini is a seabird sanctuary protected by the state of Hawaii. Mythology states that Molokini was a beautiful woman. Pele and she were in love with the same man. Pele turned her rival into stone, which is why the Pu'u Olai or cinder stone on Makena Beach is considered the woman's head. Sadly, during World War II the island was used for target practice because the shape was similar to battleships. Unexploded munitions were found in the crater and finally detonated between 1975 and 1984. In 2006 a survey ruled the area clean and it is slowly healing from the damage enough to be a top dive spot in the world with beautiful sea life."
"James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge","Hawaii","James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge","The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge is on the northern most point of Oahu on the North Shore.

The two wetlands include the James Campbell Refuge, the Punamano Unite and Ki'I Unit. The Ki'I Unit is 126 acres while the Punamano Unit is 134 acres. The James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge was expanded in 2005 to include 1,100 acres. It has wetlands as well as the last intact coastal dune system on Oahu. The expansion came from many donations and many generations who have worked to protect Hawaii's birds. Shorebirds and migratory birds are protected on the land. About 2 miles of the land encompasses the dunes and strand of vegetation where the Hawaiian Monk Seal usually nests. There is also a habitat for green turtles. The turtles like many of the birds are endangered. Also found at the refuge are the Hawaiian Owl and Damselfly."

"Judd Trail","Hawaii","Judd Trail","Judd Trail in Oahu is one of the shorter trails in the city. It is .75 miles in length with an elevation change of 200 feet at most. It is considered to be in the wet valley terrain meaning that the floor of the trail can be wet and a bit slippery at some points. There is a parking area near a stream at the beginning of the Judd trailhead. The stream will need to be crossed so caution is recommended. The rocks tend to be slippery and unstable. After getting across the stream the trail will begin. It does loop back so it is a one direction trail rather than having to return the way one comes. Along the trail visitors can expect to see eucalyptus, ironwood, and bamboo forests.  For a longer hike visitors can take the Nu'uanu Trail which connects to the Judd loop about midway through. To find the trail head go from Honolulu on Pali Highway and turn on to Nu'unau Pali Drive where there is a concrete bridge. There is a right into a parking area lined with ironwood trees.

This resort area is located less than 15 minutes from the Kapalua West Maui Airport and one hour from the main airport on Maui which is found at Kahului. In 1957 the owners of the Pioneer Sugar Mill located here chose to transform the seaside cane fields into a luxury tourist area. All that was here was a small wharf and short rail line from the mill in Lahaina. The old Sugar Cane Train still runs between Kaanapali, Hawaii and Lahaina as a tourist attraction. This was one of the first places where locations were created out of the jungles or plantations with the explicit end of creating a hub of luxury tourism. Six years later the first hotel opened on the white, sand beaches, followed rapidly by others but it was not for decades that this became a popular destination. Today, more than a half a million visitors come here every year. There are two large golf courses here; both are found at the Kaanapali Golf Resort. A mall is found here as well, Whalers Village, which is home to over 90 shops and principally caters to the resort area guests and residents.

"Kahala Beach","Hawaii","Kahala Beach","Kahala Beach provides access to the ocean for those who would like to swim or surf. The beach is fairly small with a thin strip of sand in the Kahala neighborhood of Oahu. This is a more upscale area of the island. The beach offers plenty of trees for shade. Often the water is more like glass without too many waves, though this does depend on the day and season. It is shallow in this area allowing for snorkeling to see the coral.  From the beach one can stroll towards Waialae Beach Park or head across the bridge to Kahala Resort Beach. There are covered picnic areas, lawns with palms and a lagoon with dolphins. When hunger takes its toll consider walking from Kahala Beach to Hunakai Street and up to Kilauea Avenue. This brings visitors to the Kahala Mall as well as restaurants like Yen King. There are a variety of choices in this area just steps from the beach. Visitors can then return to the beach for more sunbathing and swimming after a meal. The beach is open for evening strolls under the moonlight or for exercise during the day. Facilities are available."
"Kahaluu Beach","Hawaii","Kahaluu Beach - Keauhou, Big Island, Hawaii - Public Beach for Snorkeling and Surfing","Also known as Snorkel Beach,'' Kahaluu is one of the best spots for diving and underwater adventures on the Big Island. The calm waters are filled with coral in vibrant hues, fascinating volcanic rock formations, and more than a hundred species of fish. The small bay that Kahaluu Beach faces is also noted for surfing, featuring three different layers of cresting waves that stretch out over natural reefs just past the tranquil lagoon. According to historical records, King Kamehameha himself is responsible for this fine venue that tourists and locals now enjoy. Wanting to create a safe haven for his family to enjoy the ocean, away from the beaches with dangerous surf and riptides, he selected Kahaluu Bay and had workers construct a semicircular, 3,900-foot-long offshore seawall that would protect the small cove here. Today, the area is known as Kahaluu Beach Park. It was originally maintained by the County of Hawaii under lease from then-owner Bishop Estate, starting in 1953. Later, in 1966, the property was deeded over to the local government and dedicated as a permanent public beach park for the use of Kona residents. The beach area itself is a dark strip of salt-and-pepper colored sand, surrounded by an abundance of shady trees. It is not as wide as many beaches used for seaside recreation, but it makes up for it with its unique aquatic attributes. The lagoon is fed by a fresh water spring that pours in up to 10 million gallons per day. This makes visibility excellent and attracts a wide variety of ocean life, including huge schools of fish and federally protected green sea turtles. Snorkelers can enter the water where the sand slopes down to the water at the north end of the beach. A journey to the coral reef, which extends over 25 acres, starts by swimming against the current southwest toward the lava rock breakwater. Past the ruins of the old seawall, the shallows of the reef attract tropical fish, including large parrot fish, puffer fish, and butterfly fish. They gather in groups so large that they resemble huge, colorful living clouds. The north end of the beach is also where the waves beckon, and both body boarding and surfing are possible. The first surf breaks just past the snorkeling lagoon forming a beginner's wave. Waves that tube and peel can be caught further out by intermediate surfers. And the outer reef is the place for longboarding, with high peaking surf and full-faced slopes that experienced wave-riders treasure. Other attractions near Kahaluu Beach include St. Peter's Catholic Church and the Ku'emanu Heiau, a sacred site where chiefs once prayed for good surfing conditions. There is also a stagnant pond called Waiku'i that was once filled with freshwater and used for rinsing off after surfing. More recently, showers have been installed at the beach, along with other modern conveniences: picnic pavilions, restrooms, drinking water, a lifeguard tower, and a small parking area. Kahaluu Beach is located at mile marker #4.8 on Ali'i Drive, Keauhou, Hawaii 96739. It is about a 20-minute drive from Kona Airport."
"Kahana Bay Beach Park","Hawaii","Kahana Bay Beach Park","Kahana Bay Beach Park offers a view of the ocean and the Koolau Mountains. In fact the Oahu bay is surrounded on three sides by the Koolau Mountains. It is a wonderful attraction on the windward side of the island that most tourists tend to miss. For those who are willing to travel to this area it is possible to enjoy the quiet beach and park offerings.  The bay is crescent shaped with beach pines and the mountains for a little trekking should one desire to. The beach is made of golden sand allowing for comfortable sunbathing. For a break the pines provide plenty of shade. There is a natural fishpond that goes into Kahana Stream. It can be the best place for a picnic and barbeque. The hikes along the mountains are somewhat strenuous depending on the path taken as it tends to be a steeper area, but there are plenty of stops and lookouts along the way. The water is usually calm for a dip in the ocean after a hike. It is also safe to swim in though during June to September there can be stinging seaweed about. There are no concession stands for drinking water or food."
"Kahanu Garden","Hawaii","Kahanu Garden","Kahanu Garden runs along the Hana coast of Maui, Hawaii. It is on the eastern section of the Hawaiian island. The garden grows in isolation meaning that it is untamed by humans and is considered one of the largest native hala forests in the Hawaiian strand. Hala is also Pandanus.  Plants collected from many Pacific Islands have landed here and grow. These plants are valued by the Hawaiian people as well as other cultures. For example the Polynesians, Melanesians, and Micronesians all value many of the plant species that grow in Kahanu Garden. At Kahanu visitors can learn about the different cultures and relationships between people and plants. Some of the plants were transported to the garden when visitors traveled there by canoes and other vessels. It is one of the most unique collections of ethnobotanical existence in the world. Breadfruit cultivars serve as germplasm for many South Pacific food crops. Honoma'ele is a storied land with a lot of rich history. It is this land that became the home of Kahanu Gardens, as well as Pi'ilanihale, a massive structure formed from lava rock. It is believed to be the largest ancient area of worship in Polynesia."
"Kahekili Beach","Hawaii","Kahekili Beach","Kahekili Beach was named for the last king of Maui. King Kamehameha fought to defeat King Kahekili, which was actually Kamehameha's father. They both ruled portions of Hawaii, like Kahekili ruling Maui, until the defeat occurred. The beach is now a place for guests of Maui to relax. It is a longer beach than some on the island with white sand and facilities.  The beach is located in West Maui in a city called Lahaina. It is also known as North Beach or Airport Beach. There is a windbreak that helps protect the sand and sunbathers from afternoon winds. Many use the beach as a launch point for snorkeling or scuba diving. There are plenty of different tropical fish and marine animals to view underwater. It is not the best place for swimming because there are rocks underneath, which can harm swimmers. There is a place called Black Rock further down the main beach, which offers better swimming. Restrooms, showers, covered picnic tables, grassy area, and paved parking are the facilities onsite. To reach the beach visitors need to travel on Highway 30 to the north from Lahaina towards Ka'anapali. The beach is just past Mile Marker 25."
"Kahekili Highway","Hawaii","Kahekili Highway","Kahekili Highway is a scenic, but twisty road. It is maintained by the county as county route 340. The highway takes visitors over Maui's northwest coast. It is between the area where the state changes to the county maintenance at 6.9 miles. The highway ends at 16.3 miles, which is where it becomes Honoapiilani Highway or state route 30. The southeast section of the highway is fairly unexceptional.  It took until the 90s for the highway to be paved and open for rental cars. It is considered a backdoor highway for west Maui. At times it can be an alternate route from west Maui, such as when an accident occurs on the main highway. Kahekili Highway is depended on by residents in Kahahuloa Village. Some suggestions have been made to widen the road in order to handle diverted traffic better, but as of 2001 nothing came of the suggestion. There are those who prefer to keep it as it has always been: a small one lane stretch with a few two lane areas. It is a twisted path that provides a lot of scenery to view, which is why many take it on holiday but ignore it for speedy travel."
"Kahilu Theatre","Hawaii","Kahilu Theatre","Kahilu Theatre was opened in 1981. The Kahilu Theatre is a place where presentation, support, and education can be promoted through performing arts.

The harbor can be found along the north shore where the isthmus connects west and east island sections. It is centrally located around Kahului Bay. The bay borders are towns: Kahului and Wailuku. Iao Stream comes from inland and reaches Kaului Harbor. It is a natural feature that cuts through reefs and allows the stream to fill with basalt sands, cobbles, gravels, and boulders. The shoreline around the harbor is mostly coralline with calcareous sediment and lithification.  Kahului Harbor is only one of nine commercial harbors in the entire state. Hawaii of course depends on the harbors as their transport hub for neighboring islands and cargo distribution. Kahului Harbor is manmade as a part, after dredging occurred in Kahului Bay to make it deep enough for the ships. The basic is 2,050 feet wide and 2,400 feet long with a depth around 35 feet.

"Kailua Pier","Hawaii","Kailua Pier - Kailua-Kona, Big Island, Hawaii - Launching Point for Cruises, Fishing and More","Kailua Pier has been a hub of local ocean activity since 1918. Although most fishing boats now use Honokohau Harbor, charters and cruises still launch from this facility, and recreational, shopping and dining opportunities abound. Construction of the pier and its seawall originally began in 1900. The stones used here were recycled from ancient Hawaiian royal palace walls and gun-turreted forts. When the structures were rebuilt in 1950, stones were scavenged from the enormous stonewall that once surrounded Ahu'ena Heiau Temple. Concrete pylons were poured at that time, too, and trees were planted along the pier to help beautify the downtown area. The most recent renovations were completed 2003-2004. The seawall runs all the way from the pier to the Old Kona Inn. It is not unusual to see children and old-timers cast lines from the wall, as the fishing is especially good in this area and particularly so behind the Hulihee Palace and the Inn. The seawall also affords protection to the shore during heavy seas and big storms, when waves of up to twenty feet high come crashing in from the Pacific. From several points along the seawall, the boil'' of undersea springs can be seen about 20~60 feet offshore. These springs derive from fresh water discharged by aquifers that collect it from the mountains and convey it all the way to their intersection with the seafloor. In ancient times, Hawaiian divers would take sealed gourds down into these springs to collect fresh water. Nowadays, giant sea turtles can sometimes be seen swimming in it, which helps kill the parasites and algae that grow on their skin and shells. One enduring feature of Kailua Pier is Kamakahonu Rock, a huge boulder that served as the landing point for Congregationalist missionaries from Boston in 1820. It is sometimes referred to as the Plymouth Rock'' of Hawaii. Its name means eye of the turtle'' and it can still be accessed beneath the modern-day pier, where it serves as a footing. From Kailua Pier, outrigger canoe teams launch their craft for practice sessions, paragliders set off for their skyward adventures, tour boats depart daily, and cruise lines pull in for tourists to disembark. Every day around 4pm, the local catch of the day is brought in, usually huge marlin, including many record setters. Swimming, snorkeling, and kayaking are possible right next to the pier, too. Each October some 1,500 international athletes dive into the waters from the pier as part of the 2.4-mile swim that starts the annual Ironman Triathlon. The Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament takes place here in July. This is a busy, fully functioning port throughout the year, with all manner of souvenir shops and restaurants close at hand. Among the many businesses offering services from Kailua Pier are Blue Sea Cruises with their glass-bottom Spirit of Kona, Evening on the Reef Dinner Cruises, AM and PM Dolphin Adventures, Whale Watches, and Wet n Wild Sea Adventure for snorkelers. For sunset views and seaboard meals, Captain Beans' Polynesian Dinner Cruise and the Island Grill Sunset Fun Cruise launch from the pier daily. And Kailua Bay Charter Company offers tours hourly, beginning at 10:30am each day, aboard the 36-foot glass-bottom Marian. Kailua Pier is located next to King Kamehameha's Kona Beach Hotel and the seawall runs between the pier and Hulihee Palace on Alii Drive.

"Kaiwi Channel","Hawaii","Kaiwi Channel","Kaiwi Channel is one of the water channels of Oahu, Hawaii. The channel is also called Moloka'I Channel. This channel separates the islands of Oahu and Moloka'I hence the second name. The channel is 26 miles in width with a maximum depth of 2300 feet. Near shore there are a few dive locations, but the channel can be busy with boats and currents, so it is not the greatest for underwater exploration. The middle of the channel is of course deeper thus diving is not possible.  Most use the channel for paddleboarding and outrigger canoe paddling. A contest is held each year for this exercise. At other times of the year one can just traverse the channel to enjoy the sights and sounds. By boat one can go from one island to another through the channel and see whales, dolphins, and other marine creatures. There are quite a few channels in Oahu like the Ka'ie'ie Waho that separates the islands of Oahu and Kaua'i. The width of this channel is 72 miles. It just happens that Molokai Channel is well known for its contests with old sports thus making it interesting to visit or traverse by boat."

It is located in Kaunakakai Molokai, Hawaii. Molokai is considered a private island in many areas, which means permission may need to be granted in order to see the church.  The church was a congregational establishment on the island in 1844. Harvey Rexford Hitchcock founded the church. He lived from 1800 to 1855. The building for the church began in 1844, but it was not officially completed until 1912. The church is typical of western design with a church spire for the bell house. The spire is two square stacks, the topmost smaller than the bottom. The church is rectangular in shape with a slight slope on the roof. Outside the structure were beams to help support the roof and walls. The building is still standing though it is in disrepair. It is protected as a national landmark, which could mean renovation in the years to come in order to keep it available for visitors. It is considered one of 19 attractions on the island of Molokai for visitors to see. It is also considered an absolute must to visit."
"Kamakahonu","Hawaii","Kamakahonu","Kamakahonu was the residence for Kamehameha I. It is located in the northern area of Kailua Bay in Kailua Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii. Kamehameha was also known as Kamehameha the Great. He was the king to unify the Hawaiian Islands. It is known that he spent the last years of his reign and life in the house. Kamakahonu was built between 1810 and 1819, which were also the years he reigned as king. The residence included the Ahu'ena Heiau. It is a temple with a personal shrine. It means temple of the burning altar.  Kamakahonu was also home to Liholiho, the son of Kamehameha. He was later called Kamehameha II. The site is protected today as a national landmark and it can be visited by anywhere in the park area. There is no fee to see the structure and given its state of restoration one cannot go inside the house. It can be viewed both from the beach and the ocean. It is built on a stone platform with some wood stacked up around the stone in order to keep its foundation. There is a tower and a couple of other small buildings on the platform."
"Kamalo Wharf","Hawaii","Kamalo Wharf","In Maui, Hawaii there is an abandoned wharf called Kamalo. This wharf provides views of offshore islands like Molokai, Lanai, and views of Mount Kamakou. The mountain reaches a peak of 4,970 feet and is the highest point on Maui. The wharf was a commerce site and one of the most important in older times. It was a natural harbor which made it easy to use for centuries by native Hawaiians moving from island to island. There was a population shift from Kaluaaha to Kaunakai, which is why the ships repositioned to Kaunakakai Wharf.  The wharf is named for Kamalo, an older settlement that seems sleepier than alive today. Kamalo is located on the left side of Highway 450. To get to the wharf visitors should take Highway 450 east out of Kaunakakai. It is just past the 10-mile marker on a dirt road turnoff. The wharf is for scenic viewing of the mountains and coastline. It is not a place to swim or boat from. Rather it is a place to picnic or just enjoy the views for a few moments. For those who travel to Kamalo town the wharf is just one thing to stop by and see views from."
"Kamehameha Highway","Hawaii","Kamehameha Highway","Kamehameha Highway is a main highway on Oahu, Hawaii. It runs to the suburban and rural areas. It begins with Nimitz Highway close to Pearl Harbor and the Hickam Air Force Base of Honolulu. It helps to serve the western suburbs which are the older section of Oahu. It then turns north towards Oahu Central Valley to take visits to the North Shore. From the North Shore it turns north east to bring visitors to the northern tip of the island before turning southeast around Kane'ohe Bay.  Route 99 or Kamehameha Highway will begin at the interchange of Interstate H-1. It takes visitors past sites like the USS Arizona Memorial, Ford Island, USS Bowfin, and Aloha Stadium. As one continues on the highway they can reach Aiea, Pearl City, and go past the second largest shopping mall in Hawaii- Pearlridge Center. From there an interchange to H-2 is provided so that visitors can drive around Waipio and Mililani along the Wheeler Army Airfield area and through Wahiawa. It turns into Route 80 as Route 99 bypasses Wahiawa to the west before becoming a part of Kamehameha Highway near Whitmore Village close to the sugarcane and pineapple fields."
"Kamuela","Hawaii","Kamuela - Waimea, Big Island, Hawaii - Largest Interior Municipality on the Big Island","Because there are so many areas in the Hawaiian Islands known by the name Waimea,'' the United States Postal Service had to come up with a unique term for the upland community of Waimea in the County of Hawaii. The name that was chosen was Kamuela, which means Samuel'' in the Hawaiian language. It was selected in honor of a prominent resident, Samuel M. Spencer, who was the chairman and executive officer of the Hawaii County Board of Supervisors in the early 20th century. Although all local mail is directed to addresses in Kamuela, Hawaii, residents still prefer to call their town and its surroundings by the original name. Waimea'' means reddish water, and in this part of the Big Island, it refers to the color of the streams that filter down through the hapu forests in the Kohala Mountains. For more than a century before the name Kamuela was ever heard here, Waimea was an ahupua'a - a slice of the Big Island between ten and twenty miles long and four to nine miles wide that stretched from today's Lakeland district all the way to the ocean shore. This watershed area once supported as many as 10,000 Hawaiians, and the expanse is now referred to as Kohala, both North and South. Prior to World War Two, the census-designated population of Waimea was just 1,352, but by 1990 it stood at 5,972 residents and ten years later it reached 7,028. Growth has been spurred by expanded ranching and farming jobs, as well as the addition of new resorts, schools, golf courses, religious organizations and medical facilities, such as the North Hawaii Community Hospital and the Lucy Henriques Medical Center. It has become the Big Island's largest inland municipality. Confusing though the naming may be, Kamuela nee Waimea is a spectacular part of the Big Island scene, with plenty of attractions to draw the interest of visitors and locals alike. Perhaps its best known site is Parker Ranch, noted as the largest privately-owned cattle ranch in the United States. It is the venue for an annual Fourth of July rodeo that pulls in crowds by the thousands. Waimea is also home to two important astronomical observatories based atop the Mauna Kea volcano - the W. M. Keck Observatory and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Meanwhile, on the Kohala Coast, two luxury resorts - the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel and is sister property, the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel - occupy prime oceanfront real estate. The county's ongoing improvement of local roads has helped establish commuting routes to Hilo and Kailua-Kona. Also serving the growing transportation needs of Kamuela is the Waimea-Kohala Airport. It handles primarily charters and private planes, rather than regularly scheduled flights. Currently, only interisland passenger service is available from the Waimea-Kohala Airport, although WestJet Airlines of Canada recently expanded its seasonal service to Honolulu with onward service to the Big Island via Mokulele Airlines. Kamuela is easy to reach via State Highway 19 northwest from Hilo or by taking State Route 190 northeast from Kailua-Kona. The two-stoplight town is home to three shopping centers, cultural facilities and numerous dining establishments, including fast food restaurants as well as gourmet-level establishments."

"Kaneohe Bay","Hawaii","Kaneohe Bay","Kaneohe Bay is 45 kilometers square. It is the largest bay with a shelter from the Pacific Ocean as it is sheltered by the Hawaiian Islands, most particularly Oahu. The bay has plenty of reefs underwater for divers to enjoy. It is also why the bay tends to be the most scenic and recreational bay of the windward coast of the island. The largest population of the island is found in the center of Kane'ohe, which is centered on the bay.  The Bay is 8 miles long with 2.7 miles width and a mouth opening about 4.6 miles. It has a maximum depth of 40 feet. It has been dredged to be that deep. There are two barrier reefs in the Hawaiian Islands and one is in the Kaneohe Bay. The other is the 27 mile barrier reef of Molokai. Shoaling coral reefs in the lagoon make it great for diving, but the channel had to be cut so that boats could travel through. It is the reason that dredging occurred to make a northern channel that is deep enough. The ship channel was created between 1939 and 1945. Occasionally dredging has to reform the channel as waves bring in sand and dirt from time to time."
"Kanepuu Preserve","Hawaii","Kanepuu Preserve","Kanepuu Preserve is a 590 acre dry land forest. It encompasses many native plants to Hawaii. The preserve can be found 20 minutes from downtown Lanai City, which is to the north. A 4x4 vehicle is required to travel through much of the preserve.  Roughly 48 species of native plants can be found at the preserve. The Nature Conservancy protects the forest. It is the largest dry land or olopua/lama forest in Hawaii to remain in the new millennium. Hawaii used to be covered in the same dry lowland forest until it was taken down for modern homes and businesses. It is a rare opportunity to see the endemic plant species like lama, native ebony, and aiea. Aiea was once used for canoe construction. The area is remote which is why a 4x4 is needed. A self guided tour is the only way to see the Kanepuu Preserve. It takes less than a half hour to see the entire area of forest that can be accessed by driving. There are self guided maps available at the forest entry. Larger groups can set up guided hikes through the Nature Conservancy. Hiking is permitted in some areas but one should double check before getting out to hike."
"Kapalua Golf Club, Plantation Course, Kapalua, Maui - A Hawaiian Golf Course on a Grand Scale","Hawaii","Kapalua Golf Club, Plantation Course, Kapalua, Maui - A Hawaiian Golf Course on a Grand Scale","Each year, the Plantation Course at Kapalua Golf Club is showcased as the site of the PGA Tour SBS Championship, which includes an elite field of the PGA Tour's winners from the previous season. What players and viewers alike see is a golf course on a grand scale - a par-73 course that plays to 7,411 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.6 and a slope rating of 140. The course sits atop the northwest corner of the West Maui mountains, and sprawls over pineapple plantation fields and breathtaking natural geographic formations. The Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw-designed course opened in 1991 and has won just about every award in the golf world, including a Gold Medal Award from GOLF Magazine and ranking among the best in the state by Golf Digest. And, now, the course has been renovated to be new and improved. The greens have been re-grassed with TifEagle Bermuda grass and some subtle changes were also made to five of the greens, including adding bunkers. The result is better conditions and a more playable course, with greens that roll true and fast. One of the most noteworthy and dramatic of Plantation's 18 holes is the par-5 No. 18. Despite playing downhill, the hole plays to 663 yards, making it the longest hole on the PGA Tour and a monster'' to most golfers, even from the more forward tees. Another especially noteworthy and memorable hole is No. 8, a par-3 that requires a carry over a gorge to a green fronted by a steep bunker and even more trouble to the right and left. And, of course, the tee shot almost always plays against the island's troublesome trade winds. The resort also features some impressive practice facilities, including 85,000 square feet of driving range teeing area, an 18-hole putting course, and greenside fairway practice bunkers. For instruction, the resort offers the Kapalua Golf Academy - one of the most complete state-of-the-art golf schools in the state. The facility was designed by PGA pro Hale Irwin, and includes a 23-acre practice area for every aspect of the game, including putting, chipping, wedge and bunker play, as well as full-swing and specialty shots. There's also an indoor hitting bay with video swing analysis. The Kapalua Resort is also undergoing renovations and future initiatives, and offers amenities and activities such as retail boutique shopping, tennis, a world-class spa & beach club, a mountain adventure center with horseback riding, hiking and rainforest tours, and three white-sand beaches. For dining, the resort offers eleven restaurants and lounges with an extensive, multi-cultural array of culinary choices, ranging from island-style to regional, Mediterranean, Asian and Pacific Rim fare."

The roughly 500 residents of the area live in 146 household units. 52% of the inhabitants are female. The median age is just under 42 years, a few years above the median for Hawaii on the whole. The median home value currently is estimated at $875,000 Despite the small population, residents include people of American, Latin American, European and Asian backgrounds as well as local Pacific Islanders. The cultural mix has led to mutual respect and has assisted in the local culture's successful continuity. This town is the western tip of the north shore of white sand beach resort areas. Lines of sea cliffs hover the beaches and their clear waters here. The first native Hawaiian settlers here came by boat, according to oral histories passed down to date. It is said that the beauty here soon attracted poets and other artists and local royal groups. An English Missionary here, Dwight Baldwin was given land holdings in 1836. These lands grew and eventually became a large pineapple farm and cannery. Today the main industry is tourism with a number of big resorts here as well as real estate. Roughly 1,650 acres of Kapalua are resort area while 23,000 acres is dedicated to agriculture. Local crafts and artwork are also receiving growing investment in direct relation to the market produced by tourism here. Local fishermen here continue to sell their catches to the hotels in the area and fruit orchards and agribusiness are also present in this small area. There are 3 beaches on the Kapalua Bay, all with white sand. The bay water is calm due to natural rock formations. Abundant lush green flora and flowers dot the landscape. There is a rainforest that can be explored here and a protected marine life conservation district, as well as an ancient burial ground. Beach hotels provide for fine dining right at the beach. The Kapalua Wine and Food Symposium is an annual event that brings wine and food connoisseurs from around the globe.

"Kapiolani Community College Farmers Market","Hawaii","Kapiolani Community College Farmers Market","Kapiolani Community College has a long history with a reputation for culinary arts, health services, hospitality, business education, and liberal arts. The college was started in 1946 when Hawaii was still a territory. It was called the Kapiolani Technical School then and was administered by the Territorial Department of Instruction. It was the first food service program available in the state.  In 1959, Hawaii was added to statehood. At this time three new programs were added including practical nursing, dental assisting, and business education. The school examined their programs and started over as a community college in 1965. It was also renamed at the time. Locals refer to the college as KCC. The campus was originally at Pensacola and Kapiolani Boulevard. However, growth in the 70s required a new building. The headquarters moved in 1974. It has a 52 acre campus on Diamond Head. There were also five temporary renovated buildings at the time. In 1976, Radiologic Technology instructors helped develop a new x-ray technique and earned KCC a larger name, thus earning money for a better campus building. Over the years new buildings have been added like the 1986 addition for a respiratory care center and program. Students gained the Guinness World Record in 1990 for culinary arts."
"Kapoho Tide Pools","Hawaii","Kapoho Tide Pools - Pahoa, Big Island, Hawaii - Natural Hot Tubs and Tidal Ecosystems","Located on the Kapoho Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, the Kapoho Tide Pools are an unusually large grouping of tide pools and spring fed pools that stretch out for roughly one mile along the shoreline and extend as much as 600 feet out into the Pacific Ocean. The pools formed naturally and, surprisingly, many of them are actually heated volcanically. Soaking in their warm, brackish water is said to be very soothing. For this reason, some of the smaller tide pools have been incorporated by local residents into swimming pools and hot tubs on their private property. The rarely crowded pools located in public areas are also available for bathing and afford a very calm and relaxing experience to those willing to seek them out. Tide pools only form in areas where the ocean meets the land in such a way that tidal erosion occurs. The rocky tide zone is continually shaped by the actions of the wind, sun and water. As the sun bears down, it heats the rock surfaces and exposed organisms. The wind dries them and also causes waves to build and pound against the shoreline. Gradually, the battering surf shapes the rocks, depositing loose stones and sand that grinds away at the surface, forming pockets where calm water can collect. Because portions of the shore are constantly being covered and uncovered by water, tide pools can be a harsh and brutal environment for plant and animal life to survive in. Tide pool life forms have to avoid being washed away by the waves. They must also not dry out or be eaten by predators turning low tide. Nevertheless, the Kapoho Tide Pools which dot the coastline are brimming with sea creatures, making them a wonderful area to explore. A wide variety of fish species live within their multi-colored coral beds. The water is usually quite clear, allowing for easy viewing of sea life within these mini-ecosystems, even for those who do not bring along a diving mask and snorkel. It is not uncommon to see a Moray Eel or two swimming lazily in the warm waters. Many of the larger Kapoho Tide Pools are interconnected. Although a few reach depths of up to ten feet, most are relatively shallow, just a few feet deep, and their surface conditions are calm enough for wading children and weak swimmers. Other tide pools are so close together that it is easy to climb out of one and drop right down into the next. The bottoms and sides of the pools are often smooth, but it is a good idea to wear sandals or water shoes for walking across the lava rock between them. Also bring a towel, drinking water and sunscreen. There are no facilities here, even though the Kapoho Coast does have lava shelves that make for excellent sunbathing sites. To get to the Kapoho Tide Pools, take State Highway 11 south from Hilo. At Keau, turn left onto Pahoa Road (Route 130) and follow the signs for Kalapana. Past the town of Pahoa, look for signs pointing the way to Kapoho. After passing Lava Tree State Park, take a left on Route 132 and continue until it ends at a four-way intersection. Turn right onto Route 137. Just before mile marker #9, turn left on Kapoho Kai Road. Take the next left on Kaheka, and then turn right on Waiopae. You will see the ocean and tidal pools from here, stretching out along the coast. Parking is limited."

It is considered an ancient Hawaiian Grove. It was planted during King Kamehameha V's reign. There are hundreds of coconut palm trees in the grove. It is the most notable natural landmark for the Island of Molokai.  The grove can be slightly dangerous due to falling coconuts, which is why it is safer to view it from the Kiowea Beach Park rather than going into the grove. It is considered one of the best places to watch the sunset and it is one of the last Royal coconut groves in the Island chain. It should be mentioned that Molokai has many private locations like the oldest Heiau. It is considered to be a private island, thus one has to ask permission to visit, even the old coconut grove or the Heiau.

One of the Finest Golf Gems of the Pacific","The Kiele Course at the Kauai Lagoons Golf Club is an 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature course located amid a tranquil, tropical setting. According to Nicklaus, the terrain lent itself so well to his vision that he made only a single change to his original design. The result is a course that's been hailed as one of the finest golf gems of the Pacific region. With a unique style, the course features fairways that weave alongside impressive ocean cliffs, pass over promontories perched high above the Mawiliwili Harbor, and wind through 38-acres of freshwater lagoons. Golfers will encounter stunning views of the Pacific Ocean and Kalapaki Bay, as well as mountains and forests of mango trees. Even though the Kiele Course is considered the crown jewel'' of the resort, the Kauai Lagoons Golf Club is making enhancements during 2009 to make it even better. After the enhancements, the new Kiele Course will boast more ocean holes than any other golf course in Hawaii. One of the most noteworthy holes on the course is the par-3 13th, which is regularly included in the list of Hawaii's best golf holes. In the tee box, golfers find themselves posing on a cliff, gazing in awe at the daunting shot that awaits: a tee shot over a gaping, foaming gulf to a green that looks like a postage stamp in the distance. The Kiele's signature hole is the 16th. At a mere 279 yards from the middle tees, golfers might be tempted into going for the green on this par-4 teaser. The tee shot is a blind one, however, into a narrowing, downhill fairway that tends to funnel balls to the left. Too far left or long, however, and tee shots and approach shots will find the Pacific Ocean. The original Kiele Course has received numerous awards and honors over the years, including being ranked among America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses'' by Golf Digest and a ranking among the Best Resort Golf Courses'' by Golfweek.

It was opened in 2007 and is the first railroad to be built in Hawaii in the last 100 years. Grove Farm and Kauai Plantation Heritage Railways share a common ancestry, which has lead to the building of Kauai Plantation Railway. The railroad provides tours of Kilohana, which was the estate of Gaylord Parke Wilcox from 1881 to 1970. Wilcox was manager of Grove Farm Plantation. His sister, Mabel, started the Grove Farm Museum.  Kauai Plantation Railway runs on a 3 mile loop through the agricultural land of Kilohana estate and plantation. It was designed by Boone Morrison, known for his work as a historic restoration architect. The train cars are all new, but they were modeled after the 1880s passenger trains that used to operate on the Big Island of Hawaii. The train is made up of enclosed and open sided cars. The coaches sit on six 35-foot flatcars. These flatcars were built in 1941 at Pearl Harbor. The US Navy built them for use by Oahu Railway and Land Company.

There are also a number of tropical fish. The beach does not have a lifeguard on duty, so swimming or entering the water alone is not recommended. The resort does not allow visitor parking. It is for guests only."
"Kawaiahao Church","Hawaii","Kawaiahao Church","Kawaiahao Church is located at 957 Punchbowl Street in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii. The church was established in 1842 with 5,000 parishioners.

"Kawamoto Orchid Nursery","Hawaii","Kawamoto Orchid Nursery","Kawamoto Orchid Nursery obtained its start in 1934 when Patrick Kawamoto was 14 years old. He purchased his first orchid plant. They were recent immigrants to Hawaii and money was extremely tight. He managed to earn funds by cleaning yards and the money usually went to help his family. However, his fascination with the orchid caused him to purchase one and thus he eventually began a nursery.  At first Patrick was a welder, but he continued to work on his orchids practicing propagation and cultivation. In 1947 he opened the nursery doors. Today the nursery is still in the family and considered a tradition. They export thousands of varieties each year and have 3.5 acres of orchid land. Les, Patrick's son, operates the nursery as the third generation owner. Visitors to Honolulu are welcome to tour the shop and purchase orchids. It is also possible to purchase the plants online. They are open Monday through Saturday 8am to 3:30pm. They are always closed on Sunday. The nursery is located in the valley of Palolo on Oahu. The Kawamoto Orchid Nursery often holds shows about the plants and will even teach a bit about cultivation."
"Ke'e Beach","Hawaii","Ke'e Beach","Ke'e Beach is on the northern shore of Kauai just off Highway 560. The beach is literally at the end of the road. It is also the most visited beach on Kauai. Kalalau Trail is famous and begins at the western edge of the beach. Several mini series and movies have been filmed on the beach and trail such as The Thorn Birds and Castaway Cowboys.  Ke'e has a lagoon that is perfect for snorkeling. Puka Ulua is an opening on the left side of the lagoon, which opens out to the sea. Currents tend to be strong in this area, so it is better to stay in other areas of the lagoon for swimming and snorkeling. People tend to fish here as well for Ulua Fish. Visitors can walk a short distances towards Ha'ena to see the panoramic views of Na Pali Coast. On this walk at the beach one can keep going to Limahuli Stream. Taylor Camp is located on the stream, which is a hippie colony. It was founded by Elizabeth Taylor's brother.

"Kealakekua Bay","Hawaii","Kealakekua Bay - Captain Cook, Big Island, Hawaii - Sheltered Bay for Water Sports and Sea Life","Located on the Kona Coast, Kealakekua Bay is the Big Island's largest sheltered natural bay. It covers 315 acres, stretching out for 1.5 miles in length and a mile wide. This is the site where Hawaii's first European visitor, British Captain James Cook, chose to moor his ship while exploring the island. It is also where he died, on February 14, 1779, murdered by locals over a stolen longboat. Today, Kealakekua Bay is a Marine Life Conservation District. It offers visitors the opportunity for snorkeling, scuba diving, and sea kayaking in clear waters filled with coral and inhabited by schools of tropical fish. Occupying the shoreline here is Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park, a highly frequented attraction for tourists. It is equipped with a parking lot, picnic tables, informational signage, public restrooms, and a drinking fountain. At the park's pavilion, occasional dance, music, and crafts classes are held. Local families use it for parties and receptions, too. Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park is the location of Napoopoo Beach, a rocky beach that popular among local body boarders. It is also home to the scenic cliffs of Kaawaloa and a hikiau heiau (sacred temple), which can be found slightly uphill from the beach. The main attraction here, however, is the 27-foot-high white obelisk that stands as a monument to Captain Cook. It was erected on the shore of Kealakekua Bay in November 1874 by some of his fellow countrymen'' to mark the spot where he died. Getting to the monument by land can be quite difficult, but access from the sea is relatively easy and rental kayaks are the preferred method of visiting the site. Out in the clear waters of the bay is a fragile and brilliant reef. When its waters are calm, Kealakekua Bay offers ideal snorkeling conditions, with visibility up to 100 feet and temperatures averaging 76 degrees. However, under stormy conditions, the currents can be strong and dangerous. Caution is advised and posted warnings should always be obeyed. The waters of Kealakekua Bay are teeming with sea life. Among the many species that live here are Butterfly fish, Yellow Longnose Butterfly fish, Yellow Tang and Whitemouth Moray eels. There are also Sea Cucumbers, Goatfish, Yellow Acorn worms, Red Slate pencil urchins, and corral turrets. Naia, or so-called Hawaiian Spinner Dolphins, use the bay for resting and as a nursery for mothers and calves. The rules of the Conservation District insist that swimmers stay away, at least 50 yards, from the dolphins and not interfere with their nursing or catching of prey. Similarly, the great turtles that swim here should be avoided. As endangered species, the Green Sea Turtle and the Hawksbill Turtle are strictly protected by state and federal laws. And the coral is not to be disturbed, either. Kealakekua Bay is a delicate ecosystem that depends upon the living reef to sustain its many marine residents. Admission to Kealakekua Bay is free of charge. To get there, head south on Queen Kaahumanu Highway (State Highway 11) to Napoopoo Road. Turn here, and then right again onto Puuhonua Road, which leads to Kealakekua Bay State Historical Park. It is about 40 minutes south of Kailua-Kona."

"Kealia Beach","Hawaii","Kealia Beach","Kealia Beach or Salt Bed Beach is just off Highway 56 in East Kauai, Hawaii. It is a north beach, a little north of Kapaa Beach. The beach extends 150 feet wide and .5 miles in length. It is a popular beach for surfing and boogie boarding. The summer months are best for surfing as the riptide is not as fierce. It is best to check the ocean conditions before surfing though since there is no lifeguard on duty. It is best for surfing rather than swimming because of the riptides.  The north shore of the beach was once a landing site for steamers letting off goods and passengers to Kealia. Kealia was a plantation town, so there were often goods to send off and bring in. The ruined dock still remains. Kealia Beach is also known as a Salt Bed. In ancient times Hawaiians would take salt from the area that used to form in the sand flats. Now those who mine for salt do so at the dunes next to the highway. Kealia Beach does not have facilities, but does have nice white sand for sunbathing and beach volleyball.

It is not a timeshare. Instead, all of the units are privately owned. In fact, only a few of the condos here are not owner-occupied, so the people seen on the tennis courts or lounging beside the pool are more likely to be local residents than visiting tourists. Of the eleven units listed for use here by Aloha Condos, Inc., the property manager, six are condo-apartments and five are two-story townhomes. Almost all of them face the Pacific Ocean from the rocky shore of the complex, although one condo overlooks the golf course at neighboring Kona Country Club, while one townhome has a beach view. All of the units available have two bedrooms. Some can accommodate up to six or seven guests, although the majority are approved for occupancy by no more than four persons. A few are air-conditioned, but the majority are cooled by ceiling fans. Full kitchens, A/V equipped living rooms, independent dining areas, in-unit washer/dryers and private lanais come standard. The common-use facilities of the Keauhou Kona Surf and Racquet Club include a lap-worthy pool with a shallow area for children, a lounge deck furnished with reclining chairs, a shady cabana and outdoor barbecue areas.

"Kilauea Iki Trail, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Kilauea Iki Trail, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Hike Around an Active Volcano","As hiking courses go, the Kilauea Iki Trail is officially rated as moderate, but that refers only to the physical exertion required to complete it. In terms of memorability, it might be better ranked as unforgettable.'' The scenery along the 3.33-mile course varies from tropical rainforest to desolate igneous terrain. The trail is located within Hawaii Island's renowned Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Its 3.33-mile course takes hikers right through the heart of a recently active volcano - Kilauea Iki Crater. This is the site of the 1959 Kilauea volcanic eruption, a short-lived event that produced spectacular lava fountains - among the highest and hottest ever recorded in Hawaiian history. One end of the path originates on the east side of the Thurston Lava Tube parking lot, away from the crater. Signs direct hikers up an easy climb to the right where the walkway proper begins. From here, the route descends, first gradually and then more steeply, en route to the lava tube. There is a bridge to cross at the mouth of the tube, which leads to a nearly flat lava floor. The interior is lit to allow viewing of how the molten magma smoothed the tube's otherwise rugged walls. Tree roots hang down from the ceiling above, while dripping water seeps through cracks in the rock. From the tube, hikers can access the crater floor. The trail is not well marked here, but it can be made out as a line of slightly lighter black soil extending to the far side of the crater. Steam rises from tiny cracks in the lava alongside the route. In some places, the solidified lava has been uplifted and in parts it has formed a rolling field of lava rocks. Stacks of these rocks have been used as trail markers called cairns'' or ahu.'' From the floor, the trail rises 460 feet to the rim. The path circles both the Kilauea caldera and pit by following along the crater rim. The trail does not, however, lead to Halemaumau, which is historically the most active part of the caldera where noxious fumes are common. The trail does, however, allow viewing of the complete volcanic environs. Various plants have been labeled along the way, such as uluhe fern, ginger, tree ferns, and ohia. Native Hawaiian birds can be heard singing in the trees nearby, and it is not uncommon to see a Kalij pheasant or two along the trail. Many have said that the most difficult part of the hike is to keep moving. There are so many scenic views and off-trail sites to explore, the circuit can easily take more than two and a half hours, compared to the hour and 40 minutes that most guides give as a reference. Rangers can be found on duty at the Kilauea Visitor Center, which is located at Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96785. They can provide assistance for hikers, along with trail information, maps, and permits. The center is open from 7:45am to 5pm daily. The entry fee is $10."
"Kilauea Lighthouse","Hawaii","Kilauea Lighthouse","Kilauea Lighthouse was dedicated in 1913 once construction on it was finished. The lighthouse was instrumental to Kauai, Hawaii at the time. It helped lead ships from the Orient run into the harbor close by. It was built on a point with a rocky shore, which could be detrimental to ships if they sailed too close, and therefore the lighthouse would help be a navigation point.  The lighthouse is available for tours today. It is considered one of the most visited locations on the island with more than 500,000 visitors each year. Unfortunately, weather and the marine environment have had their effect on the lighthouse and other surrounding buildings, making the site in critical condition. Without restoration it may eventually disappear. The buildings on site include the concrete lighthouse, three field stone keeper's quarters, cisterns, a fuel oil shed, and supply landing platform. Though it is one of the most intact historic light house stations it is starting to suffer greatly. Visitors are not allowed in the buildings, but can walk around Kilauea Point. The lighthouse was pivotal to the sugar plantation town, Kilauea and is a beloved structure even today. It has been registered as a national historic place as of 1976 when it was decommissioned."

"Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Hawaii's Most Active Volcano","Located within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Kilauea is one of five volcanoes in the County of Hawaii. The others include Hualalai and Mauna Loa, which are still active, along with Kohala and Mauna Kea, which are dormant. Some 500 years before the park was formed, native Hawaiians lived, worked and worshiped on the sacred ground here. It was not until 1823 that Reverend William Ellis became the first European to travel through this region. Since then, literally millions of visitors have come to view Kilauea's active lava flows. This is the site of the Big Island's 1959 volcanic eruption. Although it was a short-lived event, it produced the highest, hottest, and most spectacular lava fountains in Hawaiian history. Since 1983, the Kilauea volcano has erupted lava almost continuously from its east rift zone. Some 250,000 to 650,000 cubic yards of lava is still being output every day at Kilauea. Most of it passes through lava tubes to the Pacific, where impressive plumes of steam rise up. When the lava comes into contact with the cool water, it fragments and adds rubble to the sea floor. Lava flows have added more than 568 acres of new coastland to the southern shore of the volcano. They have also buried 8.7 miles of highway in molten rock up 115 feet deep and destroyed 187 structures in the area, notably the park's Wahaula Visitors Center. Occasionally, explosive eruptions occur here, including steam explosions as well as spurts of magma. One such occurrence in 1924 shot rocks weighing several tons nearly half a mile. Scientists say that there is no way to predict when the eruptions will stop. Some geologists believe the activity on Kilauea's east rift zone could continue for a full century or more. The most active part of the volcano is known as Halemaumau. It is 1,320 feet deep and roughly 3,000 feet wide. Owing to noxious fumes in the area, this part of Kilauea is closed to visitors, but numerous pathways traverse the crater, including the Kilauea Iki Trail. It circles the rim and leads through one of the inactive lava tubes. Visitors to the park will want to start at the Kilauea Visitor Center, located just beyond the park's entrance station at Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96785. The park is open 24 hours a day, year round, and the Visitor Center's hours are 7:45am to 5pm daily. Rangers on duty at the Center can provide the latest information on hiking, group activities, road conditions, and safety precautions. One special feature offered at the Center is a 25-minute film called Born of Fire, Born of the Sea.'' It is shown every hour on the hour between 9am and 4pm.

"Kipuka Puaulu (Bird Park) Trail, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Kipuka Puaulu (Bird Park) Trail, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Bird Watching in an Ancient Environs","Although a variety of birds can be seen throughout Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, one trail in particular leads to the center of avian action. Nicknamed the Bird Park Trail,'' Kipuka Puaulu Trail leads into the area's volcanic forests where the environs are especially attractive to native birds. In the Hawaiian language, kipuka'' refers to any area that features older vegetation than its surroundings. Lava flows from the Mauna Loa volcano have covered the region surrounding Kipuka Puaulu but, by sparing its vegetation and mature woodlands, a natural island'' of sorts has been created here as a habitat for a variety of local species. The trail entrance can be found just off the Kipuka Puaulu parking lot on Strip Road. A fence has been installed to keep grazing animals from entering the protected environs of Kipuka Puaulu and disturbing the vegetation, but a large sign bearing interpretive information marks the trail head and entry point through the fence. A major fire destroyed a considerable expanse of vegetation along the trail in 2000. The foliage that has filled in is therefore not as lush as might be expected. Dodonaea shrubs, morning glory vines, bracken fern and clumps of bushy beardgrass dominate. There is also Styphelia, with its pink and white berries evident most of the year. The first noticeable difference along the trail is the size of the surviving trees. Outside the kipuka, the Ohia are rather young and small, but the soil of Kipuka Puaulu is comprised of ash that is both old and deep. Koa and Ohia are both abundant, along with soapberry trees. Heading off to the left, the trail forms a 0.7-mile loop that leads to and from a giant Koa tree, which has survived here for more than 100 years. There is bee's nest in a hole up high in the tree. Kalij pheasants are almost always present, and they are so tame they often accost visitors to be fed. Benches have been provided for bird watchers to sit and search the area for rare and interesting avifauna. The Nene, Hawaii's state bird, makes its home here. It is immediately recognizable, with its black head and feet, brownish red wings with white tips, tan cheeks, and a tan or red chest. As an endangered species, only about 800 Nene are left and the Bird Park Trail is one of the few places in the islands where they can be observed in their natural environment. Another local attraction is the Hawksbill turtle. These marine animals are native to the shores of Kipuka Puaulu, which contains three of their five remaining nesting sites in the Hawaiian Islands. Turtle eggs are continually threatened by the mongoose and feral cats, so protecting them has become a special duty of the park rangers here. Palila birds can often been seen along the trail as they seek out the indigenous berries they seem to favor. Other exotic species often seen here include the laughing-thrush, house finch, northern cardinal, Japanese white-eye, and red-billed leiothrix. The singing of the birds in the trees and brush can often been heard long before a single one makes an appearance. The address of the Kipuka Puaulu (Bird Park) Trail is Strip Road, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Big Island of Hawaii, Hawaii 96785. It takes about an hour to make the circuit with pauses for seeing the sights."

"Ko Olina Lagoons","Hawaii","Ko Olina Lagoons - Kapolei, Hawaii - Manmade Swimming Holes on Oahu's West Coast","The Ko Olina Lagoons are something of an anomaly in Hawaii, where beautiful tropical bodies of water occur naturally. Four of the seven inlets that mark the shore of the Kapolei coast are manmade, with artificially constructed depths, beaches and rocky outcroppings. But what nature did not provide on the leeward side of Oahu, humans have done an incredible job of constructing, as any visitor to the western shores will readily agree. The four lagoons are named Hanu, Naia, Kolola, and Ulua. Each one of them is protected from the high surf of the Pacific Ocean by large rock barriers. This makes the water safe for swimming throughout the year, unlike the exposed beaches of the windward shore, which are battered by waves in the winter months. The designed tranquility that has been created makes these lagoons too calm for surfing and other water sports that depend on waves and wind. Those seeking the excitement of big surf can find it further north along the coast. But for families and those who appreciate a picturesque scene for picnics, wading, swimming, snorkeling, sunbathing and beachcombing, the manmade lagoons are just perfect. They also have the advantage of being much less crowded than popular Waikiki Beach, even on weekends. Apart from the imported sands that line their perimeters, the Ko Olina Lagoons have all of the extra amenities it takes to make good beaches. For example, showers, restrooms, picnic tables, public phones and beach shops are within a few steps of each cove. Lifeguards are on duty throughout the season, and most of them don't mind keeping an eye on children. The resorts that have popped up beside the lagoons offer everything else you might imagine for a tropical paradise experience, from luxury spas and championship golf to dining at upscale restaurants. Seven translucent lagoons and over a mile of seashore pathways ensure accessibility to an abundance of water activities, including swimming, snorkeling, deep-sea fishing, scuba diving, sailing and sunset dinner cruises. Overlooking the beautiful Naia Lagoon, for example, is the Marriott's Ko Olina Beach Club, the Marriott Vacation Club International's first resort on Oahu. Also positioned near one of the lagoons is the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort & Spa. It has access to one of the finest white-sand beaches in all of Hawaii. Meanwhile, the Ko Olina Beach Villas Resort has private two- or three-bedroom villas facing the sandy lagoons. Also nearby is Roy's Ko Olina, a famous restaurant offering diners a stunning view of the lagoons and waterfalls near the 18th hole of Ko Olina Golf Club. And the Ko Olina Wedding Chapel has a 180-degree view of the blue crescent-shaped lagoons facing the turquoise sea. The grassy areas of the Ko Olina Lagoons are ideal for picnics, although perhaps a bit overly manicured for the tastes of naturalists. Each lagoon is wheelchair accessible and there are public access boat ramps for kayaks, canoes and small sail craft. A few cautions are worthy of note. The rocks that separate the four lagoons can be quite slippery and dangerous to climb. More than a few accidents have occurred. Also, on rough weather days, currents can be strong enough to drag weak swimmers out to the open ocean. Be sure to stay within the marked safe areas and always obey lifeguards, postings and warning signs/flags. The Ko Olina Lagoons are located at 91-1001 Olani Street, Kapolei, HI 96707, adjacent to the 43-acre Ko Olina Marina, which was voted Marina of the Year'' for 2008 by Marina Dock Age magazine."
"Ko'olau Golf Club","Hawaii","Ko'olau Golf Club, Kaneohe, Hawaii - Considered One of the World's Most Challenging Golf Courses from the Back Tees","With a slope rating of 152 from the back tees, Ko'olau can rightly be considered for the title of World's Most Challenging Golf Course.'' That's not surprising, considering the course was carved out of a tropical rain forest on the windward side of the 2,000-foot Ko'olau Mountain Range. When gazing upon the course, many golfers have described it as resembling the setting for Jurassic Park.'' The course, designed by Dick Nugent and Jack Tuthill, combines three distinct climate zones and plays over extreme elevation changes and winding ravines, while displaying breathtaking views of waterfalls and lush vegetation. The advice for golfers playing Ko'olau sums up what to expect: Bring as many extra balls as your handicap.'' The course also offers a compelling view of Kaneohe Bay, yet the course fairways are not bordered by traditional rough or water, but, rather, by ball-eating jungle. The course is known for its huge sand bunkers and forced carries - 11 of the 18 holes bring ravines into play - as the layout weaves in, out, around and through the dense rain forest. Of late, the course has been made more user-friendly, but Ko'olau still packs plenty of challenge. For golfers who choose the Resort'' tees, the course plays to a manageable 6,797 yards with a USGA rating of 71.7 and a slope rating of 138 on Seashore Paspalum grass. One of the most noteworthy holes on the course is No. 18, which is considered the toughest par-4 to be found on any Hawaii course. At 476 yards from the back tees, and a still-substantial 432 yards from the Resort tees, even a par score on this hole is extremely rare. Since being built in 1992, the course has received many honors and accolades. Golf Digest named it one of the top three golf clubs in Hawaii, GOLF Magazine ranked it among the Top 100 Places You Can Play,'' and Golflink.com ranked it 7th among the Top 100 United States Golf Courses.'' Ko'olau also offers a five-acre practice facility, including a grass driving range, an elevated chipping green with a bunker, as well as a two-tier, 7,000-square-foot putting green. There's also a 3,000-square-foot pro shop with a full range of equipment, clothing and accessories. Rental clubs are available. The KMR School of Golf is also available for golf instruction. Ko'olau also features one of the most noteworthy clubhouses - 120,000 square feet of elegance for relaxing and dining. The clubhouse features a snack bar as well as the Honey's at Ko'olau Restaurant. Named after Honey Ho, a kupuna'' (honored elder, and father of legendary entertainer Don Ho) from Kaneohe, the restaurant offers Continental and Pacific-Asian cuisine, as well as live entertainment on weekends."

"Koko Crater Botanical Garden","Hawaii","Koko Crater Botanical Garden - Honolulu, Hawaii - Plants Thrive in a Dormant Volcano","The Koko Crater Botanical Garden covers sixty acres within the inner slopes and basin of a huge volcanic crater near Hanauma Bay on the east side of Oahu Island. Although the land for this project was set aside in 1958, the gardens are still considered to be in the early stage of development. Koko Crater itself is a cinder cone that was formed about 10,000 years ago by the last volcanic action on Oahu. It features Hawaii's tallest tuff ring, at a height of 1,207. The crater's slopes drop steeply to the Molokai Channel (aka Kaiwi Channel), where the coast is unprotected by offshore reefs and sea turbulence is especially great. Because the climate inside Koko Crater is hot and dry, it is an ideal location for the xeriscape program directed by the Honolulu Botanical Gardens Division of the County Department of Parks and Recreation. Some of the plants already thriving here are cacti, succulents and dryland palms. Among specific varietals that have been introduced are alluaudia, sansevieria, baobab, aloe, euphorbia and adenium. The gardens have been subdivided into four major geographic sectors: Hawaii, the Americas, Madagascar and Africa. When visitors arrive, their first impression is of the colorful cultivars of plumeria and bougainvillea that have been planted along the outer crater. When in bloom, these are particularly fragrant, and breezes carry their scents all the way to the parking area. Those who enjoy hiking will find the gentle two-mile loop trail that leads through the gardens as fascinating as it is easy. Dryland plants dominate the Hawaii sector, but of special interest is a grove of native wiliwili trees (Erythrina sandwicensis). This particular stand is protected under Hawaii State Law by the Exceptional Tree Act 105. As the trail proceeds between the cultivated areas, it is flanked by naturalized and exotic kiawe and koa haole trees. Selective planting and water conservation have certainly transformed this landscape. Even the hardiest of plants would not survive in these desert-like surroundings without the human attention that has allowed rare and endangered species to flourish here. With stops for viewing and photographs, the complete hike takes about 90 minutes. Guided tours can be arranged by making an appointment in advance with the Honolulu Botanical Gardens, which is dedicated to recreation as well as conservation, preservation, botanical research, horticulture and education. As noted, the Koko Crater Botanical Garden is still under development, so restroom facilities and drinking fountains are not yet available, although a few benches and shade areas have been provided as rest stops. Visitors are advised to bring bottled water, sunscreen and hats. Comfortable walking shoes are also recommended, especially for those who wish to hike the unpaved roads and trails. Bicycles, motorized vehicles and dogs are not permitted on the grounds. Many of the plants here contain substances that may cause skin irritation, sneezing, eye inflammation or puncture wounds. For this reason, caution should be used in touching any unfamiliar plants. Visitors are prohibited from picking any part of the growing plants, nor may any plant material be removed from the garden. Admission to the Koko Crater Botanical Garden is free of charge. Opening hours are from sunrise to sunset daily, except Christmas and New Year's Day. The entrance can be reached from Waikiki by car, taking the Kalaniana'ole Highway past Hanauma Bay and Sandy Beach to Kealahou Street, turning left and following the signs for Koko Crater Stables, where the free parking area is located. Koko Crater Botanical Garden is also on Public Bus Route #23; the stop is the intersection of Kealahou and Kokonani streets."

"Kukaniloko Birthing Stones","Hawaii","Kukaniloko Birthing Stones - Wahiawa, Hawaii - Birthplace of Hawaiian Royalty","The term Kukaniloko means to anchor the cry from within,'' which is an appropriate name for this five-acre historical site in the very heart of Oahu Island. The Royal Birthing Stones here are where women of the Hawaiian royal family would come to bring future generations of leaders into the world. According to legend, an Oahu chieftain first chose this location for the birth of his son, Kapawa, sometime between the 12th and 14th centuries. Over the next 300~500 years, the outcrop and its more than 80 rounded stones became the sacred birth grounds for the ali'i, or chiefs of the island. Ma'ilikukahi and Kakuhihewa were both born here, two chiefs whose reigns were marked by peace and prosperity. The birthing ceremonies continued until well into the 17th century. As part of the ritual, the pregnant royal would lay herself down on a finely woven mat atop the smooth lava stones. Retainers would surround the mother and hold her in place, using indentations in the stones as footholds for leverage. Gravity was expected to do most of the work, although a Kahuna (shaman) or two would also be on hand to assist. Known as pohaku, the rocks, according to Hawaiian belief, contained the power to ease the labor pains of childbirth. The mother also had to follow a strict diet, ingesting various local plants - a sap mixed with water - to prepare her for painless'' labor. To bear official witness, 36 chiefs needed to be in attendance. Since no paper documentation was available then, only their testimony would serve as the record of birth. Then, when the baby was born, the words he ali'i, he akua, he wela'' would be called out, announcing a chief, a god, a blaze of heat.'' Next, the newborn would be taken to a nearby waihau heiau (round temple) called the Ho'olonopahu. This was where purification rites were conducted. The cutting of the umbilical cord would be overseen by 48 chiefs, and then sacred drums were beaten to broadcast the arrival of new royalty. In 1925, Kukaniloko became the first ancient site on Oahu officially recognized and designated for long-term preservation. By then, the Ho'olonopahu had been destroyed and many of the actual Royal Birthing Stones had been rearranged to be used as celestial maps. They are said to mark the positions of stars, as well as shifts in the seasons. Today, thirty-six stones guard the entrance at Kukaniloko, 18 on the left and 18 on the right. These stones are not originals, however; they were placed here by the Department of Land and Natural Resources to represent the 36 chiefs. The original stones are scattered about, but easily recognized by their bowl-like shapes; petroglyphs showing human forms and circles appear on some of the stones. Two display boards erected by the Wahiawa Hawaiian Civic Club provide visitor information. Those who visit should keep in mind that this is one of the most important sites in Hawaii, sacred to the Hawaiian people, who often place flower leis upon the stones as sign of reverence for past traditions. Visitors should refrain from climbing or walking on the rock walls and platforms, and nothing at the site should be moved or removed. To get to the Kukaniloko Birthing Stones, take to H1 West to the H2 North and get off at Exit 5 (Wahiwa). Kamehameha Avenue leads north through Wahiawa to Whitmore Avenue, where you will turn left onto a dirt road that seems to lead into a pineapple field. The stones can be found just a few yards down this road."

These turtles live up to 80 years of age and they are cold-blooded. At times the turtles will stroll up to the beach and relax in the warm sun. Visitors are able to swim and snorkel with the turtles as most of them are friendly, but there are simple rules that should be followed when swimming with the turtles so that neither the turtle nor people get hurt. Firstly give them at least 10 feet of space and do not block a turtle when they are surfacing, do not touch the turtles and do not ride on a green sea turtle. For the avid surfer the beach is fitted with a HD web cam, which provides live feeds to a website of the beach and surfing conditions, along with weather updates. Laniakea Beach is located only 1.5 miles from the historic town of Haleiwa, when driving to the beach when visitors see cars parked on the dirt on the right 'pull in' to park. Visitors will have to cross heavy traffic so caution is to be taken."
"Lanikai Beach, Hawaii","Hawaii","Lanikai Beach, Hawaii - Kailua, O'ahu, Hawaii - Remote O'ahu Beach Means Few Tourists While Enjoying Calm Waters","Lanikai Beach, Hawaii is located in Kailua off of Kailua Road in Kailua on the south eastern side of the Island of O'ahu. O'ahu is the most populated of the Hawaiian Islands and is the third largest. Lanikai is about a 20 minute drive from downtown Honolulu and 30 minutes from the Honolulu International Airport, which is the nearest airport to this beach. The Hawaiian name of Lanikai is translated in English as Royal Sea or Heavenly Sea. There are public access walks that lead to this beach. There are no steep drops in the water and the waters are usually fairly calm due to the reef within less than 0.5 a mile off the beach that helps to break the surf. That means that swimming is usually good here and fish are clearly visible beneath the waves near the shoreline. However surfboard vacationers should look to elsewhere on the island for more suitable beaches such as on the northern coast. Looking across the waters, that are known for appearing particularly turquoise in hue, appear the two Mokulas Islands offshore from the beach. A landward view is dominated by lines of palm trees. The water is particularly clear as there are no streams or rivers that empty into the ocean in the immediate vicinity of this beach. One can kayak or even swim from this beach to the Mokulas Islands as they are less than a half mile from the south end of the beach. However it is a swim against the current and as the islands are located on the seaward side of the Lanikai Reef, there is big surf and strong winds, particularly in the winter months. The views from Lanikai Beach, Hawaii, have made it the backdrop for many photo shoots over the years. There are no lifeguards here or facilities for creature comforts. However there is ample shade and probably not very many people. Lanikai Beach, Hawaii, has made the list of the top 10 beaches in the USA that is annually announced since 1991 by Dr. Stephen Leatherman of the Florida International University, known as Dr. Beach. Dr. Beach makes his yearly choice based on 50 criteria and after a 2 year study he carried out of 650 public beaches prior to assembling his first list. There is a fairly comfortable residential area just off the beach here that is favored by the lack of public amenities, which helps keep tourists to a minimum. There is no parking lot. Parking is along the road above the beach area. Local Hawaiians have repeatedly classified this among their ten best beaches in Hawaii. There are several vacation homes available for rent here for several months at a time as well as nearby hotels for visitors to this beach."
"Lapakahi State Historical Park - North Kohala","Hawaii","Lapakahi State Historical Park - North Kohala, Big Island, Hawaii Ancient Village on a Rugged Coastline","Situated on 262 acres of wind-swept, rocky coastline, the Lapakahi State Historical Park is an archaeological site focused on the remains of a 14th-century Hawaiian fishing community. The coastal waters are part of the Lapakahi Marine Life Conservation District of Keawanui Bay, and the ruins excavated here are among the most culturally important on the Big Island of Hawaii. A self-guided tour through the old village starts at the park entrance. Brochures are available from staff members, who man an information kiosk there. Interpretive displays set up by the Department of Land and Natural Resources give an overview of the area, with photographs and maps. The recommended course takes visitors along a marked trail past old house sites, including a canoe halau (long house). Lava stone walls were used to form the lower walls, while wooden poles supported the thatched roofs and walls made of pili grass. Although parts of the village have been restored, most of the walls and remains are the original stonework. Further on, there is a recreational area where such ancient games as spear-throwing, disc-rolling and konane (Hawaiian checkers) can be tried. From a bluff above the village, the entire coastline can be seen and whale watching is possible between October and April. This area was first settled in the 1300s. The ground is quite rocky, but fertile and rich in natural resources. Crops were grown in small plots next to the houses, including sweet potatoes, fruit and vegetables. Gourds were used as containers, and cooking fires were built in hollowed out logs. Fishing was the primary occupation of the villagers. Along the trail, salt pans and natural canoe shelters can be seen towards the beach. After a successful fishing expedition, the villagers would dedicate a portion of their catch to the fishing god, Ku'ula, who was said to live in stones set up as small fishing shrines. Several of these still remain along the shore. Heaps of dead while coral dot the shoreline, where strong winds race through small stands of palm trees and the endless waves crash upon the volcanic rocks. The village stretches along the coast for miles, and only a small portion of it has been excavated and restored for viewing. Speculation as to why the village eventually was deserted centers on the lack of fresh drinking water in these harsh environs. Lapakahi State Historical Park is located in North Kohala along the Akoni Pule Highway (State Highway 270) at mile marker #14. It is about 12.5 miles north of Kawaihae en route to Mahukona. The mailing address is P.O. Box 936, 75 Aupuni Street 204, Hilo, HI 96721-0936. Park operating hours are from 8am to 4pm daily, but closed on Hawaiian State Holidays. The self-guided tour covers about one lime and takes about 45 minutes. Groups may arrange for guided tours and demonstrations by making advance reservations. Many of the facilities, including the restrooms and portions of the trail, are handicap accessible. Free parking is provided for up to a dozen cars and three tour buses. Admission is also free of charge. Lapakahi State Historical Park is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"Laupahoehoe Train Museum","Hawaii","Laupahoehoe Train Museum - Laupahoehoe, Big Island, Hawaii - Preserving Hawaii's Railroad Heritage","A visit to the Laupahoehoe Train Museum is like taking a trip back in time. Its main building is the original home of a train station agent, restored to its early-1900s look. The rooms contain a wealth of photographs and memorabilia that help keep the past alive, and the grounds feature actual rail equipment of the late-19th and early-20th centuries. Opened in 1998, the Museum was created to celebrate the history of Hawaiian railroads, plantation life, and the heritage of the Hamakua Coast. Much of the focus here is on the Hilo Railroad, which began operating in 1899. It ran until 1946, when its tracks and facilities were damaged beyond repair by a devastating tsunami. Community residents helped unearth the Wye'' in the backyard of the museum, which had been buried under 50 truckloads of rubble and overgrowth. The Wye was the area where an engine's direction could be switched. Today, a diesel switch engine stands on the museum's Wye. It is the only such engine left on the island of Hawaii. Repaired and nicknamed Rusty,'' the unit is run on tour days and special occasions, although no rides are given. Keeping Rusty company is a restored narrow gauge boxcar that reportedly ran on the same tracks. It was used to carry explosives for a mill in Haina, which processed sugar cane for the plantations that owned the train line. Rusty's other companions at the Wye are a full gauge replica of a caboose and an antique horse-drawn road grader that were donated to the museum. In the Model Train Room of the Museum are several displays. Every item was acquired by donation, including the center N'' gauge display designed and built by Neil Erickson. It represents the Hilo Railroad-Hawaii Consolidated Railway line that once ran along the Hamakua Coast. The Museum's static HO gauge model was created by Stan Heggland. It won an award - the National Golden Spike - for its craftsmanship and design. The HO rail yard with its turntable was donated by Betty and George Mertyl, showing how the ways and switches worked in a functioning rail yard. The Laupahoehoe Train Museum and Visitors Center has a gift shop, where selections of unique logo items are available. These include t-shirts, sweatshirts, hats, pins, and patches, many of which have been hand-crafted by local residents. Among other merchandise on sale here are books, clothing, videos, pottery, leis, and Hawaii-made artwork. Although the Laupahoehoe Train Museum is among the state's smallest museums, it attracts an estimated 5,000 visitors a year. The admission fee is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors, and $2 for students. Special rates for tours are also offered. The museum is open weekdays from 9am to 4:30pm and on weekends from 10am to 2pm. The address is 36-2377 Mamalahoa Highway, Laupahoehoe, Hawaii 96764. To get there from Hilo, take State Highway 19 to mile marker #25. The railroad crossing signs and the big red caboose on the front lawn can be seen just across the road from the coast's only service station."
"Lava Tree State Park","Hawaii","Lava Tree State Park","Lava Tree State Park is located on Pahoa-Pohoiki Road (Hwy 132) on the Island of Hawaii and is approximately 2.7 miles from Pahoa Town. This 17-acre park features many unusual lava molds of tree trunks and is a popular place for hikers and picnickers. As with all state parks in Hawaii, visitors will find there is no charge for parking and entry.  The lava molds were formed in the late 18th century when a flow of lava swept through the forested area here and coated the trunk of Ohia trees. Visitors can explore the area by taking the 1.1 kilometer loop trail during the daytime. Roots of the trees have separated parts of the path meaning some toddlers and elderly visitors may require assistance. In addition to this, it is only open during daylight hours as there are no lights here. The park has picnic tables, restrooms and three covered structures to protect visitors from the sun and the rain. It is highly recommended that people coming to the park bring bottled water as there are no fountains here. Another feature well worth visiting in the area is the Kapoha Tide Pools, which are about 11 miles away on the coast."
"Lava Viewing Area, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Lava Viewing Area, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Site to Watch Lava Pour into the Ocean","There are actually two places on the Big Island of Hawaii from which to view lava. One of them is at mile 18.3 along much-visited Chain of Craters Road. Here, the pavement comes to an abrupt halt. It has been swallowed, perhaps forever, by the igneous rock that has formed from the flows of Kilauea Volcano. Since 1983, the volcano has been erupting continuously, pouring out some 250,000 to 650,000 cubic yards of molten lava every day. From a vantage point at the end of this road, it is easy to see impressive plumes of steam that rise up from the Pacific Ocean. This is where the lava is coming into contact with the cool water. As it hardens, the lava rock fragments and sinks to the sea floor. Gradually it accumulates to become nature's version of land reclamation. In this way, the lava flows have added more than 568 acres of new shoreline south of the volcano over the past 25 years. In the process, some 8.7 miles of paved roads have been buried in molten rock as much as 115 feet deep. It has also been recorded that the flows destroyed manmade 187 structures in the area, including the Wahaula Visitors Center of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. To the northeast of the flows is the small community of Pahoa, where another and perhaps better viewing area exists. The lava has already encroached on the town's Royal Gardens subdivision, threatened the Kaimu-Makena homesteads, and covered over parts of Kalapana Gardens. Access to the town from the park's side of the flow has been completely cut off. The community has therefore created its own Kalapana Lava Viewing Trail, just up the coast from Waikupanaha. In this area, a safe viewing program has been developed for the public by County, State and Federal agencies, under coordination by Hawaii County Civil Defense. The viewing area is open daily from 5pm until 10pm, provided that conditions remain safe for the public. No vehicles are allowed in after 8pm. This is to allow adequate time for seeing the lava before closing time. This viewing area is at the end of Highway 130. From the parking lot, it is about a half mile walk across hardened lava to the site. Visitors are advised to wear long pants, closed-toe shoes, hats and sunscreen. Because the area can be very hot and sunny, it is a good idea to bring drinking water, too. Those visiting in the evening should also bring flashlights. A limited number of portable toilets have been set up near the parking area. According to the County of Hawaii, the eruptions currently pose no threat to anyone. The lava's movement is confined to a narrow area of activity on the unpopulated coast. The USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory has been monitoring the activity closely and maintaining communication with Hawaii County Civil Defense. Should any potential threat arise to populated areas, appropriate measures will be taken to warn affected residents. In the meantime, the lava flows have become quite a tourist attraction for Hawaii Volcanoes National Park 24/7. An expanded parking area and simple toilets have been installed at the end of Chain of Craters Road. This has been necessary to accommodate the increased traffic and number of visitors who cannot make the long drive around to the Kalapana viewing area on the other side of the flow. The County of Hawaii has also established a Lava Hotline at (808) 961-8093. It is updated daily and can confirm whether the lava viewing area will be open that day. Visitors need to keep in mind that conditions can change rapidly. Viewing may be closed if any changes occur that will threaten the personal safety."
"Lekeleke Burial Ground","Hawaii","Lekeleke Burial Ground","Lekeleke Burial Ground is located at Kuamo'o Bay in the North Kona District on the Island of Hawaii and is approximately 10 miles from Keahole Airport. Also known as the Kuamo'o Burials, this historic site is the burial ground for warriors killed during a major battle in 1819. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that not only is listed on the Hawaii register of historic places, but also the National Register of Historic Places.  A paved trail winds around the site helping to give visitors a good view of the site and understand the history of the place. The burial sites are marked by rock terraces where the hundreds of Hawaiian warriors died during the battle here. Visitors are asked to stay on the trails so as not disturb the stones wrapped in ti leaves, which are left by Hawaiians in homage to the fallen. Visitors will find a plaque that explains the circumstances of the battle and how over 300 were killed. Nearby there are other interesting sites well worth visiting such as the Keauhou Holua Slide, which is about 10 minutes from the burial ground. The site was connected to the Makahiki Games, which were considered to be the equivalent to the Olympics in ancient Hawaii."
"Lihu'e","Hawaii","Lihu'e","Lihu'e or Lihue is a town in Kauai, Hawaii. It is the second largest town on the island with a population of 5,600 plus people. It is a census designated place, as well as the county seat of Kauai County. Lihue was a small village in ancient times and means cold chill in Hawaii. In 1837 it became the official government seat. Cane sugar helped the town grow in the 1800s with one of the largest sugar mills in Hawaii. The plantation struggled for a little while until 1856, at which time William Harrison Rice added a better irrigation system.  Lihue has the Kauai Community College, which is part of University of Hawaii. Tourists often visit Lihue beaches and the natural wonders in the area. Kalapaki Beach is one of the most popular beaches. It is part of Marriott Kauai's Beach Club. Kauai Lagoons Golf Club is also in Lihue. Bodysurfing, swimming, and windsurfing are popular activities at the beach. Ninini Beach has an automated lighthouse, which started operating in 1897. North of Lihue provides Wailua Falls. Lihue also offers historical locations like Alekoko, Kilohana, and Kauai Museum. Visitors to the area can view the 1000 year old reservoir which is an aquaculture site."

It offers interisland flights as well as those to mainland USA and Canada and sees over 104,000 operations annually, and in such a beautiful location it's the perfect place from which to explore. The principle airport for the island of Kauai, Lihue Airport covers 872 acres on land that was acquired in 1948. By September 1st, 1941, the airport was opened with limited operations and by January 1950 the terminal building was complete and dedicated. Since then it's undergone various expansions and improvements, which has left us with the airport we see today. The two runways, both being 6,500 foot in length, support some 104,000 operations (landings and take-offs) each year including scheduled flights, air taxi flights, general aviation and even military operations. Major airlines that operate from the airport include Island Air, US Airways, American Airlines and WestJet. Cargo facilities also allow several cargo operators to ship from the site including UPS, FedEx and Aloha Airlines. The terminal is home to a number of retail and food outlets, all with opening hours tailored to airline schedules so travelers will never be short of something to do. Passengers can grab a coffee at Starbucks or look for gifts at Travel Traders, and there's even a flower shop and news stand as well as HMS Host offering both a cafy and bar with food served throughout the day. Hawaiian entertainment is also provided at regular intervals, and the airport itself is full of display cases and artwork for visitors to explore. There are various parking options at the airport, with parking fees ranging from $1 per half hour (or free if you return within the first 30 minutes) up to $7 per day. If you pay in advance then monthly parking can be accommodated and costs just $70, and for drivers waiting to collect those arriving there's a free of charge Cellular Telephone Waiting Lot, as long as drivers stay in their cars. A local bus route stops at the airport daily, costing $1.50 a trip for adults, $0.75 for seniors and children aged 7-18 and free to children aged 6 and under. The airport is accessible by taxi and shuttle buses and car rental stations are also available at the street across from the terminal. Lihue Airport is ideally located to serve the islands of Hawaii and to allow visitors to explore the best that they have to offer. With interisland and international flights running daily, and with all the conveniences of a modern airport it offers something for all travelers with the added benefit of a Hawaiian twist."
"Lili'uokalani Botanical Garden","Hawaii","Lili'uokalani Botanical Garden - Honolulu, Hawaii - Natural Urban Waterfall and Picnic Area","Portions of this 7.5-acre garden once belonged to the last reigning monarch of Hawaii, Queen Lili'uokalani (September 2, 1838 - November 11, 1917), from whom the Botanical Garden gets its name. The quiet and secluded grounds were said to be her favorite picnic spot, and in her will she bequeathed the land to the City and County of Honolulu to be used for the public's enjoyment. The garden area itself, which is now devoted to local Hawaiian plants, is still under development. New species are being introduced on a regular basis by the Honolulu Botanical Gardens of the State Parks & Recreation Department, which manages the property as one of five such conservation areas on Oahu, the others being Ho'omaluhia Botanical Garden, Koko Crater Botanical Garden, Wahiawa Botanical Garden, and nearby Foster Botanical Garden, just to the south. Among mature trees already in place are a number of interesting native species. They include two representatives of Sapindaceae, the soapberry family: the Manele (Sapindus saponaria) and the A'Ali'i (Dodonea viscose). The latter is a hardy tree that typically grows by the coast or in lowlands. Its lightweight, papery seed-pods probably drifted to the Hawaiian Islands centuries ago, and because they are so colorful - tan, pink, yellow, or red-purple - they are often woven into leis. Also firmly rooted at Lili'uokalani Botanical Garden is the Naio (Myoporum sandwicense) of the Myoporaceae or false sandalwood family. And the Hala (Pandanus tectorius) of the Pandanaceae or screwpine family is growing well here, too. Running through the Botanical Gardens and its grassy stretches is Nuuanu Stream, a lovely little waterway from which nearby Nuuanu Avenue takes its name. There are picnic areas and walking paths along the stream, providing an unexpected oasis right in the middle of the city. It makes a nice, shady place for local residents to take an afternoon break amid a variety of local flora. The man attraction here is Waikahalulu Waterfall, which is the most photographed natural urban cascade in Hawaii, and perhaps in the entire United States. Although it drops only 20 feet, the wide flowing water and its picturesque composition make it a perfect backdrop for professional travel and fashion photographers. That, plus its convenient location amid the busy streets of Honolulu, draws plenty of camera-toting tourists as well. But visitors should be forewarned that the water basin below the Waikahalulu Falls is polluted with bacteria and deemed unsafe for bathing. Swimming is therefore not allowed. Like many photogenic locations in Hawaii, the Honolulu Botanical Gardens has become a popular venue for weddings. Couples who have been married here describe it as a beautiful, secret little world,'' and wedding planners are more than happy to help arrange access for ceremonies. Since it is a public facility, special permits are required. For simply visiting, the Lili'uokalani Botanical Garden is open daily without charge from 9am to 4pm, except Christmas and New Year's Day. It is located along the #4 bus route on North Kuakini at the end of Waikahalulu Lane off School Street. Easily accessible by car, too, plenty of free parking is available. Please note, however, that no restrooms or other facilities are provided, and the gates are locked promptly at closing."
"Liliuokalani Gardens","Hawaii","Liliuokalani Gardens - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Largest Japanese Garden Outside Japan","Located on the bay of the Waiakea Peninsula, the Liliuokalani Gardens are just off of Banyan Drive in the town of Hilo. The park's name derives from the last of Hawaii's reigning monarchs, Queen Liliuokalani, who gave up her throne in 1898 when the islands were annexed by the United States. She donated the land upon which the gardens were created. The primary feature of these 30 landscaped acres is an authentic Japanese garden, the largest true ornamental Japanese park outside of Japan. It was created in the early 1900s to memorialize Japanese immigrants who came to work on the local sugar plantations. Among the many features of the Liliuokalani Gardens are oriental plantings, curving walkways, pagodas, ponds and bridges. There are sprawling manicured lawns where children can play, and the clear waters beside the sea wall along Hilo Bay are popular for fishing by both pole and net, a relaxing pastime enjoyed by young and old alike. The park is an excellent venue for picnic lunches while relaxing beneath tropical trees. Many locals enjoy walking or jogging the trail that circles its perimeter, especially early in the day. Because the park faces east across Hilo Bay, it offers excellent views of the sun rising over the Pacific Ocean as well as the cooling breezes of the morning trade winds. Those who come with their swimsuits can enjoy a refreshing dip in the calm waters off Coconut Island, which is connected to the gardens by a slender foot bridge. In Hawaiian, the island is called Moku'ola, which means healing island.'' According to folklore, diseases and afflictions were once cured here. The Japanese gardens were designed in the traditional Yedo style. At their center is tranquil Waihonu Pond, where footbridges and gazebos have been constructed, complemented by weeping willows, azaleas, and aesthetically placed groves of bamboo. Quite recently, a Japanese rock garden was added to the park and the various paths, walkways, and drive around the park have been resurfaced. Also on the grounds is a traditional Japanese Tea House named Shoroan, which was rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1994. Its chashitsu (tea room) was donated by the Fifteenth Grand Tea Master of Urasenke. The facility is used for tea ceremonies and may be booked for events. Flanking the gardens is Banyan Tree Drive with its canopy of Banyan trees. Most of these were planted by the city of Hilo in 1935, but several were added thereafter by famous individuals whose names are displayed along with the year of planting. Among them are trees bearing the names of baseball great Babe Ruth and then-Senator Richard Nixon. To get to the Liliuokalani Gardens, take State Highway 11 (Kanoelehua) until it turns into Banyan Drive. Follow this road past the Hilo Hawaiian Hotel, and then turn to the right. The entrance to the gardens is on the left, and the Coconut Island parking lot is on the right. The address is 93 Banyan Drive, Hilo, Hawaii 96720-4632. Entrance to the garden is free. It has no fence and is therefore open year round, 24 hours a day. Restrooms and drinking water are available on site."

Swimming is not advised. There are strong currents and difficult waves, along with backwash. The lava rocks combined with the strong waves makes the water unsafe for swimming and most water activities. Surfers with excellent abilities tend to surf along the left side of the beach. Lumahai' Stream is located on the left, which is separated from the ocean in summer due to high amounts of sand deposits. It is a fresh water stream for swimming. A rock outcropping is between Kahalahala Beach and Lumahai Beach. Unfortunately, surf conditions are just as dangerous here.

The parking lot is near Mile Market #5 off of Leho Drive. There is a second right to take to get to the beach and parking lot. The beach is safe and fish feeding is allowed here. This often attracts a large crowd of people to the beach. The grassy areas are perfect for picnicking. There is a little bit of trail to make walking around the beach enjoyable too."
"Lyman House Memorial Museum","Hawaii","Lyman House Memorial Museum","The Lyman House Memorial Museum began as the Lyman Mission House in 1839. The house was built originally for David and Sarah Lyman who were missionaries; the museum was established by the descendents and now offers daily guided tours.   The museum houses many artifacts, fine art pieces, natural history exhibits along with special exhibits and a gift shop. Visitors to the house will see the house and life as it was over 150 years ago. There are also many aspects of the natural history and culture of Hawaii.

"Maalaea","Hawaii","Maalaea","Maalaea is a district of Maui located in the central area of the island. It is six miles to the south of Wailuku along Honoapi'ilani Highway or Highway 30. Ma'alaea offers plenty of entertainment for the entire day whether it is visiting Maalaea Beach, a resort, the harbor or other attractions.  Ma'alaea Harbor was a commercial port, but now it is mostly a place for cruises and pleasure boats. Whale watching tours also leave out of the harbor, as well as boats to Molokini Atol for snorkeling. Throughout the year local residents tend to head to Ma'alaea for surfing and enjoying the options in Ma'alaea. The beach is notable for the pipeline waves, but there are also Buzz's Wharf surf breaks for beginners. Outrigger canoe clubs tend to use the harbor to rest and shelter. Dining in Maalaea has some of the best seafood and service according to reviewers. Milowai Condos offers a waterfront restaurant. There is also Buzz's Wharf Restaurant that is a local landmark at the harbor. Food tends to be fresh seafood, grilled goodies, and much more at places like Blue Marlin, Bamboo Bistro, and Capiche. Lodging options in Maalaea include a variety of resorts like Ma'alaea Beach Resort."
"Maalaea Beach","Hawaii","Maalaea Beach","Ma'alaea Beach is in Kihei, Maui, Hawaii. It is a long sandy beach reachable by the Maalaea Beach Resort. Many visitors use the beach for long walks or runs. The hard packed sand makes it easier. Surfing at the beach is also a popular sport. Maalaea is known for the pipeline, but also as a beginner's surf spot near Buzz's Wharf. Many also walk on Ma'alaea Beach during sunset to watch the marine animals and enjoy the ocean views.  The harbor provides whale watching tours and snorkeling for those who want to leave the beach for a time and explore the ocean. The harbor is just a small distance from the beach for those who want to snorkel at Molokini Atol from the boats leaving the harbor. Snorkeling, swimming, and diving right off the beach is an option, but it is usually better to hire a boat out for the better diving sites. Ma'alaea Bay which is off of the beach is a National Humpback Whale Marine Sanctuary. During the right time of year one can watch the whales from the beach, as well as see green turtles along the reefs and come up to the sand at night."
"Magic Island","Hawaii","Magic Island - Honolulu, Hawaii - Sandy Peninsula for Shore Diving, Sightseeing and Weddings","Magic Island is not actually an island at all. It is a manmade peninsula and rocky point bordering the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, located within the perimeter of 76-acre Ala Moana Beach Park. Although formally christened in 1972 as Aina Moana,'' or land from the sea,'' it is unlikely that anyone other than local residents would be familiar with Magic Island by that name. Completed in 1964, the peninsula was built on thirty acres of reclaimed shallow reef. The original concept was to create a new resort hotel complex here that would cover two additional islands. But the project died soon after the first stage of reclamation was accomplished, so the area was converted into a public park. Noted for its picnic and swimming areas, Magic Island offers visitors white sand beaches and a lagoon protected by a rocky breakwater. There are wide grassy spaces for sports and recreation, picnic tables for day-trippers, and trails that can be used for cycling and inline skating. Off to the east are beautiful views of Waikiki and Honolulu, backed famous Diamond Head and fronted by the yachts moored nearby. In fact, the panorama is so stunning at dusk that Magic Island has become the last stop for sunset photos on deluxe Oahu wedding packages. Many a couple has taken their vows here, too. Romantic barefoot in the sand'' ceremonies are popular, and there is no charge for use of the crescent-shaped beach or parking facilities. During the daytime, Magic Island can be quite crowded, especially when there are surf advisories on the North Shore that drive water sports enthusiasts to the south. The surrounding waters have been rated among Hawaii's top spots for shore diving, home to spotted eagle rays, surgeonfish, stonefish, checkered cowries, turtles, coral and other sea life. Both snorkelers and scuba-divers use the beach as an easy access point for underwater excursions. By late afternoon, the sandy shore empties out a bit. Walkers, joggers and Frisbee throwers take over, joined by tourists having their photos taken beside the coconut palms. The picnic tables are popular hangouts for local residents, their friends and families, too. Each 4th of July, the city holds a huge fireworks display above Magic Island, which can be seen from hotel windows all along Waikiki. Thousands gather in the park to get a close-up view. This is also the venue for the annual Honolulu Family Festival, with thrill rides, dozens of food stalls, live entertainment, and games. Each August, it draws tens of thousands with free admission and a complimentary shuttle service. All proceeds from the festival go toward the upkeep and beautification of Ala Moana Beach Park. Along those lines, each October the Hawaii Chapter of Associated Builders & Contractors joins local government entities and volunteers at Magic Island for an annual beach clean up. Typically, 500 people show up to gather trash from the shore and shallows. Free bento lunch boxes and printed t-shirts are provided, which turns the half-day clean-up campaign into a much anticipated social event. Unfortunately, Magic Island became a preferred location for homeless squatters not long ago. As a result, the park area is now open only from dawn till dusk and overnight camping has been banned. Magic Island is located on the east end of Ala Moana Beach Park at 1201 Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, Hawaii 96814. Visitors should plan to arrive early on weekends and holidays; the parking lot fills up quickly."
"Magic Sands","Hawaii","Magic Sands","Magic Sands is Magic Sands Beach. It can also be called the White Sands Beach or La'aloa Beach Park. Magic Sands was named because of the rough surf that hits it. All of the sand is emptied from the beach temporarily going into the sea before it is moved back in. It can take a bit of time for it to come back, but it always comes back. Surfing is one of the top entertainments at the beach, as well as body boarding.  Magic Sands can be reached by traveling on Alii Drive from Kona. It is close to several of the Kona hotels, which means it is usually populated. There is always a lifeguard on duty at this beach where as some of the other Big Island of Hawaii beaches do not have a lifeguard. Facilities at the beach include showers, bathrooms and volleyball net. The beach is also close to Kahalu'u Bay Beach Park. There is a shore break at Magic Sands where the waves can get a bit high and then they will curl their way to the sandy shore. It is these waves that entice sunbathers to go to this beach over others."
"Mahaiula Bay","Hawaii","Mahaiula Bay","Mahaiula Bay is located at Kekaha State Park off Queen Kaahumanu Highway (19) at Kalaoa on the Island of Hawaii and is about two and a half miles from Keahole Airport. Visitors can come to the state park year round from 9am to 7pm seven days a week with plenty of parking available. The white sandy beach of Mahaiula Bay is about 10 minutes from the park's parking area.  The beach here is about a quarter of a mile long and is a popular spot for swimming and snorkelling. Apart from relaxing and sunbathing, tourists can observe the turtles on Mahaiula Beach and enjoy the scenic views. A hiking trail takes visitors four and a half miles from Mahaiula to Kua Bay. Along the way hikers can see a vacant house and plenty of wildlife including goats. The beach doesn't offer much in the way of facilities although there are two porta potties here. There are restrooms at the park though as well as picnic tables. The island is considered to be the golfing capital of Hawaii and the 18-hole Hualalai Golf Course is less than 10 minutes from the park."
"Mahana Beach (Green Sands)","Hawaii","Mahana Beach (Green Sands) - Kau, Big Island, Hawaii - Secluded Beach with Green Sand","Of all the unique natural wonders of the Big Island of Hawaii, the green-colored sands of Mahana Beach are certainly a unique find. The beach is located on the southern tip of the island, where the verdant color of its surface comes from small particles of peridot mixed in with the more common yellowish gray sand grains. Also known as olivine, this semiprecious translucent stone is a complex silicate of magnesium and iron, which is commonly used in refractories. Mahana Beach goes by a number of other names, Green Sands Beach being one of the most common among visitors. The locals also call it Pu'u o Mahana or Papakolea Beach. Its olive-colored sand is the result of erosion, as ocean waves have washed over the cinder cone base of the shoreline, extracting granules of olivine and depositing them amid the crystals of common sand. The beach is quite secluded and a bit difficult to reach. For those traveling on foot, it is a 2.5-mile hike on a dusty maze of rutted pathways that eventually lead to the beach. It can also be reached by mountain bike, ATV or four-wheel drive vehicle, although the going can be quite rough and slow. Some of the ruts and gullies are said to be as large as cars. Hikers should allow at least an hour to make the trek one way. The terrain is rolling tropical prairie, and although the trail is rugged, the approach is relatively straight and it is impossible to get lost. Hikers are never out of sight of the shore. Upon arriving at the cove that contains the green sands, visitors must make a steep descent down to the beach. The surrounding rocks form a giant bowl. There is no easy path down, but near the middle of the bowl there is a ladder to help with part of the climb and worn foot holds in the sandstone show the way. A little rock-climbing skill may come in handy at this point. Although some locals youths prefer to leap from the cliffs into the waters far below, this is not recommended if you are unfamiliar with the depths and shallows. The waves crashing against the gateway outcroppings can be quite spectacular, but the waters can be so turbulent that swimming is not recommended beyond the protected entrance to the cove. Sunning, snorkeling and boogie-boarding are favored activities closer to the shore. Visitors are advised to bring towels, sunscreen, and plenty of drinking water. There are no facilities at all at Mahana Beach, no restrooms or lifeguards, and the climate can vary from tropically hot and windy to overcast and rainy. Be sure to check the local weather conditions before setting out, as this is likely to be a full day's activity. Mahana Beach (Green Sands) is located at South Point, Kau, Hawaii 96737. To get there by car, take Hawaii State Route 11 south from either Hilo or Kailua-Kona to South Point. Turn seaward onto a partially paved dirt road in the Ka Lae area by following signs to the Kaulana Boat Launch. Parking is available down this road, just south of the boat launch. From here, a dirt road leads toward the beach. The entrance is gated and sometimes locked. There are no fences, however, and public access for hikers is available 24/7 throughout the year."
"Mahukona Beach","Hawaii","Mahukona Beach","Mahukona Beach is located at Akoni Pule Highway (270) on the North Kohala Coast, Island of Hawaii and is approximately 35 miles from Keahole Airport. This is strictly speaking a park and despite the name there is actually no beach located here. The site was a former key port for the Kohala Sugar Company but is now an abandoned landing area and picnic site.  Once connected to the sugar mills by rail, the landing area is now popular with local and some tourist as a fishing spot. A ladder can be used to climb in and out of the water to swim here or even spearfish. There are popular snorkeling and diving sports just beyond the landing area. There are some facilities located here including a shower near the landing area ladder as well as portable toilets, a pavilion, picnic tables and barbecue pits. Visitors require a permit to camp on Mahukona Beach's sloping grassy area, where there is some tree cover. It is recommended that campers bring their own water and insect repellent. A little further north, visitors can follow an anchor chain that leads to a submerged boiler and the remains of a ship lying in about 25 foot of water."
"Makaha Beach Park","Hawaii","Makaha Beach Park","Makaha Beach Park is on the west or leeward side of Oahu, Hawaii. The park beach provides good swimming, surfing, and bodyboarding conditions. Swimming is best in summer months because the ocean tends to be calmer, but there are always exceptions to this rule. In winter the surf tends to be filled with rip currents and a strong shorebreak. It is not a good idea to swim in these conditions and it is best that only experienced surfers try their luck with the waves. There may be signs posted all about the beach with regards to the conditions, so pay attention to those or ask the lifeguards that are on duty at this beach park. It is one of the only beaches with lifeguards.  In the middle section of the beach there is no reef thus it is easier to enter the water rather than the northern area which is filled with rocky reef. Also, the northern area is where most surfers hang out. Makaha Beach is on the driest area of the island especially in summer so the sun will beat down. It is necessary to have plenty of sunscreen and water when at this beach along with some shade."
"Makaha Resort & Golf Club","Hawaii","Makaha Resort & Golf Club - Waianae, Hawaii - Secluded Resort with Championship Golf","Golf is a sport just made for the Hawaiian climate, and this is a Hawaiian resort just made for golf. Located in the Makaha Valley, just about 25 minutes from downtown Honolulu, the Makaha Resort & Golf Club is best known for its championship 7,077-yard, par-72 course. The beautiful natural landscape of the Makaha Valley was fully utilized by William F. Bell when he designed the classic 18-hole layout. Every vista is one of splendor, from the rocky cliffs of the Waianae Mountains to the blue Pacific waters of Oahu's western shore A hundred years ago, a ranch occupied this site, where King Kalakaua and his royal family would come for recreation. Peacocks that can still be seen here were a gift to the ranch's owner from the King. With a USGA rating of 73.2, the Makaha golf course presents quite a challenge for both professionals and amateurs. It has been lauded for its beauty and rigor by Golf Digest, and it was named by Honolulu Magazine as the island's top course. Amenities for golfers include a clubhouse with snack bar, a driving range, putting greens, group and private lessons provided by PGA staff, and a full-service pro shop where carts, clubs and shoes can be rented and golf apparel and accessories obtained. All fairways have cart access. Even those who have no interest in golf will find plenty of reasons to enjoy the Makaha Resort. Apart from the magnificent views, the resort has a freshwater outdoor swimming pool open sunrise to sunset, private tennis courts for exclusive guest use, and an activity center. Spa services are also available by appointment. The Makaha Resort & Golf Club counts 173 guest rooms, including 20 one-bedroom, two-bath suites and 3 one-bedroom, full-kitchen suites.

"Makalawena/Pu'u Ali'i Bay","Hawaii","Makalawena/Pu'u Ali'i Bay - Kailua-Kona, Big Island, Hawaii - Hidden White Sand Beach on the Kona Coast","Anyone who has ever dreamed of walking along a perfectly deserted beach of white sands beside crystal blue waters on a tropical afternoon has dreamt of Makalawena Beach. Located on the Big Island's Kona Coast, the beach faces Pu'u Ali'i Bay, and it is so remote from towns and roads that even the local Hawaiians rarely frequent it. Perhaps because it is so unspoiled and uncrowded, many claim that Makalawena should rank among Hawaii's best beaches - or at least its prettiest. Its primary feature is the fine white sand that forms a narrow crescent along the volcanic shoreline. However, it can be very hard to find. To get to Makalawena/Pu'u Ali'i Bay from Kailua-Kona, take State Route 19, the Queen Ka'ahumanu Highway, north to the Kona Coast State Park. The trailhead to the beach is not marked, but it can be found between mile markers 89 and 90 on the ocean side of the highway. Vehicles are not permitted off road here, so visitors should be prepared to leave their cars on the shoulder of the road or at the Park's north parking lot and hike in. It is advisable to bring good shoes, plenty of drinking water and sunscreen for the trek. The walk from the highway to the shore takes a good 15-25 minutes. The rough, crunchy lava trail passes through undeveloped volcanic terrain, marked only by wild trees and shrubs. It eventually emerges through a series of low, rolling sand dunes at the beach. Visitors are immediately stuck by the beauty of the pure white sand and the incredible solitude. The wind, waves and calling birds are the only sounds audible, and the only footprints you will see in the sand may quite likely be your own. Bordering the beach, the random combination of black lava and white, dead coral rocks may appear almost Zen-like in its starkness. The waters here do not have high surf, but they can be good for boogie boarding. A more common pastime is snorkeling. The shallows about six feet from the shore are teeming with tropical fish and sea turtles. Surrounding the sand dunes that frame the beach are numerous shade trees. A bit farther inland, on the other side of the trees, you may come across a natural freshwater pool where it is possible to rinse off the salt and sea from the bay. There are no bathrooms or shower stalls, no life guards or toilets, so come prepared for any eventuality. When asked why more people do not visit this hidden gem, locals note the abundance of more easily accessible beaches in the area, such as Kekaha Kai Beach with its picnic facilities, restrooms and granular white sand and the crescent cove of Mahaiula Beach, which also boasts powdery white sand, turtles and good snorkeling. Nevertheless, the seclusion of Makalawena Beach is one of its greatest attractions. There is also an archaeological site in the Pu'u Ali'i area, which is being excavated by researchers from the Bishop Museum. It might someday prove to be a tourist draw, too."
"Makalei Hawaii Country Club","Hawaii","Makalei Hawaii Country Club","Makalei Hawaii Country Club is one of the golf courses with a country club on the Big Island of Hawaii. The country club is near Kona, and close to many of the Kona hotels. Guests of the island are welcome to enjoy the country club as it is open for public reservations. Tee times do need to be reserved.  Makalei Golf Club is on the western slopes of the Hualalai Mountain, which means there is a natural and raw beauty to the course. It includes native forests, the mountains, cinder cones, and lava tubes. Makalei has challenges for all levels of golfers including multiple tees from 5,242 yards to 7,091 yards depending on entry level or championship level players. Bent grass is found at this course, which is unusual for Hawaii. The sand used in the bunkers was brought in from Idaho making it high grade sand. Makalei is not only home to great golfing, but home to wild pheasants, peacocks, and turkeys. In fact a number of other small animals tend to grace the courts during certain seasons. While playing, visitors can enjoy the ambiance and the golf course as they play the challenges."
"Makamakaole Trail","Hawaii","Makamakaole Trail","Makamakaole Trail in Maui, Hawaii is also known as Waihee Right Trail. The trail leads to Makamakaole Falls, which is considered a rare waterfall in West Maui because you do not need a helicopter to see it. It is one of the only waterfalls that one can hike to. The falls are 270 feet tall. The waterfalls are a part of Makamakaole Stream. There are several tiers to the waterfall. It is possible to see the falls from Kahekili Highway for those who do not want to hike up close. The country route 340 takes visitors along Maui's northwest coast. Past mile marker 8 one can see the waterfall by looking down into the valley from the car. Sometimes only the lower part of the falls is visible unless one hikes up the trail. The trail is as interesting as the fall one can see from it.  The trail takes visitors through the rainforest with several flora and fauna species to spot while taking the trek. Occasionally small animals can also be seen on the trail. It is a moderate trail with some uphill requirements. It is best to bring water and a snack during the mile hike up to the falls."
"Makapu'u Beach Park","Hawaii","Makapu'u Beach Park - Waimanalo, Hawaii - Where Locals Go for Body-Surfing","If there are any beaches on Oahu that tourists have not overrun, Makapu'u may be among the last of them. Makapu'u Beach Park has long been considered a kama'aina (local residents) hangout. The presence of riptides, strong waves and jellyfish makes swimming or surfing here a challenge for all but the most experienced. According to Hawaiian legends, a supernatural being traveled from Tahiti to Oahu and made this coastline her home. She was called Makapu'u, meaning bulging eye,'' because her face was said to have eight bright eyes. This beach and the lighthouse prominence to the south, Makapu'u Point, take their names from her. Makapu'u Beach Park is located along the Kalanianaole Highway en route to Waimanalo further up the East Coast. Just offshore are two islands, Kaohikaipu (Bird) and Manana (Rabbit), which provide a scenic vista. The Pacific waters that surround them are known as the Kaiwi Channel, which separates Oahu from Molokai Island. Currents here can be quite strong year round, but especially so in winter, when rough seas toss high waves to the shore. Local surfers tell many tales of Makapu'u Beach, describing as a paradise'' in one breath and a nightmare'' in the next. The actual beachfront is rather small compared to others in the vicinity, such as Sandy Beach or Waimanalo. It is framed by jagged volcanic rocks on one side and an islet on the other. But the water is impeccably blue, and the waves range from big to towering. Winds from the northeast are present 90 percent of the year. Even the two- to three-foot waves can be quite powerful, and they often come in rapid succession. For this reason, standard surfboards are less favored here. Instead, body-surfing and body-boarding are the preferred activities, and locals make a real sport of it. When not riding to shore on their stomachs alone, they will catch the waves with body-boards or kick-boards and sometimes even cafeteria trays borrowed'' from school lunchrooms. The favorite of Makapu'u Beach surf riders are paipo boards - short, prone-ridden surf-craft that are neither inflatable mats nor traditional soft, finless body-boards. They include small foam/fiberglass belly-boards with surfboard fins, as well as the original finless wooden boards created in Hawaii. Most body-boarders advise using the ones without skegs for the best rides. Compared to the fine sands of Waikiki, the sand here may seem rather grainy. However, this is another reason why locals like Makapu'u Beach; they say walking on the coarse sand makes the soles of their feet baby soft.'' For those who may not enjoy getting beat up by powerful waves, swallowing salt water, and being tossed like flotsam to shore, Makapu'u Beach Park still has its allure. The scenery has been described as somewhere between absolutely beautiful'' and gorgeous.'' Artists like to come here to paint seascapes, photographers love the oceanic sunrises, and picnickers appreciate the privacy of an uncrowded locale. Lifeguards are on duty throughout the year. Phones, showers and restrooms are near at hand. One caution is to look out for the Portuguese man-o-war, a stinging blue jellyfish that seems to enjoy the waters here. Encounters with these can be very painful, and perhaps even deadly. Special signs will be posted by the lifeguards if the man-o-wars start to swarm. Observe the instructions and stay out of the water at such times."
"Makapu'u Point","Hawaii","Makapu'u Point - Honolulu, Hawaii - Oahu's Eastern Tip Features a Lighthouse","Makapu'u Point is the easternmost point on the island of Oahu, located at its southeastern corner. It is marked by a much-photographed lighthouse and can be reached via a short hike along a paved trail. Hawaiian legends tell of a supernatural being that arrived on Oahu from Tahiti and made this rocky prominence her home. Her name was Makapu'u, which means bulging eye,'' a reference to the eight bright eyes appearing on her face. On October 1, 1909, a lighthouse began operation here, adding another bright, budging eye to the point, with the largest lighthouse lens in any United States territory. Although off limits to civilians and locked behind three security gates, the Makapu'u Lighthouse still serves as a tourist attraction as well as a functional landmark. It is owned by the U.S. Coast Guard and has been outfitted for unmanned, automated operation since 1974. The mile-long hike to Makapu'u Point is entirely uphill and quite steep in places. The path is actually the lighthouse service road, and is closed to all but foot traffic. Cars must be parked along the street near the trailhead. A short way up the paved path, a grassy trail leads down toward a rock formation called Pele's Chair.'' This branch trail is all that remains of the Kings Highway,'' an ancient path that once circled the entire island of Oahu. This portion of it terminates at a lookout near sea level. Further up the main route, another unpaved path descends to a rocky peninsula where large tide pools can be seen close up. A small blow hole can be seen shooting up sea spray like a whale spouting water into the air. Most visitors bypass the branch trails and continue straight to the top of the 647-foot bluff. Here, they are treated to a close-up view of the lighthouse and a spectacular panorama of the ocean, coastal mountains, the Windward islands, and the Mokapu Peninsula jutting out into the Pacific. Other points of interest that can be viewed from here are Mt. Olomana rising like a church spire, volcanic Koko Head Crater, and the long pier of the Makai Undersea Test Range research facility. Offshore are picturesque Manana Island (Rabbit Island) and smaller Kaohikaipu Island just below, as well as the island of Molokai, 25 miles in the distance. From December through April, great Humpback whales travel the Molokai Channel (aka Kaiwi Channel), making Makapu'u Point an excellent venue for whale watching. High-power stationary binoculars are available here. Dolphin and sea turtles can often be seen from this vantage point, too, as can hang-gliders launched further down the coast. The two-mile round-trip hike to Makapu'u Point has been graded as easy-to-moderate and takes from 45 minutes to an hour each way. Visitors are advised to start before noon to avoid the heat, bring bottled water and wear sunscreen. A hat may come in handy, too, although it should fit snuggly as winds can be quite gusty at the top. There are no restrooms along the trail or at the lookout point; neither are there any shaded areas. The lava rock from which the precipice is formed can be slippery, even when dry, so hikers are cautioned to remain on the trails. One other good tip is to visit Makapu'u Point before dawn to watch the sun rise over the Pacific, and be sure to bring a camera to capture the event. From Honolulu, take the H1 east till it becomes Highway 72. The trailhead is well marked, half a mile past the Hawaii Kai Golf Course."

"Makena Resort, South Course, Kihei, Maui, Hawaii - A Rather Open, Forgiving Golf Course with views of the Ocean and Mountains","Hawaii","Makena Resort, South Course, Kihei, Maui, Hawaii - A Rather Open, Forgiving Golf Course with views of the Ocean and Mountains","The South Course at Makena Resort is a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. design that underwent renovations in 2008-2009. The renovated South Course now combines a new and old set of nines, features rolling fairways, and makes use of the natural terrain and flora, as well as ocean and mountain views to deliver a truly distinctive experience. The course now plays to 7,019 yards from the tips and is the home to the Hawaii Open golf tournament and others. The design is rather open and forgiving, with stunning views of Mount Haleakala in one direction and the ocean in the other, and fast, undulating greens that provide plenty of challenge. A number of holes are especially noteworthy, including No. 10. This hole was voted one of the top par-5s in Hawaii in the PGA Aloha Section. The hole is a visual treat, with a view of the Puu Olai cinder cone in the background. The hole features water on the right off the tee, as well as on the left as golfers approach the hole. Another noteworthy hole is No. 15, a par-3 that plays to 188 yards and right up to the ocean. Depending on pin placement and ocean winds, the diagonal green guarded by a bunker on the left makes for a picturesque and challenging hole. The signature hole of the South Course is its par-4 No. 16, which runs parallel to the ocean. The hole features a dogleg right, then plays to a two-tiered green that slopes away, calling for an accurate approach shot. As golfers play this hole, it's not uncommon to see humback whales cresting the water during the winter months. Some of the honors and awards for the Makena Resort include a Silver Medal from GOLF Magazine for Best Resort; Golf Digest's Places to Play - 4 stars and a Top 10 ranking in Hawaii; a Golden Tee Award from Meetings and Conventions magazine; and a ranking in the Top 100 resorts from The Golfer.

"Mauna Kea Golf Course","Hawaii","Mauna Kea Golf Course, Kohala Coast, Hawaii - Hawaii's First Great Golf Course","As the story goes, course designer Robert Trent Jones, Sr. said when looking at the future site of the proposed 3rd hole: Mr. Rockefeller, if you allow me to build a golf course here, this'll be the most beautiful hole in the world.'' The Mauna Kea Golf Course subsequently opened in 1964, setting the standard, as Hawaii's first great golf course,'' by which all other Hawaiian courses would be judged. The course has since been updated by Rees Jones, son of the original designer. The younger Jones maintained the essential character of his father's design, but re-planted the championship course with more efficient ultra-dwarf Tifeagle Bermuda grass on the greens, and Tifway 419 hybrid Bermuda grass on the tees, fairways and roughs. He also added state-of-the-art irrigation systems, liners in the bunkers, and advancements to the drainage system to keep the course in prime condition. Rees Jones also increased the number of bunkers to 99 and added another 200 yards to the overall course length. From the back tees, the 18-hole, par-72 course now plays to 7,370 yards with a USGA course rating of 77.2 and a slope rating of 136. The 3rd hole remains one of Mauna Kea's signature holes - a daunting Par 3 at up to 272 yards that plays from a cliff-side tee across a large inlet of the Pacific Ocean to a cliff-side green situated on a finger of lava surrounded by seven bunkers. Either golfers clear the ocean with their tee shot, or they're wet. The ocean winds are almost always working against that happening, and the sound of waves pounding against the rocks makes for an added distraction. Just as original course designer Robert Trent Jones, Sr. envisioned, however, the hole remains one of the most beautiful and most photographed in the golfing world. The course continues to receive honors and awards, including being named to the Top 50 Resort Courses, Readers Choice Awards,'' by Golf World magazine, 2008; making the Platinum List, Top 20 Golf Courses,'' by Celebrated Living, 2009; and being ranked #31 among America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses'' by Golf Digest, 2007. Practice facilities include a driving range and putting greens. Lessons are available from PGA Professionals for private and group lessons, as well as clinics.

The Number 3'' clubhouse restaurant has also been updated with a new look, and features tasty cuisine and drinks in a casual atmosphere.

"Mauna Kea Observatories","Hawaii","Mauna Kea Observatories","Mauna Kea Observatories are located on the summit of Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaii and are approximately two hour's drive from Hilo International Airport. The 4,200 meter summit of Mauna Kea is home to the world's largest observatory for optical, infrared and submillimeter astronomy. Guided tours of the observatories are offered from the visitor center lower down the mountain.  Drivers of 4-wheel drive vehicles can take the escorted tour on Saturdays and Sundays from 1pm, which take them from the visitor center to the summit. This is an international astronomical site with telescopes owned by various nations. For example the James Clerk Maxwell telescope is operated by the UK, Canada and the Netherlands and is the largest astronomical telescope in the world. The W.M Keck Observatory houses the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, which both stand eight stories tall and weigh 300 tons. In total there are 13 working telescopes near the summit of this dormant volcano. It is recommended that visitors begin their tour of the observatories at the Visitor Information Station of the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy, which is located further down the mountain.

"Mauna Kea Summit","Hawaii","Mauna Kea Summit - Kona-Kailua, Big Island, Hawaii - Hawaii's Tallest Peak and Astronomy Hub","At a height of 4,205 meters (13,796 feet), Mauna Kea is Hawaii's tallest peak. It was formed through volcanic activity thousands of years ago, and although long dormant, it remains one of the Big Island's most visited sites, as home to the world's largest observatory for optical, infrared, and sub-millimeter astronomy. A typical trip to the Mauna Kea Summit takes about three hours one-way and begins in the mid-afternoon from Hilo, Kailua-Kona or Waikoloa. The mountain is easily reached from Saddle Road (State Route 200), by turning up Mauna Kea Access Road near mile marker #28. Six miles along this road on the right is the Visitor Information Station (VIS) at an elevation of about 9,300 feet. In addition to providing tourist information about Mauna Kea and its observatory, a bookstore, a sundries shop, and public restrooms are located here. Mauna Kea may be dormant, but it is by no means desolate. A number of feral animals may be observed along the way. These include wild pigs, goats, sheep, donkey, mongoose, and cats. Some native species make their home here, too, such as the Pueo (Hawaiian owl), Nene (goose), I'o (hawk), Golden Plover and Hoary bat. The road up the mountain is steep, rising another 4,500 feet from the VIS, and it takes a circular course. Four-wheel drive is a must. The view en route reveals the island's beauty, including the ocean and resort areas on the west side of Hawaii and the city of Hilo to the east. Active volcano Mauna Loa can be seen to the south. At the posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour, it takes about half an hour to reach the summit from the VIS. It is best to arrive at the top about a half hour before sunset. This affords the best views of dusk over the Pacific, the lights coming on in the cities and the stars coming out overhead. It also allows some time to look around at the telescope facilities that dot the peak. The Mauna Kea Observatories include 13 large research telescopes. Among these is the 8.1-meter Gemini, built and operated by a partnership of seven countries. There are also two 10-meter telescopes operated by Caltech. Some scheduled tours allow viewing of the heavens through these powerful scientific instruments. It can be quite cold and blustery atop Mauna Kea, so bringing along a parka and some gloves is highly recommended. Also, the air is quite thin up here, with 40% less oxygen and 40% less air pressure than at sea level. For this reason, anyone with lung problems or heart disease may be ill-advised to make the trip. Star-gazing is, of course, the main attraction at the summit. Mauna Kea is so close to the equator that virtually all of the stars of the Northern Hemisphere plus some 70% of those of the Southern Hemisphere can be seen from this point. For many, it may be their first viewing of the Southern Cross, rising above the horizon to the south as night progresses. Visiting with an experienced local guide provides a wonderful opportunity to learn the names of stars and constellations, not only in Latin and English but in Hawaiian language as well. Tours to the top of Mauna Kea can be booked through Mauna Kea Summit Adventures at 74-5606 Pawai Place, Kailua Kona, Hawaii 96740. The cost per person, including roundtrip transportation, dinner, all taxes and user fees, is $197. During busy periods, such as summer vacation and year-end holidays, visitors are advised to make reservations at least 30 days in advance."

"Mauna Lani Resort Golf Club","Hawaii","Mauna Lani Resort Golf Club - Kamuela, Big Island, Hawaii - Championship Golf on the Kohala Coast","The Mauna Lani Resort Golf Club offers players the option of two championship golf courses, plus a course specifically designed for juniors aged 18 and under. The Club is part of the Mauna Lani Resort, but golfers need not be guests of the hotel to use the facilities. Both of the Club's top-flight courses are named after Francis H. I'i Brown, the Big Island's territorial representative in the early 20th century. Brown was an avid golfer, adventurer and sports fisherman who acquired the land in order to develop it for golf in the 1930s. The fairways and greens were remarkably constructed amid dark black lava fields, and the original 18-hole course opened in 1981 to rave reviews. The Mauna Lani Resort Golf Club received Golf Magazine's Gold Medal Award every year from 1988 on. It has been played by such gold legends as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Raymond Floyd, Chi Chi Rodriquez, Gary Player, and Hale Irwin, to name but a few. The current North Course represents Hawaiian golf at its best. Its grassy layout atop the lava bed features rolling terrain and Kiawe (mesquite) forests. The par-three 17th hole is its signature challenge, nestled within a natural lava amphitheater. The course is also bordered by a 230-acre protected archaeological district to the north, where herds of feral goats are sometime encountered. The South Course is similarly positioned with lava formations and palm trees marking its perimeter. This was the home of the annual Senior Skins Game for eleven consecutive years, from 1990 to 2000. The course snakes through the rugged lava flows to offer players unmatched views of the Big Island's mountains and oceans. Its 15th hole ranks among the world's most photographed over-the-water golf course holes. For younger players, the Club's nine-hole Keiki Golf Course is the only one of its kind in Hawaii, especially designed for children and teens. It offers the opportunity for youngsters to learn and enjoy golf without the challenges of a full-scale 18-hole course. For beginners, lessons are available. An adult must accompany Keiki golfers under the age of 14. Apart from the golf courses themselves, the Club also features a Golf Academy with a variety of private lessons and clinics. These range from a simple half-hour of instruction to special classes for families, covering a full range of golf topics, from an introduction to the game to putting, full swing, and actual practice on the course's signature holes. A Pro Shop is located on site, selling the latest golf and resort wear. There are such name-brand products as Nike, Polo, Greg Norman, Tommy Bahama Golf, Tori Richards and others. Besides apparel, the shop offers golf equipment, including hybrid woods, iron sets, drivers, wedges and putters, as well as golf balls, caps and leather gloves.

"Mauna Lani Resort, North Course, Kohala Coast, Hawaii - Great Golf and Panoramic Views of the Ocean and Mountains","Hawaii","Mauna Lani Resort, North Course, Kohala Coast, Hawaii - Great Golf and Panoramic Views of the Ocean and Mountains","The Mauna Lani Resort boasts two golf course, with the North Course considered the more challenging and the one coveted by better players. The course is carved from the top of an ancient lava flow of sinuous, brown forms of pahoehoe (smooth lava), and features lush, rolling fairways and inviting greens. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a maximum length of 6,938 yards with a USGA rating of 73.2 and a slope rating of 133. One of the biggest challenges for golfers is keeping the ball in the short Bahia grass on a course where groves of twisted kiawe (mesquite) trees abound on nearly every hole. Herds of feral goats also frequent the course, and golfers must be aware of such wildlife as the beasts move from hole to hole. Some of the more noteworthy holes include the course's signature hole and one of the most distinctive. The par-3 No. 17 begins on an elevated tee that plays to a wide green situated like a bowl amid an amphitheater'' formed of intimidating lava rock. At a mere 144 yards, golfers might be tempted to take this hole lightly. But a large bunker guards the front of what appears to be an inviting green, and ever-present and shifting trade winds add to the challenge. Another noteworthy hole is No. 9, a long par-4 that plays toward the ocean. A wayward shot to the left is out of bounds as golfers approach the green, which is guarded on the right by water. Because of its length, 415 yards from the middle tees, most golfers face a daunting, full-approach shot to have any hope of making par. Hole No. 14 is a short par-3 that plays to only 131 yards from the back tees. The challenge comes, however, as golfers tee off from a bluff to a green 30 feet below. The green is guarded by sand and water on the right as the putting surface juts into the hazard. Mauna Lani Resort has received a Gold Medal Award from GOLF Magazine every year since 1988, and also played host to the Senior Skins Golf Game for 11 years. The Mauna Lani Resort Golf Shop carries the latest in equipment and apparel, and the resort also offers instruction at its Mauna Lani Golf Academy.

It states the pond was built by Menehune, who are supposedly leprechaun like people. It was built in one brightly lit night. Archeologists have a different idea of the pond. They have dated it pre-Hawaii by at least 1,000 years.  The pond is fed by Hule'ia Stream. There is a wall between the stream and pond, which runs 900 feet in length.

"Menehune Mac Factory Gift Center","Hawaii","Menehune Mac Factory Gift Center, Honolulu, Hawaii - The Place for Handcrafted Chocolates and More","As the oldest manufacturer of chocolate-covered macadamia nut candies in Hawaii, Menehune Mac has been in business since 1939. The business was sold to Patrick Arakaki and his family in 1972. During the 1990s, it was briefly owned by a Tokyo-based liquor distributor, Kawami Co., until it was resold to the Arakaki's in 2000. Today, Patrick's son, Neal Arakaki, serves as the company's president. Under the Arakaki's, Menehune Mac has focused on the production of higher-end candies, suited to the tastes of Japanese tourists. They developed a dark, rich, handmade chocolate in contrast to the lighter milk chocolate versions offered by their competitors. At one point, 90 percent of their sales were focused on Japan and markets of the Far East. After the events of September 11, 2001, however, Japanese tourism declined in Hawaii and the demand for local chocolates fell sharply. The Arakaki's had to diversify, concentrating their marketing efforts on exports to buyers in the continental U.S., where their products have been well received. Today, producing some one and a half million to two million pounds of chocolate a year, Menehune Mac ranks among the largest producers of handmade chocolate in the world. The Menehune Mac Factory Gift Center is the focal point of operations in Honolulu, where visitors and members of the local community can experience the art of chocolate making firsthand. Apart from chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, still a staple of the Menehune Mac Factory, the Gift Center offers cookies, Maui jams and jellies, coffees, teas, nuts and candies that are sugar-free. Items are packaged as gift baskets or party favors, as well individually, and private-label branding is available for larger orders. Among the most popular items are Chocolate Macadamia Nut Wholes and Halves, priced from $3 to $7 per box of two to eight ounces. The chocolate is said to have an especially creamy texture and a flavor that lingers. Its extra richness comes from heating and mixing the chocolate in small batches, which yields a more complete melt and blend. Another top-seller contains no chocolate. It is Pineapple Snow, a vanilla confection flavored with pineapple essence and paired with dry roasted Hawaiian macadamia nuts. According to at least one satisfied customer, This is the best piece of candy I have ever eaten.'' Apart from selling products at the Menehune Mac Factory Gift Center, the Arakaki's allow visitors to watch the chocolate being made as part of a free factory tour. As part of The Chocolate Experience,'' which takes about 45 minutes, participants are invited to create their own boxes of handmade chocolates. Events are frequently set up to give local residents - and school-age children, in particular - the opportunity to make their own confections, too.

"Mokuleia Beach","Hawaii","Mokuleia Beach","Mokuleia Beach is also called Slaughterhouse Beach.

It was torn down in the 60s, but the name Slaughterhouse stuck even though Mokuleia is also a name for the same beach. Mokuleia is prettier meaning district of abundance. The name is not as important as the enjoyment one can find on the beach though. Slaughterhouse Beach is near Kapalua on Maui. It is located on the north shore with a secluded area formed by sea cliffs allowing for a small area of white sand. In winter surfing is a popular sport at this beach. It is because the waves tend to pound on the cliffs, but in summer the water is calm making it a great place for surfing, bodyboarding, swimming, and snorkeling.  The waters are part of a marine preserve meaning fishing and spearing is not allowed at the beach. Harming any marine life is against the law.

"Nuuanu Pali Lookout","Hawaii","Nuuanu Pali Lookout - Honolulu, Hawaii - Panoramic Views of Oahu's Windward Coast","Nuuanu Pali Lookout affords visitors some of the most spectacular views Oahu has to offer. Located midway between Honolulu and the Windward Coast, this scenic stop is perched along a mountain pass at a height of 1,186 feet above sea level. On either side of it are peaks reaching elevations above 3,000 feet. The 985-foot cliffs of the Koolau Mountain Range flank Nuuanu Pali Lookout, the name of which means Cool Height Cliff.'' Off to the northeast is Kaneohe Bay, where the cone-shaped volcanic island known as Chinaman's Hat can be seen. The towns of Kaneohe and Kailua shimmer in the distance, and the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean serves as a backdrop to it all. But Nuuanu Pali Lookout is more than just a sightseeing location. It once played a historic role in the development of the Hawaiian Islands. Back in 1795, King Kamehameha I led his 10,000 warriors in their final battle here, defeating the armies of Oahu by driving them over the steep, forested cliffs. According to legend, on certain nights the screams of the vanquished can still be heard here. In fact, workers actually did unearth skulls during road construction in 1848, and they are believed to be the remains of those hapless Oahu warriors. The significance of this particular battle is still taught in Hawaiian schools. Kamehameha's victory at Nuuanu Pali brought about the unification of all the islands as a single kingdom, the legacy of which is the 50th star on the United States flag. Apart from the breathtaking scenery and the venue's role in local history, the most remarkable aspect of a visit to Nuuanu Pali Lookout is the strong trade winds that blow through the pass like air forced through a wind tunnel. On especially windy days, it is possible to lean into the gusts and let them hold you up. Wearing a light jacket is highly recommended. The breezes have been known to sweep away hats, sunglasses and even hairpieces, so be sure to remove headgear before venturing out. Small children should be held by the hand and any pets kept on a leash, in order to avoid potentially tragic occurrences. From the lower end of the lookout, it is possible to hike a short trail and get different perspectives on the view of the Windward Coast. Photographers looking for the best angles will certainly want to give this a try. A wide variety of plants flank the trail, too, and it is not unusual to see seabirds gilding on the wind currents up above as if motionless. Owing to the strong winds, a particularly interesting optical illusion can also be seen near Nuuanu Pali Lookout - the 200-foot Upside Down Waterfall'' cascading from the summit of 3,150-foot Mount Konahuanui. On the windiest of days, the descending waters appear to be flowing up, rather than down. The journey to Nuuanu Pali Lookout is an easy one, following the eastbound H1 highway from Waikiki to Pali Highway Route 61 and Nuuanu Pali Drive. Well-posted signs direct visitors to the lookout, which is open to the public from 9am to 4pm daily, weather permitting. Admission is free, as is parking.

"One Ali'i Fishpond","Hawaii","One Ali'i Fishpond","One Ali'i Fishpond is located at One Ali'i Park off Highway 450 in Kaunakakai on the island of Molokai in Hawaii and is approximately 20 minute's drive from Molokai Airport. The island is the fifth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and is 38 by 10 miles in size. One Ali'i Fishpond, which is also known as One Ali'i Beach Park is located on the south coast of the island.   The beach park is often called the fishpond due to the fact that the island's royalty once fished here. Nowadays this remote island beach is very popular with bird watchers as well as kite fliers as the area is generally windy. The sand on the beach is a dark gold fine grain and the palm trees and grass by the shoreline make this a picturesque setting. The sea can be rough in the windy conditions and therefore not ideal for swimming, although it is good for paddling as the water is shallow here. Visitors to the beach will find a few amenities including grills making this a nice spot to bring a picnic. Restrooms and showers are also available here. Dogs are allowed on the beach but must be kept on a leash at all times."
"Onizuka Astronomy Complex","Hawaii","Onizuka Astronomy Complex - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Home to Professional Star Gazers","At 13,796 feet, the summit of Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii houses the world's largest observatory for optical, infrared, and sub-millimeter astronomy. Because of the extreme altitude here, astronomers and technicians must acclimatize and live at an intermediate altitude, so living facilities were constructed in 1982 at a lower elevation, 9,300 feet, at the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy, informally known as the Onizuka Astronomy Complex. As an astronomy site, Mauna Kea is almost perfect. The mountain atmosphere is extremely dry and cloud-free. The area's proportion of clear nights ranks among the highest in the world. Also, a tropical inversion cloud layer exists at 2,000 feet, insulating the upper atmosphere from moist maritime air, city lights, and atmospheric pollutants. The community at the Onizuka Astronomy Complex is truly international. The 13 research telescopes atop Mauna Kea are operated by representatives of nearly a dozen countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A number of universities and private institutions are also represented. They include Caltech, the University of California, the University of Hawaii, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), among others. Nine of telescopes atop Mauna Kea are intended for optical and infrared astronomy. Three others are used for sub-millimeter wavelength astronomy, and there is one dedicated to radio astronomy. Caltech's two Keck models are the largest optical/infrared telescopes in the world, each with a mirror diameter of 10 meters. The very first telescope set up here was the University of Hawaii's 0.6-meter version for educational use in 1968. The most recent addition is the Smithsonian's 8x6-meter sub-millimeter array, completed in 2002. The Hale Pohaku (Hawaiian for stone house'') of the Onizuka Astronomy Complex can accommodate up to 72 people working at the summit. There is also a visitor center, which is open to the public year round, and a number of support buildings for maintenance, storage and meetings. At the Visitor Information Station (VIS), nightly stargazing tours have been organized between 6pm and 10pm. A solar telescope with protective filters has been set up for daytime viewing. The VIS also operates weekend tours to the summit, where visitors can peer through the huge telescopes and observe the heavens. Other features of the Onizuka Astronomy Complex include a bookstore, public restrooms, and a sundries shop. Hot water and a microwave oven are also provided for use by visitors. However, there are no gas stations closer than 30 miles, so those coming to the complex by car are advised to fuel up before setting out for a visit. The Onizuka Astronomy Complex is about an hour's drive from Hilo. Drivers should take the Puainako Extension to Saddle Road (State Highway 200) and then turn right, just before mile marker #28, onto Mauna Kea Access Road.'' Six miles along, the VIS can be seen on the right side of the road."
"Onizuka Center for International Astronomy - Hilo","Hawaii","Onizuka Center for International Astronomy - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii Where Visitors Can Observe the Stars","Named after Colonel Ellison S. Onizuka, Hawaii's first NASA astronaut, the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy is the primary destination for those who wish to experience the wonders of astronomy at Hawaii's finest observatory. The Center's Visitor Information Station (VIS) is located at the 9,300-foot level of Mauna Kea. A plaque showing Onizuka's face can be seen mounted on a boulder just outside the entrance. The VIS is open from 9am to 10pm, 365 days a year. Staff members are on duty, along with Mauna Kea Rangers, to answer any questions visitors may have. From 10am to 10pm, telescopes are also available for public use here. One popular feature of the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy is its free Stargazing Program. From 6pm to 10pm nightly, the public is invited to view the heavens with trained observers. The program begins with a short documentary film about Mauna Kea made by PBS Hawaii. Entitled First Light,'' it delves into the history of the volcanic mountain from astronomical and cultural perspectives. After the film, visitors go outside on the VIS lanai. There, a number of telescopes have been set up by staff and volunteers for star viewing. Throughout the evening, various objects in the night sky can be seen through the lenses, including planets, galaxies, open clusters of stars, globular clusters, double stars, nebulae, and supernova remnants. The staff members also provide a star tour using a laser pointer. They point out the various constellations and bright objects that are visible on any given night. Another popular feature of the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy is the Summit Tour Program held on weekends. Participants must arrive at the VIS by 1:00 PM on Saturday or Sunday in order to join the caravan to the top of Mauna Kea. Four-wheel vehicles are recommended, as the route can be quite steep in places and slippery with ice in the winter months. Following a brief orientation at the VIS, the drive to the summit takes about half an hour, following the posted speed limit of 25 miles an hour. The tour stops at least one of the Mauna Kea Observatories to observe the heavens through one of the large telescopes, such as the 8.1-meter Gemini or one of two 10-meter telescopes operated by Caltech. The formal tour concludes around 4:30 pm, when participants may return or stay a little longer at the summit. Throughout the day, a solar telescope is provided for viewing at the VIS. It has been aimed at the sun and equipped with protective filters. The VIS has a bookstore and food for sale, and hot water containers are provided along with a microwave for visitors' convenience. Restrooms are also available here 24 hours a day. To get to the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy Visitor Information Station from Hilo, drivers should take the Puainako Extension to Saddle Road (State Highway 200). Just before mile marker #28, a road appears to the right with a sign that says Mauna Kea Access Road.'' Follow this road six miles to the VIS on the right side of the road. The drive takes about one hour from Hilo, and coming with a full tank of gas is highly recommended. Fuel is not available for purchase on Mauna Kea, and the nearest gas stations are about 30 miles away. Onizuka Center for International Astronomy also has a business office in Hilo where administrative functions are carried out and mail is delivered. The address is 177 Maka'ala Street, Hilo, Island of Hawaii, Hawaii 96720-5148."
"Onizuka Space Center","Hawaii","Onizuka Space Center - Kona, Big Island, Hawaii - Tribute to an Astronaut and Space Exploration","The Onizuka Space Center is located within Kona International Airport on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is dedicated to the memory of Colonel Ellison S. Onizuka, a NASA astronaut who died on January 28, 1986, when the Challenger Space Shuttle exploded shortly after launch. Onizuka was born on June 24, 1946, in Kealakekua, Kona, Hawaii. He graduated from Konawaena High School in Kealakekua and went on to the University of Colorado, where he received his bachelor and master of science degrees in aerospace engineering in 1969. He was a distinguished ROTC military graduate and entered active duty with the United States Air Force in January 1970. In the mid-1970s, Onizuka attended the USAF Test Pilot School. He served at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was a squadron flight test engineer. Later, he was promoted to chief of the engineering support section in the training resources branch. Hawaiians are proud of Onizuka's selection as a candidate for NASA's astronaut training program in January 1978. He went on to become the payload specialist for the Space Shuttle Discovery and logged 74 hours in space as the vessel orbited the earth 48 times in January 1985. Tragically, Onizuka was on board the Challenger that fateful day when it exploded, just one minute and 13 seconds after launch. He was posthumously promoted to the rank of Colonel and awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. The non-profit Onizuka Space Center was created within the Kona International Airport as an educational facility dedicated to the memory of Hawaii's first astronaut. Its two-story museum contains a number of interactive exhibits and videos that describe the history and physics of manned space flight. Also portrayed are the details of daily life in space. Many of the personal items of Ellison S. Onizuka are on display here. Other exhibits include space-related concepts, a sample of lunar soil, an Apollo 13 space suit, and several other collections related to space exploration. There are both permanent and rotating temporary exhibitions, and a library of books on space is open to the public. The center conducts a number of programs and tours, too. School excursions are frequently organized, as are teacher workshops, teacher training programs, demonstrations, and interactive multimedia presentations for public use. Films are shown in the Center's 45-seat theater. Information on self-guided tours can be obtained at the visitor center. Each July, a special anniversary event is held to celebrate the opening of the facility. Each January, a commemorative event is conducted in remembrance of Onizuka and the rest of the Challenger crew. Friends of the Onizuka Space Center offer memberships for individuals for $20 and families for $35 each. Gift and souvenir items are sold in the Center's museum store, and the proceeds go toward supporting the Center. The Onizuka Space Center is located within the tall, white building next to the flag poles between the Aloha and Hawaiian Airlines ticket counters at the Kona International Airport. It is open daily from 8:30am to 4:30pm, but closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. Admission is $3 for adults and $1 for children aged 12 and under.

"Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor","Hawaii","Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor - Oahu, Hawaii - Tribute to Air Battles of World War II","The Pacific Aviation Museum is located on Ford Island in the middle of Pearl Harbor. It opened on December 7, 2006, the 65th anniversary of the Japanese bombing raid that launched the United States into war in the Pacific. To get to the museum, visitors must board a shore-side trolley from the Arizona Memorial national park visitor's center just off Kamehameha Highway, eight miles west of Honolulu. The trolley takes them across the Ford Island Bridge and makes a stop at the USS Battleship Missouri before arriving at the site of the old air strip where the museum is situated. The buildings that house the exhibits here are actual World War II hangars; scars from America's first aviation battlefield can still be seen on their exteriors. Tours of the museum begin in 42,000-square-foot Hangar 37, which originally served seaplanes. Just off the museum's lobby, a 200-seat theater launches each tour with a 10-minute movie, showing historic footage of 1941's surprise attack. From the theater, visitors follow a corridor lined with photos depicting what life was like at the naval base on that fateful December day. Sound effects add to the reenactment. The main exhibit area takes up 25,000 square feet. Its centerpiece is a diorama featuring an authentic Japanese Zero. It rests upon the deck of a Japanese aircraft carrier, the Hiryu, waiting to fly at dawn. Also on display is a light civilian plane that was shot down during the attack, plus a P-40 fighter identical to the ones that were based at Wheeler and Haleiwa Field. One exhibit features a Japanese Zero that crash-landed on Niihau Island; plasma screen televisions relate the story of its fate before, during and after the raid. Another diorama shows aircraft from both sides of the conflict suspended in mid-air. As its name implies, the Pacific Aviation Museum commemorates not only the battle that took place at Pearl Harbor, but also aviation history throughout the Pacific. For example, one exhibit centers on an actual B-25B Mitchell Bomber, which is identical to the plane used in April 1942 for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, Japan. Representing the Battle of Midway is an SBD Dauntless dive bomber. For the story of the Cactus Air Force'' at Guadalcanal, an authentic Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat is featured. There is also a tribute to America's mobilization for war, showing how warplanes were made and pilots trained. Presented is the actual Stearman N2S-3 in which former President Bush soloed. On the premises, visitors will also find a gift shop stocked with aviation-related items, the World War II themed Laniakea Caf, with a full lunch menu, and an interactive game arcade with six combat flight simulators. The latter allows guests to fly'' a Zero or Wildcat fighter for a 15-minute dogfight in the skies above Guadalcanal; a pre-flight briefing is included, too. Besides the exhibits, the Pacific Aviation Museum also hosts special events, such as the The Biggest Little Air Show on Ford Island,'' with remote controlled model planes taking the air from old Luke Field. A private room can be rented for up to 120 guests during regular Museum operating hours, or 100~600 for evening activities. Outdoor functions can be catered for groups up to 10,000."

"Pacific Tsunami Museum","Hawaii","Pacific Tsunami Museum - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - A Trove of Tidal Wave Information","On April 1, 1946, and again on May 23, 1960, the city of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii was hit by devastating tidal waves that reshaped the social and economic structure of the community. In order to promote public tsunami education for the people of Hawaii and the Pacific Region, the Pacific Tsunami Museum was formed in 1994 as a non-profit organization. It combines scientific information with oral interviews of tsunami survivors to keep the history of these catastrophic events alive through exhibits and public programs. Tsunami,'' of course, is the Japanese word for tidal wave.'' In the Hawaiian language, two words are actually used to describe this occurrence: kai e'e'' means the wave itself, while kai mimiki'' refers to the withdrawal of water before the kai e'e arrives. Such withdrawal is actually the tsunami's trough before its crest reaches the shore. Inside the Museum, displays have been arranged on a single level. The various exhibits detail the historical tsunamis that Hilo and the rest of Hawaii have encountered. There are also and presentations on tsunamis around the world and efforts currently being undertaken to detect, track, and warn the public about possible tsunamis. A mix of photographs, text and video is used to provide visitors with information. A few of the videos are rather long, but most will be interesting to anyone who has an interest in earthquakes and tsunamis. Those videos showing the tsunami destruction in Hilo are especially poignant, as it is possible to look out the Museum windows and picture the damage and destruction so close at hand. Education is also a major emphasis of the Museum and several programs for community outreach have been arranged. For example, the Museum's curator/archivist Barbara Muffler often talks to local high school and middle school students regarding the science of tsunamis as a way of interesting them in science careers. Similarly, Pacific Tsunami Museum Board President Jim Wilson has spoken before civic groups, such as the Rotary Club, to give a history of the museum and state its goals. The Museum also operates in affiliation with a number of related organizations, including the University of Hawaii, the International Tsunami Information Center, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, and Hawaii's State and County Civil Defense Agencies. As a recent project, the Museum published a booklet for community distribution entitled How to Prepare Your Business for the Next Tsunami - A Guide for Businesses in the Hawaiian Islands.'' The Pacific Tsunami Museum is located right across the street from Hilo Bay in downtown Hilo. A live webcam mounted near its entrance keeps an electronic eye on the bay to watch for tsunamis. Evacuation plans have also been posted conspicuously at the entrance at testament to the Museum's commitment to preparedness. The Pacific Tsunami Museum is open each day from 9am to 4pm. Admission is $7 for adults, $6 for seniors, and $2 for students. Children under age 5 are admitted free of charge. The address is 130 Kamehameha Avenue, Hilo, Hawaii 96721.

"Parker Ranch","Hawaii","Parker Ranch - Kamuela, Big Island, Hawaii - The Largest Cattle Ranch in America","Founded in 1847, the Parker Ranch in Waimea (Kamuela) is not only one of the oldest and most historic ranches in the United States, it is also noted as the country's largest privately-owned cattle enterprise. It covers thousands of acres across the island and is a lasting testament to the pioneering contributions of Hawaiian cowboys - the so-called Paniolo'' - to the culture and growth of the state. John Parker was only nineteen years old when he jumped ship and landed on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1809, just five years after the first horses arrived here. In time, he developed a friendship with King Kamehameha I, who employed him to bring a herd of wild cattle under control. Parker later married Kipikane, the daughter of a Hawaiian chief, in 1815, and they had three children - a daughter and two sons. As the Parker family and their property grew, so did the community of Waimea. By 1832, skilled Latin American vaqueros (cowboys) had arrived to work the cattle ranches and within a few years Hawaii had its own working cowboys. Soon there were blacksmiths, craftsmen, sawyers and tanners plying their trades here. Although many ranches failed in the 19th century, the Parker Ranch survived and thrived, with domesticated longhorns and Herefords as the primary livestock. During World War Two, the military moved onto the Parker land and set up a huge tent city, Camp Tarawa. In the post-War ear, the ranch headquarters was improved, a Visitor Center was constructed, and a museum, a restaurant and a saddle shop were added. Today, the Parker Ranch provides visitors with opportunities to learn about the history and culture of Hawaii and the Paniolo. There are horseback riding tours and All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) tours that take groups through pastureland and past the dormant Mauna Kea volcano. The ranch is also home to an annual Fourth of July Rodeo and the official Paniolo Hall ofFame. The cost for trail rides is $79.00 per person for each of the two rides offered at 8:15am and 12:15pm Monday through Saturday. Each ride lasts about two hours and begins at the Blacksmith Shop on Pukalani Road. Prices are subject to change and do not include Hawaii state tax. Hunting is also permitted on the ranch, and guides are available. The game season is year-round, and pointing dogs can be provided. Besides hunting for such game birds as pheasant, wild turkeys and sand grouse, big game hunting is also possible. There is a 14-point limit on bird hunting and a charge per kill'' on big game, ranging from $525 for a meat pig to $3,500 for a two-day Grand Slam'' that includes harvesting all three permitted big game species - Polynesian Boar, Wild Goat and Wild Cattle. Shopping in the Parker Ranch Store for souvenirs is an essential part of any visit. Among items available are Hawaiian-style beef jerky, Kona coffee and local teas, as well as a variety of local music CDs, island lotions, handcrafted jewelry and upcountry Paniolo apparel.

"Pearl Harbor","Hawaii","Pearl Harbor - Honolulu, Hawaii - Historic Port and Naval Base on Oahu Island","Located eight miles west of Honolulu, Pearl Harbor is home to the largest naval base in the United States. Access to much of the area is restricted to military personnel, but the numerous World War II memorials found here make it one of the most visited tourist sites on the island of Oahu. Roughly two million tourists flock to Pearl Harbor each year. The harbor was discovered'' by British Captain James Cook when he became the first European to voyage to Hawaii in 1778. The area was then known as Wai Momi'' or Pearl Water,'' owing to the abundance of pearl oysters found in its depths. Although Pearl Harbor is Oahu's largest natural harbor, initially only shallow draft vessels could anchor in the waters here. A dead coral reef blocked its entrance. Until the late 19th century, it remained undeveloped, but its strategic location made it attractive as a fuel and supply base, so the United States government negotiated exclusive rights to the port from the Hawaiian monarchy in 1884. In 1900, dredging of the entrance began, and Pearl Harbor grew to become tenth ranked in value among all U.S. naval bases by 1916. Today, it can handle the largest ships in the Navy's fleet, providing a complete range of birthing, shore-side support, and dry dock services. In fact, Pearl Harbor is the only location in the mid-Pacific where submarines can obtain maintenance, so they are often seen moored here alongside surface vessels. As the home to more than 160 military commands, Naval Station Pearl Harbor has extensive housing for members of the armed forces and their families. Its self-contained community also offers a full array of medical, dental, educational, religious and civic services to both permanent and transient personnel. Although this naval base is the only one in the United States designated as a National Historical Landmark, without authorized clearance, tourists cannot pass through Nimitz Gate, the main entrance to the naval station, two miles west of the Honolulu International Airport off Nimitz Highway. Nor can they visit the shipyard located near the Southeast Loch of the harbor. Instead, they will exit to Kamehameha Highway and arrive at the national park area, which is open to the public. Along Arizona Memorial Road and out in the harbor on Ford Island, a number of landmarks are located, paying tribute to those who lost their lives on December 7, 1941, a day that will live in infamy.'' It was at this site that World War II began and ended for the United States. The visitor's center is a good first stop to pick up information on all of the attractions in the area. The Arizona Memorial and Museum gives homage to the USS Arizona, a battleship that was sunk by Japanese bombers, costing 1,177 lives. Nearby, the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and Park allows tours of a historic WWII submarine, along with a 10,000-square-foot exhibit space featuring a collection of submarine-related artifacts, from weaponry to battle flags and detailed models. The shore-side Battleship Missouri Memorial offers shuttle service across the Ford Island Bridge to three more key attractions: the actual remains of the USS Arizona and USS Utah, and the mothballed USS Missouri, where tours are available. Also on Ford Island is the Pacific Aviation Museum. It preserves aircraft flown during World War II, including the Wildcat fighter plane and its opponent, the Japanese Zero."

"Plantation Village","Hawaii","Plantation Village - Waipahu, Hawaii - Outdoor Museum Preserves Ethnic Homes","Hawaii's Plantation Village is an outdoor museum located in historic Waipahu, where sugar was once king. Its purpose is to showcase the lifestyles and experience of Hawaii's sugar plantation workers, displaying furnished homes and community structures of the early 1900s. Managed and operated by the nonprofit Friends of Waipahu Cultural Garden Park, the Village was conceived in 1976, developed over a decade and a half, and opened in September 1992. It now stands on 50 acres of fertile farmland, situated below the Oahu Sugar Mill. Through restored buildings and replicas of homes, it interprets what life was like for the multiethnic groups of laborers who immigrated to Hawaii between the late 1800s and the 1940s. On display here are Asian art and architecture, antiques and relics, along with ethnic dwellings that are the main feature of the Village. Two of the original buildings are listed on the Hawaii Register of Historic Places - the Chinese Cookhouse of 1909 and the Japanese-style Wakamiya Inari Shrine built in 1914. The latter is also on the National Historic Register. Other buildings represent the homes of immigrants from Portugal (1918), Puerto Rico (1900), Japan (1910 and 1930), the Philippines (1935), Korea (1919), and Okinawa (1919). There is a re-created Filipino Dormitory (1919), and local native culture is seen in a thatched-roof Hawaiian Hale that dates back to the 1950s. Besides houses, visitors can gain insight into plantation social life at the Chinese Society Building (1909), the Social Union Hall (1920), and the Community Bathhouse and Barbershop. There is a replica of a Tofu Shop, and a Sumo Ring gives a hint of how workers might have entertained themselves a century ago. Of course, sugar plantations needed management as well as labor, so the Village has preserved a Camp Office (1930) and an Infirmary (1915). Another all-important building is the Plantation Store (1900), where laborers would have bought foodstuffs and dry goods. In total, Hawaii's Plantation Village features 32 authentic and exact replica structures. Thanks to donations from local families, most of them have been furnished with real artifacts, which have been placed in their original settings. The primary beneficiaries of the Village have been local Hawaiian youth, who come here for the educational experiences the Village offers. They number more than 15,000 a year and are joined by about 9,000 other locals and tourists, who come to hear kama'aina (local) guides retell the plantation story'' of hardships and sacrifice in vivid detail. Guided tours are offered every hour between 10am and 2pm, Monday through Saturday. Groups of more than five or individuals wanting foreign-language tours should call for reservations in advance. Special school tours are available, which incorporate hands-on activities. General admission is $13 for adults, $10 for seniors, $7 for local residents and military personnel, and $5 for youth aged 4~11. Children aged 3 and under are admitted free. There is a gift shop for those who would like to bring back souvenirs of their visit. It sells CDs, books, postcards, maps, posters, T-shirts and other items. Friends of the Waipahu Cultural Garden Park receive a 10 percent discount on all purchases. The Village is located at 94-695 Waipahu Street in Waipahu. It can be reached from Honolulu/Waikiki by public transportation: Express Bus A or E from Ala Moana Center, or local bus #43, which departs every 30 minutes. By car, take the H1 to Exit #7, turn left onto Paiwa Street, and then right onto Waipahu Street. The entrance to the Village is on the left."
"Pohaku-ho'ohanau and Pohaku Piko","Hawaii","Pohaku-ho'ohanau and Pohaku Piko","Pohaku Ho'ohanau or Royal Birthstones is a heritage site on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The site is an ancient and sacred location where several of the old Kauai Kings were born. Ther is a stone where a pregnant woman would lean her back and another where she would put her legs in order to give birth. A grass shack once stood in between the stone enclosure, where the mother to be would wait before giving birth.  The flat stone at the front was covered by a sacrificed dog before the birth in order to tell commoners the kapu was forbidden. After the birth the umbilical cord would be placed on the rock wall in a crack. If the cord was stolen by a rat it was a bad sign. A cemetery is also near the site. There are stairs which lead down to it from the stone birthplace. The cemetery dates to about 1890. The site is also known as Pohaku Piko. A plaque stands on site with the secondary name. Pohaku means stone. The site is located next to Holoholoku Heiau, which is a royal place as well. Visitors who wish to see this area need to go to Wailua River State Park."
"Poipu Bay Golf Course","Hawaii","Poipu Bay Golf Course","Poipu Bay Golf Course was designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. to encompass nature and golfing in one. The course is unique, with the emerald mountains as the backdrop to the rolling plateau. The course is eight stories above sea level, with the Pacific Ocean at the course's front door.

"Poipu Bay Resort Golf Course, Koloa, Kauai, Hawaii - Home of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf","Hawaii","Poipu Bay Resort Golf Course, Koloa, Kauai, Hawaii - Home of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf","Even among other nearby Hawaii golf courses, the 18-hole Poipu Bay Golf Course is unlike any other. The course was designed by the renowned Robert Trent Jones, Jr., and was sculpted beneath the lush backdrop of emerald mountains and atop a rolling plateau eight stories above the Pacific Ocean. Here, golfers might encounter the remains of Hawaiian heiau (places of worship), ancient stone walls, as well as nene geese and other native wildlife. Befitting such a course, from 1994-2006, the 210-acre, links-style Poipu Bay Golf Course hosted one of the most prestigious and exclusive competitions in the golfing world: the PGA Grand Slam of Golf. Established in 1979, the event has the most difficult entry requirements of any event in golf. It invites only the winners of the four major championships - the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open, and the PGA Championship - to compete in the event. This par-72 course plays to 7,123 yards from the longest tees. One of its most noteworthy holes is the par-3 No. 7. Even though it's the shortest par-3 on the course at 209 yards, the hole can be one of the most difficult. Bunkers guard the front, the left and the back of the green, while a large pond looms to the right and cups the green. Hole No. 9 is the number-one handicap on the course. This 420-yard hole is daunting for a number of reasons, including the trade winds that typically blow in the face of golfers, the large bunkers that guard both sides of the fairways, and a fairway that narrows to a meager 24 yards at one point. The approach shot is also difficult, playing uphill and into the wind to a green that narrows even more than it looks, with both the front and left side sloping off to chipping areas. Hole No. 16 is considered the signature hole due to its combination of beauty and challenge. Dubbed the Pebble Beach of the Pacific'' by course designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr., the 16th sprawls along the rugged coastline. At 501 yards, the hole is the longest par-4 on the course and one of the longest in the state. Golfers hit from an elevated tee, lessening the hole's length somewhat, but there are many challenges along the way. A small lake is in play and there are two fairway bunkers guarding the right side of the fairway. A sheer cliff face and a steep drop to the ocean guards the left side of the fairway. As this hole doglegs to the left, it follows an ancient rock wall and heiau found on the course. Poipu Bay is also one of the most highly acclaimed resort courses in the Pacific. Golf Magazine gave it a Gold Medal Award'' as one of the Top 18 in the Nation.'' And Golf Digest ranks Poipu Bay as one of the Top 10 Courses in Hawaii.'' The course features a full practice facility, and the Golf Shop at Poipu Bay is considered one of the finest in America. The course also sports a 21,000-square-foot clubhouse, with restaurant, lounge, and locker room facilities. The restaurant, the Poipu Bay Grill & Bar, features an open-air courtyard with stunning views of the 18th hole and the mountains beyond. In addition to golf, the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort is regarded as one of the top resorts in the world. It features 50 acres of ocean front property, and its architecture is reminiscent of Hawaii during the 1920s and `30s, creating a classic connection with the island and its heritage."
"Poipu Coast Trail","Hawaii","Poipu Coast Trail","Poipu Coast Trail or Maha'ulepu Heritage Trail is located in Kauai, Hawaii. It runs along the southern coastline of Kauai from Kenoneloa Bay to Kawailoa Bay. The trail is one of the more interesting because it runs along the geological and cultural sites of the area. The trip begins at Keoneloa Bay which has sand full of calcium carbonate from coralline algae, clams, coral, and other marine organisms. These same organisms still live on the sandy beach and in the waters. Up the ridge of the bay there are sandy dunes of lithified sand. The bay was known for its shipwrecks thus it is also called Shipwreck Cove.  Next on the trail are Makahuena and Makawehi. Makahuena is the southernmost tip of the island, where Makawehi forms from sand dunes. Makawehi is said to be 125,000 years old, having formed from the ice age and wind carrying sand and sea to the shores. Paa Dunes formed about 8,000 years ago atop Makawehi. Here visitors can see red fossil soil, which was also created from lava. There are about 19 points on the trail that one may find interesting. Another is the Pinnacles which are rain water limestone-sandstone creations along the trail."
"Polihale State Park","Hawaii","Polihale State Park","Polihale State Park is located near Waimea on the island of Kauai in Hawaii and is approximately one hour's drive from Kauai Island Airport. Kauai is the fourth largest of the Hawaiian main islands and is also the oldest. Polihale State Park is a remote beach located on the west of the island and is best accessed via 4-wheel drive vehicles as the condition of the road is very poor.  The beach is about three miles long but is mostly unsuitable for swimmers, surfers and snorkelers as the currents are very strong. Whilst most of the beach is exposed, there is one part that is safe for swimming. Queen's Pond is a small encircled reef area located on the south part of the beach that is protected from the winds and therefore a good place to swim. The long sandy stretch of beach is popular for sunbathing and hiking, although visitors are advised to beware of the hot summer sun as there are no places to find shade. There are no medical facilities, lifeguard or anywhere to buy food and drink at the park so visitors are advised to bring provisions with them. However, there is running cold water here as well as toilets, showers and a few pavilions."

Lanai is the oldest of the Hawaiian Islands but is also the smallest inhabited one and people often refer to it as Pineapple Island. Polihua means egg nest and the beach is so called because many turtles came here to bury their eggs in the sand.  The one and a half mile Polihua Beach is the longest white sandy beach on the island. Whilst it is very scenic, the beach is also very exposed to the winds and visitors can encounter sand storms quite frequently. The wind also makes this a very unsuitable area for swimming as the currents can be very strong and subsequently dangerous. However, on windless days this is a great spot for hiking, sunbathing and enjoying a picnic lunch. From Polihua Beach visitors can get great views of the neighboring island, Molokai as well as whales between December and April. This is a very secluded beach that is not so easy to access, which means it is perfect for those looking for privacy and a relaxing day in the sun. It is quite popular with fisherman also."

"Pololu Valley Lookout","Hawaii","Pololu Valley Lookout - Halaula, Big Island, Hawaii - Scenic Vista on the North Kohala Coast","If you drive to the very end of State Route 270 through North Kohala, you will arrive at one of the most scenic vistas on the entire Big Island - Pololu Valley Lookout. This inaccessible region is picturesque on par with Waipi'o Valley, pristine in nature and unspoiled by development. The reason this part of the island was never developed is not for lack of desire. The valley region was once densely populated, but fear of tsunamis forced settlers to move to less vulnerable ground. There have also been signs of earthquake activity, causing the footpaths to be closed from time to time. As long as nature rules the coast here, communities cannot survive. Those who love nature will not mind at all the unimpeded views of the rocky Pololu Valley shoreline from the lookout. For those who want to get closer, there is a trail that zigzags steeply down the heavily vegetated cliff face, rebuilt several times and still dangerous enough to warrant caution if you choose to descend. Stretching out 400 feet below is Pololu Valley Beach. Its black sand is characteristic of the volcanic shoreline of North Kohala. A stream runs down the valley to the sea here, meandering along the side of the dirt path. During rainy periods, waterfalls may appear. It can take about 25 minutes to reach the bottom of the valley from the lookout and even longer on the return, so it is a good idea to pack a lunch to enjoy on the beach. If you follow the trail down through Pololu Valley and cross it to the other side of the stream, the terrain changes to tall trees and dense vegetation in numerous swampy areas. The trail winds up the side of the saddle and into the next valley, the Honokane Nui. From there, you can continue on to still another valley, the Honokane Iki, and more spectacular views of ridges coastal formations further on. Many visitors prefer to remain atop the lookout, just enjoying the view. But the view back up from the beach to the lookout is also quite stunning and well worthy the effort. Be advised that current and waves making swimming and snorkeling offshore dangerous. And don't stray too far from the trails. Two or three hiking or hunting groups a month need to be evacuated by helicopter from this region, which has been said to eat people.'' Visitors should also be aware that the land beyond Pololu Valley is privately owned. An access permit from the Surety Kohala Company is required in order to access these areas legally. The company's office is located next to the Hawi Post Office and Grocery Store, which you will pass on Highway 270 en route to the lookout. There are several other ways to enjoy the panorama of the Pololu Valley. One is to join the Pololu Valley Kohala Wai Adventure, which utilizes a rugged all-terrain Pinzgauer vehicle. Another is offered by Big Island Helicopter Tours, which flies groups into the otherwise inaccessible areas. Visits by charter boat are also possible. Pololu Valley Lookout and Beach have no facilities and no lifeguards. There is limited roadside parking available where Route 270 reaches its dead end at mile marker #28."

The course features spectacular views from 300 feet, overlooking Hanalei Bay and the Pacific Ocean, as well as panoramic views of lush mountains and tropical valleys. The design by famed golf-course architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr. did the rest, taking the naturally rolling terrain and transforming it into a challenging links-style layout. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,309 yards at its longest, with a USGA course rating of 75.2 and slope rating of 140. Acclaimed as one of the most spectacular golf courses in the world, the Prince Golf Course is situated on Kauai's north shore and features climbing slopes and careening hills, making for a demanding round and calling for a player's best shot-making skills. A prime example includes the par-4 12th hole. The teeing area is a cliff 10 stories tall, and golfers must hit a straight tee shot to end up safely in a narrow fairway 100 feet below. Be off by the narrowest of margins, and a dense jungle will claim another wayward shot. The Prince Course's signature hole, the par-3 7th is another example, as an approach shot has golfers hitting to a tiny, elevated green perched on a narrow island. A deep gorge surrounds the green on two sides, while the ocean beckons on the third. To assist golfers, all carts are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) monitors to provide exact yardage to fairway hazards, the center of greens and pin placement, as well as a bird's-eye view of each hole. The course, which is named after a young, 19th-century prince, Prince Albert, the son of Hawaii's King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world.

"Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Lava-Carved Images of Ancient Hawaiian Life","Among the many archeological attractions at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park are the ancient images near the southern flank of Kilauea volcano known as the Pu'u Loa Petroglyphs. These include thousands of drawings etched into the hardened lava, some showing human representations known as anthropomorphs. In the Hawaiian language, Pu'u Loa means long hill.'' It refers to a place considered sacred to the people of Kalapana. At this site, carbon dating has indicated that the locality was inhabited in the early 15th century, and the native Hawaiians left plenty of evidence of how they lived more than five centuries ago. Pecked into the volcanic rock are more than 23,000 petroglyph images. Of the total, some 84 percent are cupules or holes. Other images include circles and other geometric motifs, cryptic designs, canoe sails, and even feathered caps, in addition to the aforementioned anthropomorphs representing families, traditions and beliefs. Also found in the area are remnants of house platforms and caves used as dwellings. Enclosures have been discovered, which may have been used to hold livestock. There are excavated pits and rock mulch mounds, too, that might suggest animal husbandry and farming took place here. The Pu'u Loa Petroglyph Field was first observed by Reverend William Ellis, a missionary to the Hawaiian and Society Islands. He recorded seeing the petroglyphs at Pu'u Loa in 1823, describing them as straight lines, semicircles, or concentric rings, with some rude imitations of the human figure, cut or carved in the compact rocks of lava.'' Ellis believed the etchings were left by visitors to the area. A number of concentric circles with a dot or mark in the center indicated the party who had circumambulated the island. In 1914, however, anthropologist Martha Beckwith visited Pu'u Loa and interpreted these markings as family symbols. She said that they show how many members there were in a family and what their ranks were in the tribe. Today, experts still debate the meaning. In the past, it was a common practice to take rubbings of the petroglyphs to create a copy or duplicate. It was found, however, that any abrasion or scuffing of the images damages them and speeds the erosion process, so rubbings are no longer allowed. Instead, a boardwalk has been constructed above the ground surface to elevate the pathway and allow visitors to walk by and view a section of the extensive area and the variety of petroglyphs at the site from a safe distance. Pu'u Loa is accessible from the parking area pullout where an emergency call box is located on Chain of Craters Road at mile marker 16.5. It is a 0.7-mile walk from the pullout to the boardwalk, traversing a gently undulating pahoehoe lava bedrock trail. Visitors to the park will want to stop by the Kilauea Visitor Center before traveling on to the petroglyph field. The Center is located at Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96785. The park is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and the Visitor Center's operating hours are from 7:45am to 5pm daily. Rangers at the Center can provide the latest information on hiking, group activities, road conditions, and safety precautions."
"Pu'ukohola Heiau","Hawaii","Pu'ukohola Heiau - Kawaihae, Big Island, Hawaii - King's Last Temple and Historic Site","The Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site is among the most revered and treasured locations on the Big Island of Hawaii. Here, the last magnificent temple of Kamehameha the Great was constructed in 1791 above the blue waters of the Pacific. It was originally created as a temple of war, which the king believed would give him the spiritual power (mana) to unite all of the islands of Hawaii as one - a vision which came true in 1810, ending more than a thousand years of internal warfare. According to legend, Pu'ukohola Heiau came into existence as the result of prophesy. A Kahuna (priest) named Kapoukahi told the king that if he would be able to conquer all of the islands if he built a heiau (temple) on the hill known as Pu'ukohola and dedicate it to the family's war god, Kuka'ilimoku. It took thousands of workers more than a year to It is said that thousands and thousands of men labored for nearly a year to raise the mighty structure. Many of its stones are believed to have come from the Pololu Valley. The laborers formed a human chain almost 25 miles long to pass the water-worn lava stones person-by-person all the way to the construction site. No mortar, cement or other bonding materials were used. The rocks were positioned in exactly to meet the heiau's building specifications. Apart from King Kamehameha, the Pu'ukohola Heiau has been associated with other famous figures in Hawaii's past. John Young, a stranded British sailor, became and advisor to the king and handled his business affairs with foreign traders. For his work, Young was granted land at Kawaihae for a home. Later, the granddaughter of John Young became Queen Emma. She was actually born on the temple site. Subsequent to Hawaiian unification, the Pu'ukohola Heiau was mounted with cannons and turned into a fortress. Over the years, earthquakes and other natural disasters have destroyed many of the original structures. The remains of the building dedicated to sharks gods known as Hale o Kapuni Heiau, for example, now lie submerged in the waters of the Pacific offshore. Earthquakes in 2006 damaged several structures, too, and repairs have bee ongoing. The Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site is open every day from 7:45am to 5pm throughout the year, including national holidays. Admission is free, although educational programs must be scheduled in advance and there is a $2 per person charge for non-educational guided tours for groups of 10 or more. Please note that the park entrance gate closes at 4:30pm daily. The Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site is located at 62-3601 Kawaihae Road, Kawaihae, Hawaii 96743-9720. From Keahole-Kona International Airport, take State Highway 19 north for 27 miles, and then turn north onto Highway 270, also known as Kawaihae Road. Follow this road a half mile to the park entrance on the left. The Visitor Center is down the hill towards Spencer Beach County Park. Special note : The year 2010 marks the 200th anniversary of Hawaiian unification. Given its important role in the history of the islands, the Pu'ukohola Heiau National Historic Site is celebrating this occasion with special ceremonies, culminating on August 14~15 and recognizing Ho'oku'ikahi Establishment Day. A Hawaiian Cultural Festival is being held, with special Talk Story'' programs, park ranger programs, living history events, cultural demonstrations, educational classes and more."

"Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve","Hawaii","Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve","Puako Petroglyph Archaeological Preserve is located along the Kohala Coast on the north west of the Island of Hawaii. The petroglyphs are also known as kii pohaku and are lava rock carvings etched into stone several centuries ago by Native Hawaiians. The true meanings of these carvings are unknown although many think they represent special events such as births.  This preserve has over 3,000 petroglyphs and includes carvings of human forms, canoes, dogs, birds and turtles amongst other things. It is one of the most extensive petroglyph fields not only on the Big Island, but the whole of Hawaii. A trail takes visitors through the preserve over a lava field and through an iron wood forest, which can be rocky in places and will require a strong pair of shoes. The trail is marked with a sign and an interpretive kiosk. The petroglyphs are a short walk from Fairmont Orchid Hawaii and the Mauna Lani Resort. The Mauna Lani Hotel has maps and a brochure of the petroglyphs here and offers guided tours with a local historian. Visitors are politely requested not to touch the petroglyphs or take rubbings of them as it could seriously damage these fragile stone carvings."
"Punaluu Beach Park","Hawaii","Punaluu Beach Park - Naalehu, Big Island, Hawaii - Black Sand Beach and Sea Turtles","Just twenty minutes from Hawaii Volcanoes National Park en route from Kailua-Kona, the Punaluu Beach Park is famous for its black sands and giant sea turtles. The park was once the site of a Hawaiian village, too, but a tsunami destroyed it. Much of the coastline subsequently slipped beneath the ocean, and remains of the old community can still be found under the Pacific waters. In Hawaiian language, the word punaluu means a diving (lu'u) spring (puna). In the past, divers would go to the very bottom of the bay here and fill upside-down containers with fresh spring water that seeps up from the sea floor. At one time the bay had a dock that was used for loading sugar cane onto merchant ships. However, the U.S. military destroyed the structure during WWII so that it would not fall into enemy hands. Past the park's boat ramp, the old dock's cement remains can still be seen. The railroad once ran by here, too, on tracks raised 10 to 15 feet above the ground. Although the rails are gone, the narrow road that supported the tracks is still in use today, serving as a boat launch and a gathering point for local picnickers. It almost goes without saying that swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving are the biggest attractions at Punaluu Beach Park. However, because the offshore currents can be quite strong, it is recommended that swimmers and divers stay close to shore and obey all posted warming signs. No lifeguards are on duty. Less challenging swims can be found at the white sand beach of Punaluu Bay, adjacent to the park and safe from the rip tides. Fishing from the shores of Punaluu Beach Park is also popular with locals. Care must be taken, however, not to disturb the giant turtles that swim just offshore and often crawl up on the beach. The Green Sea Turtle and the Hawksbill Turtle are endangered species and strictly protected by state and federal laws. Day trippers will appreciate the park's pavilion with its drinking water and electrical outlets, which can be used for various functions. There is also a designated picnic area near the beach, and both restrooms and showers are available on site. Tall palm trees provide plenty of shade, and there are grassy areas for relief from the coarse black sand, which can get quite hot in the daytime sun. One other attraction here is a fresh water pond, where a variety of exotic ducks make their home. Wading is possible in the salt-free water. Camping is also allowed, though the entire area is open to the wind, which can be quite gusty. The entry road for Punaluu Beach Park is just off State Highway 11, between mile markers #55 and #56. It is midway between the small towns of Naalehu and Pahala. The nearest information station is the Punaluu Bake Shop and Visitor Center, located in Naalehu on a four-acre tropical estate off Highway 11. Visitors are encouraged to pick up free samples of the local Hawaiian sweetbread, along with sandwiches, plate lunches, fresh salads and other picnic items to take to the beach."
"Puohokamoa Falls","Hawaii","Puohokamoa Falls","Puohokamoa Falls are located off of Hana Highway in Maui, Hawaii. The waterfall is actually made up of an upper and lower falls. The lower falls are small with only a 20 foot drop where the water heads into a deep and slippery pool. The state has created a picnic area near the falls for hikers and travelers to enjoy the falls. The middle falls is also on the stream, which is a few moments from the pool and lower falls. The upper falls tends to be less crowded because it is a small hike up. Walking ten minutes from the lower and middle falls to the real Lower Puohokamoa Falls leads one to the 200 foot cliff. It can be seen better at the upper falls and the Puohokamoa Falls Lookout.  The rocks on the stream are going to be slippery due to algae so visitors need to be cautious. Also use caution when walking around the edge of Lower Puohokamoa Falls. It is better to get close with the lookout rather than walking on the walks directly near the falls. Travel on Hana Highway to mile marker #11 close to a bridge. The bridge is the main feature near the small parking area helping guests realize where to park. There is a short path to the picnic area and the two smaller falls on the stream."
"Puu Kukui","Hawaii","Puu Kukui","Pu'u Kukui is a mountain peak in Maui, Hawaii. It is the highest peak as part of Mauna Kahalawai. Mauna Kahalawai is part of the West Maui Mountains. The mountain is 5,787 feet to the summit rising above the Pu'u Kukui Watershed Management Area. The area is 8,661 acres. The state considers it a nature preserve with only private access allowed. It is maintained by the Maui Land and Pineapple Company. Pu'u Kukui was formed by a volcano, but the caldera eroded making I'ao Valley.  Pu'u Kukui is considered as one of the wettest locations on Earth, with Mount Wai'ale'ale being the second in terms of rainfall each year. About 386.5 inches of rain drops on the mountain top. The rainwater then flows into a bog, allowing for dense, acidic, and deep soil. Pu'u Kukui provides a location and home for many native plants, birds, and insects such as greensword. Several of the species of plants remain in dwarf size because of the peat soils. It is one of the reasons the land area is considered restricted for conservationists and researchers. There is one hiking trail that a visitor can take up the side of the mountain and one must remain on the trail at all times."
"Puu Ualakaa State Park","Hawaii","Puu Ualakaa State Park - Honolulu, Hawaii - Panoramic Views & Stunning Sunsets","There are hundreds of places in Honolulu offering panoramic views of the city and sea, but the wayside lookout in Puu Ualakaa State Park is considered among the best. From a height of 1,048 feet, the views of Diamond Head, Waikiki, and downtown Honolulu are majestic. And on clear days, which means just about every day, it is possible to see all the way past Pearl Harbor and the airport to the Waianae Range across the entire length of Oahu Island. The viewing platform at the Puu Ualakaa State Wayside has a concrete base, with a surrounding steel railing and a substantial roof that provides shelter from the gusty breezes and shade from the tropical sun. Temperatures here tend to be ten degrees cooler than they are by the shore below. A paved walkway makes access easy, even by wheelchair, and a grassy area below the platform is a favorite location for photography. Two especially good times to come here for sightseeing are dawn and dusk. When the clouds are right, the early morning and evening skies paint the perfect backdrop for paradise.'' Admission to the wayside is free. Open hours are 7am to 6:45pm throughout the year, with extended access to till 7:45pm from Labor Day through March 31. Because the wayside closes early, spectacular night views of the city lights and stars over the Pacific cannot be seen from this point, but they can be enjoyed by parking higher up along winding, single-lane Mount Tantalus Road. The peak of Mt. Tantalus is nearly 2,000-feet above sea level. As one might imagine, the unlit road turns into a romantic hangout for young lovers after dark. But it also becomes a preying ground for thieves, so visitors are advised to keep their cars locked and within sight while taking in the scenery. In Hawaiian language, the name of the state park refers to a crop that was once grown here. Pu'u Ualaka'a'' literally means rolling sweet potato hill.'' In early times, planters would use gravity to help bring in the harvest, allowing the tubers they dug up to roll down the slopes to packers below. Apart from the lookout, the park offers several hiking paths. The most popular route is the Ualakaa Trail - a good family trail.'' There is a trailhead sign on the approach to the wayside. The trail itself begins a short walk back down the road from the parking area. The trail takes a mile-long loop through a thick wooded canopy. The terrain is rated as forested cinder cone,'' and the difficulty is easy. A steadily rising walk with a 400-foot gain brings hikers to a four-way intersection at the uphill end of the trail, 0.53 miles from the start. A system trail map can be found here, showing the paths that lead further away: the Makiki Valley, Moleka, and Maunalaha trails. Mountain biking is not allowed on the trails. Dogs must be kept on leashes. Although no hiking permit is required, camping and open fires are not allowed. Services available at Puu Ualakaa State Park include free parking, restrooms, picnic shelters, trash cans and drinking water, in addition to the scenic lookout and well-marked trails. The park is located at the end of Round Hill Drive, about five miles (10 minutes) from Waikiki through the Rain Forest Reserve by car."
"Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park","Hawaii","Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park - Honaunau, Big Island, Hawaii - A Place of Refuge and Preservation","Established in 1955, this park was originally named the City of Refuge Park. Its location was one of several puuhonua, or places of refuge,'' located throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Such sites were considered sacred. Anyone who had broken the law could seek out the sanctuary of a puuhonua to avoid arrest and punishment. They provided safe haven, even for those who had been sentenced to death. In 1978, the park was renamed the Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park. Local artisans were commissioned to restore the environs to its 18th century look. Today, the park covers 420 acres and includes a number of other archeological attractions in addition to the puuhonua. A centerpiece of the Puuhonua O Honaunau National Historical Park is the Hale o Keawe, a temple constructed in honor of Keawe'ikekahiali'i o kamoku, the great-grandfather of Kamehameha I. The temple is surrounded by carved wooden images known as ki'i. Over time, the bones of 23 village chieftains were housed here, and the sanctity of the mausoleum was respected by all for its mana, or special spiritual power. A number of thatched structures have been reconstructed near the temple. These include a library where an extensive collection of books and videos have been deposited to enable guests to learn more about the natural and cultural history of the island of Hawaii. There are also numerous oral histories left by descendants from the surrounding area. The library is open to the public, although appointments should be made to view certain rare items. Near the temple, a mock village has been constructed. Called Ki'ilae, this tiny coastal hamlet gives visitors a glimpse into Hawaii's past and the many changes that followed the arrival of Europeans. On display are canoes made of local koa wood with lashings of coconut fiber, along with other artifacts representing life here more than two centuries ago. It is possible to access the beach from the park at Keone'ele Cove. This area was once off limits to all but ali'i (chiefs). Given the cultural and religious importance of the area, however, along with the presence of threatened Hawaiian Green Sea Turtles, snorkeling is discouraged within the park. A great wall marks the boundaries between the puuhonua and the royal grounds. Other attractions include a petroglyph carved into the lava rock and the placid waters of the royal fishpond. More than 180 species of plants can be also seen along the park's trails and coast. Many, such as noni, are medicinal. Others were used for food or clothing. Brochures and maps are available at the Visitors Center and can be used for a self-guided tour. It takes roughly one or two hours to appreciate all the park has to offer. Although there is no food for sale here, it may be brought in and consumed in the recreation area at the back of the park. There are picnic tables and barbecue facilities, plus a great view of the ocean and sunset. The park gates are open until 8pm daily. The weather is usually hot and sunny, with daytime highs in the upper 80s and night time lows in the 70s. To reach the park from Kailua-Kona, travel along State Highway 11 south 20 miles. At the Honaunau Post Office, between mile markers #103 and #104, turn right towards the ocean onto State Highway 160.

"Queen Emma Summer Palace","Hawaii","Queen Emma Summer Palace - Honolulu, Hawaii - Royal Retreat Turned Museum","Queen Emma was the wife of King Kamehameha IV. She used travel with her family to the historic Nu'uanu Valley in the mid-1800s as an escape from the demands of court life in hot, dusty Honolulu. Here, in this lush, cool valley, the King and Queen, together with their young son, Prince Albert Edward, had some of their happiest times together. Their summer palace'' has quite a history. It was actually a Victorian-style house built in 1848 by John Lewis, a part-Hawaiian businessman, who had bought the property from the Hawaiian Government. The house frame and siding were allegedly cut in Boston and shipped via Cape Horn to Oahu. Two years later, Lewis sold the estate for $6,000 to Queen Emma's uncle, John Young II. When the uncle died childless in 1857, he willed the property to his niece, making Queen Emma the official owner. Then, when she passed away in 1885, the home was purchased by the Hawaiian Monarchy and leased out to tenants. But in the early 1900s, when plans were drawn up to turn the estate into a park, the Daughters of Hawaii stepped in and claimed the house for restoration as a museum. Established in 1903, the Daughters of Hawaii was founded by seven daughters of American Protestant missionaries. They were born in the Islands as citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom before annexation. When they foresaw the potential loss of Hawaiian culture, they banded together to perpetuate the memory and spirit of old Hawaii and of historic facts.'' The Palace was subsequently refurbished and many of the original furnishings were returned to their home. Today, the museum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Inside, it houses a collection of Queen Emma's personal belongings, including 19th-century furnishings, artifacts and memorabilia. The estate also goes by the name Hanaiakamalama,'' which means foster child of the moon,'' a reference to royalty's ancestral home on the Island of Hawaii. Membership dues, admission fees, fundraising activities, grants, and donations to the Daughters of Hawaii are used for upkeep. Admission to the Palace is $6 for adults, $1 for children, and $4 for kamaaina (local residents). Admission is free to current members of the Daughters of Hawaii (i.e., Daughters and Calabash Cousins). The Queen Emma Summer Palace is open from 8am to 4pm seven days a week, except major holidays. Its Emmalani Hale and Prince Albert Terrace are both available for rental as well as for visits, and the museum has become a popular venue for weddings, business meetings, and other events, with a capacity of up to 100 participants. One other feature here is a gift shop located directly behind the Summer Palace. It offers hand-crafted items, most of which have been made exclusively for the shop. Also for sale are books on Hawaii, and there are unique cards and gifts particularly well suited to weddings. The Queen Emma Summer Palace is located at 2913 Pali Highway, Honolulu, HI 96817, easily reached by car or bus from downtown Honolulu and Waikiki. Plenty of free parking space is available."

"Queen Kapiolani Park","Hawaii","Queen Kapiolani Park - Honolulu, Hawaii - Top Park for Picnics, Concerts & Sports","Created in the 1870's by King David Kalakaua and named after his wife, this expansive park appears on the State's Historic Register. Many of the trees here are more than 100 years old and the park has played a pivotal role in community development just as long. The park is located toward the east end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Crater. It takes the form of a huge triangle bordered by Kalakaua, Monsarrat, and Paki avenues, adjacent to the 42-acre Honolulu Zoo. Originally, this was a marshland marked by lagoons, tiny islands and small fish ponds. Through a land grant issued in 1876, the monarch made an initial 108 acres available to the Kapiolani Park Association,'' and the area was formally named Queen Kapiolani Park'' the following year. Landscaping was undertaken by Archibald Cleghorn, father of Princess Kaiulani, and in its early days the park contained a racetrack, then later a polo field. Hard work and planning over more than a century transformed the park into the true community recreation facility that it is today. Now managed by the State of Hawaii's Department of Parks and Recreation, it is sometimes referred to less formally as Kapiolani Park, although the royal title still applies. Amenities here include comfort stations, showers and free public parking areas. For sporting enthusiasts, there are three softball fields, a rugby ground, five soccer fields, the Elks Club baseball park, children's playgrounds and an archery range, plus a popular three-mile jogging course. Also available are tennis, basketball and volleyball courts. Local families and tourists alike enjoy the 28 shady picnic sites and grassy meeting areas, which can accommodate gatherings of up to 500 people. A hibiscus garden and flower nursery are maintained on the park's inland perimeter, while a bougainvillea arbor and sitting area provides respite across Kalakaua Avenue by the shore. This is also where visitors can find the local Natatorium and Waikiki Aquarium, just past the Queen Surf beach area. Queen Kapiolani Park is the home of Waikiki Shell, an amphitheater where outdoor musical events and shows are frequently staged, including the renowned Kodak Hula Show. Every Sunday afternoon, the Royal Hawaiian Band performs free concerts in the smaller Kapiolani Bandstand, even as local artists set up their works for the park's weekly open-air sale. Each Wednesday between 10 am and 11 am, the Queen Kapiolani Park People's Open Market (POM) takes place in the tree-lined parking lot adjacent to Waikiki Shell. This market has been going strong since 1973, providing the opportunity to purchase fresh agricultural and marine products and other food items at low cost. It supports the livelihood of local farmers and fishermen, while giving residents an opportunity to socialize. The POM entrance is on Monsarrat Street. A famous annual event associated with the park is the Honolulu Marathon. On Marathon Sunday, a carnival-like extravaganza erupts here near the finish line, with multicolored tents, flags, and visitors from all over the world. The park serves as the base of operations for more than 27,000 runners and plays host to some 48,000 volunteers and spectators. Among other annual events, the Na Hula Festival is held in the park each August. Since 1941, this weekend-long festival has celebrated the artistry and grace of Hawaii's native dance, the hula. It is a non-competitive event, featuring food and craft vendors as well as a program of performances by local dance troupes at the Kapiolani Bandstand throughout the day. There is no charge for admission."
"Queen's Bath","Hawaii","Queen's Bath","Queen's Bath is a unique swimming area on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The area is a pool which was carved into a lava shelf. It is larger than many swimming pools put together. Unfortunately, the pool is closed during the winter months since the natural conditions of the pool can lead to injury. In summer months, the surf is slow meaning the water is crystal clear and calm.  The surf can pound during the winter months, which is what often leads to injury. There is a freshwater stream nearby the saltwater pool where visitors can rinse themselves. Views of the ocean can be found from the rocky shoreline. Small fish even live in Queen's Bath. To arrive at the site one must take Highway 56 to Princeville before turning right onto Ka Haku Road. From there, take a right turn on Punahele with a right on Kapiolani Park. At the end of the road there is a dirt trail which takes visitors to the stream 25 yards away. At the end of the trail there is a left turn that takes one 300 yards to the bath.

"Rainbow Falls","Hawaii","Rainbow Falls - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Rainbow Forming Waterfall near Hilo","Easily accessed near the northern outskirts of Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii, Rainbow Falls is a beautifully dynamic waterfall on the Wailuku River. The falls get their name from the colorful rainbows that can often be seen in the mist that rises from the circular collecting pool 80 feet below. The area that contains the falls is often referred to as Rainbow Falls State Park, although it is technically part of Wailuku River State Park, which starts a couple of miles upstream from here. The Hawaiian name for the waterfall is Waianuenue, which quite literally means rainbow seen in water.'' Wailuku River State Park consists of 16.3 acres of protected land along the 18-mile-long Wailuku River, which is the longest river in Hawaii. Its name means waters of destruction,'' and after a heavy rainfall, its current can indeed be a raging flood. At such times the rushing torrent that streams over Rainbow Falls looks like a muddy version of Niagara. Most of the time, however, the water pouring from the lip of Rainbow Falls is a steady flow and exceedingly clean. One of the best times for catching a glimpse of the rainbow effect is early morning, and especially just after dawn, when the rays of the sun are angled just perfectly for refracting through the filtering mist. Another good time for viewing is when the sun comes out immediately after a good rain. That's when the volume of water increases and so does the amount of mist it creates. Directly behind the waterfall is a huge natural cave, carved into the rocky cliff by centuries of powerful splash back. According to ancient legends, this was the home of Hina, mother of the demigod Maui. The roar of the falling water could well be her throaty singing. The vegetation around the basin of the falls is lush and typical of the local rainforest. It includes mango trees covered with philodendron, African tulip trees, kukui (candlenut - the Hawaiian state tree), banana trees and a variety of tropical flowers. There is no access to the river, the falls or the collecting pool from the park entrance, so visitors should not plan on swimming here. The only facilities are the scenic lookout with its protective railing, the paved parking lot, and simple restrooms. While in the area, visitors are well advised to follow Waianuenue Avenue upstream to the end of Pe'epe'e Falls Drive. That's where the Wailuku River's current forms a number of cascading pools that roll and swirl after upslope rains - a region known as the Boiling Pots. From the overlook there, Pe'epe'e Falls can be seen, too. Rainbow Falls are located at Rainbow Drive, Hilo 96720. To get there from town, just drive up Waianuenue Avenue about two miles and bear to the right on Rainbow Drive. The Rainbow Junction Gift Shop can be seen across the road from the park entrance. The parking lot will be on your right, and the lookout is just 50 feet beyond. Admission is free and the park is open every day of the year from sunrise to sunset."
"Rainbow Falls Tattoo- Kailua-Kona","Hawaii","Rainbow Falls Tattoo- Kailua-Kona, Big Island, Hawaii - The Big Island's Oldest Tattoo Service","The Big Island's oldest tattoo shop is also one of its finest. Founded by ink specialist Steve Cotton, Rainbow Falls Tattoo has not only become a fixture in the Kailua-Kona scene, it has also opened a branch in Hilo and, most recently, another in Sedona, Arizona. Steve's work ranges from simple geometric designs to elaborate portraiture. Many of his portfolio entries are Hawaiian themes, such as sea turtles, geckos, leaping dolphins, and tropical floral motifs. He also excels at Japanese-style irezumi and, of course, Hawaiian arm and leg bands. Hawaiian tattooing is an ancient custom and one of the earliest Polynesian art forms. Originally, Hawaiian tribal tattoo art was known as Kakau'' and applied under strict religious rules. Even today, many Hawaiians recognize tattoo gods and whenever a member of the community gets a tattoo, prayers may be said in a temple. Some tattoos were believed to offer protection from evil spirits or ill fortune. Others were applied as a symbol of mourning for a loved one. And in some cases, tattoos may be selected strictly as adornments. The most common use of Hawaiian tattoos, however, is for personal identification rather than ceremonial purposes. Traditional Hawaiian tribal tattoos are mostly black. The tattoo ink used to make them originally came from a mixture of kukui nuts and sugarcane juice. The tools used to create them came from the sharp and pointy animal parts, such as claws, bird beaks, or fish fins, connected to a piece of wood and struck with a mallet. Hawaiian tattoo designs tend to be larger and bolder than their Polynesian counterparts. Typical motifs include lizards, sea creatures, arrows, and flowers. Hawaiian men usually have tattoos on their legs, arms, face or torso. Women may have them on their hands, wrists or tongue. After Western contact, Hawaiian tattoo art broadened to include more fanciful shapes such as birds, goats, fans, and guns. Upon King Kamehameha's death in 1819, many Hawaiians had his image tattooed on themselves as an indication of respect for the king. The tattoo art of Rainbow Falls Tattoo uses only the latest equipment, of course, and the artists, although mindful of local traditions, are decidedly modern in their approach. Like Steve, Cheryl Cotton has a broad repertoire, which includes dragons, Japanese koi, tropical birds and elegant floral arrangements. Other artists handle butterflies, warriors, tropical fish, flaming phoenix, snakes, and every other kind of design imaginable. Especially popular among women are the hibiscus and orchid designs. Besides body art, Rainbow Falls Tattoo has also offered a spray tanning service since 2003. The color lasts from five to twelve days, takes only 20 minutes to apply, and costs $35 per treatment. Rainbow Falls Tattoo is located at 75-5719 Alii Drive, Kailua-Kona Hawaii 96740-1738. To get there from Kona International Airport, take the Queen Kaahumanu Highway (State Route 19) south to State Highway 11. Continue to Palani Road and turn right.

"Russian Fort Elisabeth","Hawaii","Russian Fort Elisabeth","Russian Fort Elizabeth is located on the Island of Kauai, Hawaii. It is a reminder that the Russians were in Hawaii between 1815 and 1817. The fort was built by the Russian American Company who formed an alliance with High Chief Kaumuali'i. The fort is considered a national historic landmark. It is cared for by the administration of the Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park. The fort is southwest of Waimea.  A German physician by the name of Georg Anton Schaffer was an agent for the Russian American Company. He arrived in 1815. His supplies were seized by the chief, but they soon established a relationship, which is why permission was given to build the fort. Kaumuali'I never intended on giving the land the fort was on up, thus Tsar Alexander never obtained his freedom from Kamehameha's Rule over the island. Armaments were eventually removed from the fort dismantling it as a strong hold. The munitions were sold as scrap metal; however, the large stone walls are still in existence for guests to see. One can take the brochure offered by the park to walk around what is left of the dismantled fort in order to see the glory of what once was."

"S. Hata Building","Hawaii","S. Hata Building - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Landmark Masonry Building in Hilo","Listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1991, the two-story S. Hata Building in downtown Hilo is one of the Big Island's most enduring architectural landmarks. It was originally erected in 1912 by Japanese immigrant Sadanosuke Hata and his family as a general store, but it has survived tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and urban renewal to become a testament to Hawaii's pioneering past. Hata himself started out as an agent for a Honolulu store called Odo Shoten. He was responsible for taking orders along the Hamakua coast, which inspired him to start his own business in Hilo around 1896. His store sold products imported from Asia, notably silks, kimonos, and oriental souvenirs along with Japanese provisions. As business grew, he required a larger venue. Thus, the S. Hata Building was conceived and built for $25,000 on wetlands facing what was then called Front Street. Although quite a number of masonry commercial buildings similar to this were built in Honolulu in the early 20th century, Hilo's S. Hata Building was unique as a symbol of progress in the outlying island city. When it was constructed in the Oriental section of town, the only other masonry buildings in Hilo were the sugar-funded Hackfeld Building and the Masonic Hall. It therefore stood as a symbol of the upward mobility of this segment of the population. Today, the S. Hata Building measures 109' x 60' and anchors one end of Hilo's primary downtown street, Kamehameha Avenue. It houses shops, restaurants (including the noted Cafy Pesto), offices, and a museum called Mokupapapa: Discovery Center for Hawaii's Remote Coral Reefs. The Center's role is to interpret the natural science, culture, and history of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding marine environment. The S. Hata Building's fazade, which consists of five bays, curves slightly at both ends, defining the original contour of the road. The first floor has always been used for retail activity. Its store fronts feature large plates of glass and inset, double door entries. Although the aluminum windows and doorways were added during World War II, the transoms above them are the original materials, as are the masonry bottom panels. On the second floor are fourteen round arched windows. Each of the end bays has three windows with concrete sills and the three middle bays have eight. Connecting the windows is a drip stone motif created in relief. Inscribed discs have been situated between the arches. Separating the first and second stories is a metal awning. Although its metal roof has been replaced in recent years, the curvilinear wrought iron brackets have survived intact. They are clearly visible from the sidewalk below, giving the building a strong rhythmic element'' at the pedestrian level. In reviewing the S. Hata Building for inclusion on the National Register, examiners noted that it is architecturally significant as a good example of an early twentieth century commercial structure in Hilo.... The building's design is typical of its period and function with regards to its scale, its layout, use of second story round arched windows, and restrained embellishment.'' The building is also significant for its associations with the development of downtown Hilo and the Hata Store.'' The S. Hata Building is located at the intersection of Mamo Street and Kamehameha Avenue in downtown Hilo. The address is 308 Kamehameha Avenue, Hilo, Hawaii 96720-2960."
"Saddle Road","Hawaii","Saddle Road - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Home to Professional Star Gazers","Hawaii State Highway 200, also known as Ala Mauna Saddle Road'' or simply Saddle Road,'' cuts across the heart of the Big Island. It starts in downtown Hilo and terminates south of Waimea at State Highway 190, twisting and turning through some precarious mountain terrain as it passes by the Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes. Along the way, the road reaches a maximum elevation of 6,632 feet. Saddle Road was originally opened as a gravel road during World War II. It provided access to an Army training area located within the Big Island's interior. It was also intended to serve as an inland evacuation route, should Japanese forces have attacked the Big Island. It remained a secondary route until 1949, when the road was paved for the first time. Until 2007, Saddle Road was so poorly maintained, narrow and hazardous that some rental car companies would not allow their vehicles to be taken there. Even the best-kept parts of the old road were posted with speed limits of only 35-45 miles per hour. However, many improvements have been made in the past few years, including the resurfacing of a seven-mile stretch that now allows speeds up to 50 miles per hour. According to the most recent reports from local sources, the route is not nearly the danger (or the fun) that it once was and is becoming a viable alternative to State Highway 19 as a shortcut between Hilo and Kailua-Kona. Specific areas of improvement have been the new alignment between mile markers #28 and #35, which opened in 2007 and the reconstruction of the existing road between mile markers #19 and #28 in 2008. The latest phase is a rerouting of traffic between mile markers #35 and #42 near the Army base. Additional improvements are planned between mile markers #6 and #19, too. And a southern bypass around downtown Hilo has made it easier to access Saddle Road's eastern end. Much of this construction has been paid for by the U.S. Department of Defense, who deemed the realignments necessary to move the route away from the Army base. As the first phase was completed, the phrase Ala Mauna'' was added to the road's name, meaning trail to the mountains.'' There are a number of interesting sites to see along the drive, not the least of which are the lava fields of the Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa volcanoes, which cover the saddle'' between the two. One side road takes visitors to the Onizuka Astronomy Complex and Visitors Information Station on Mauna Kea. Another leads to the weather observatory on the north slope of Mauna Loa. Drivers are advised that sections of Ala Mauna Saddle Road are still quite narrow. Pavement edges can be rough and head-on collisions are still a real problem. Dense fog mixed with volcanic ash, called vog,'' can make visibility poor. Reflectors have not been installed west of mile marker #35, so night driving can be tricky. At one time, the road's accident rate was 80% higher than that of Hawaii's two-lane rural highways on average, but thanks to the improvements, that statistic is now dropping steadily."

"Seven Sacred Pools","Hawaii","Seven Sacred Pools, Hana Maui, HI","Seven Sacred Pools is located on Highway 31 in southeast Maui or Hana, Hawaii. The pools are a series of waterfalls and pools which trail through O'heo Gulch and flow out to the ocean. The Pipiwai Streams are what feed the falls and the seven pools. The pools start two miles inland, but the best of the pools are closer to the shore.  The land that encompasses the Seven Sacred Pools was donated to Haleakala National Park. The donating ensured the pools would remain open for the public, but they would also be protected by the national park. It is now a playground for residents and tourists. Hiking, historical sites, pool swimming, and cliff jumping are a few of the activities one can enjoy on a visit to the pools. The area tends to be crowded on the weekends. The Pipiwai Trail is the best hiking with a 4 mile round trip hike, where 650 feet of elevation is gained. It usually takes 2.5 to 5 hours depending on how fast one hikes. Infinity Pool is one of the best along the trail where thick rocks line up so one cannot fall the 200 feet down to the pool. There are no lifeguards for those who swim."
"Shangri La","Hawaii","Shangri La - Honolulu, Hawaii - House with a Unique Perspective on Islamic Art","During the late 1930s, American heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke built her home on five acres of Honolulu property overlooking Diamond Head and the Pacific Ocean. She named it Shangri La,'' in reference to the idyllic fictional hideaway described by James Hilton in his novel Lost Horizon.'' Upon her death in 1993, the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art (DDFIA) was created to manage the Shangri La estate and promote the study and understanding of Middle Eastern art and culture. The idea was to make the property available to scholars, students and others who are interested in Islamic art, while making the grounds open to the public. Today, Shangri La occupies five acres of waterfront property. The main house has a total floor area of about 14,000 square feet, built around a roofless central patio. The interior includes art, furniture and architectural elements from a number of countries, notably Iran, Morocco, Turkey, Spain, Syria, Egypt and India. Painted ceilings, doors, marble screens, tile panels, ceramics, textiles, carpets and paintings are just some of the furnishings. The Shangri La Playhouse is a scale model of a 17th-century royal pavilion constructed in Iran. It contains a central recreational room and two guest rooms. Between it and the main building is a 75-foot swimming pool, water terraces, and steps of made of white marble. An Indian Mughal garden is also part of the landscape. The extensive Collections of the Shangri La, over 3,500 objects from the Islamic world are housed here, including the original pieces that Duke first began collecting during her honeymoon travels through the Middle East and India in 1935. The Collections represent nearly six decades of sustained custodial efforts. Since 2002, Shangri La has been open to small groups for guided tours and educational programs. The Foundation works together with the Honolulu Academy of Arts, which serves as an orientation center for supervised visits to the Shangri La estate. This partnership has allowed the Academy to in turn add programs and educational activities focusing on Islamic and Hawaiian art and culture as part of its curriculum. Exhibitions, classes, workshops, lectures, film series and performances have all been tied to the Shangri La. Many of the objects on display at the house can now be viewed in a virtual tour online at the Shangri La's web site shangrilahawaii.org. The Academy also sells a catalogue of the Collections in its Gift Shop. There is nothing quite like witnessing the originals in person, however. The public rooms of the estate's main house have been preserved and refurbished to appear just as were during Duke's life. Restoration of other parts of the property is ongoing, and as sections are completed, they too are opened to public viewing. Admission is by guided tour only. Advance reservations are required via phone or e-mail. Non-refundable tickets, which cost $25 per person, will be sent via U.S. mail and may need to be reserved several months ahead of arrival. At the time of this writing, group reservations and school tours were not available. All tours begin at the Honolulu Academy of Arts, located at 900 South Beretania Street, between Victoria Street and Ward Avenue. A minivan is used to take groups of no more than twelve persons at a time to the Shangri La property. The ride takes only 15 minutes one-way and the tour lasts approximately 90 minutes."

"South Point (Ka Lae)","Hawaii","South Point (Ka Lae) - Naalehu, Big Island, Hawaii - America's Southernmost Tip","In the continental United States, Florida's Ballast Key is the country's southernmost point, and Key West is its southernmost city. But even closer to the equator than these is the region of the Big Island of Hawaii known as South Point. Ka Lae, which is Hawaiian for South Point, is a rocky outcropping that stretches to meet the Pacific Ocean at a latitude of 18°55'N, almost six degrees further south than Ballast Key. The area's main community, Naalehu, sits at 19°3?57?N, making it America's southernmost town. In fact, Naalehu is 497 miles further south than Miami and 994 miles further south than Los Angeles. If you were to set out by boat from Ka Lae and head due south, the next continental land mass you would reach would be the shores of Antarctica, some 7,500 miles away. South Point is currently uninhabited, although experts believe this is where Tahitians and other South Sea Islanders landed when they first came to Hawaii, perhaps as early as 400 A.D. Ruins of heiau (temples), fishing shrines and other cultural vestiges can still be seen in the area, which has been declared a National Historical Landmark. To get to the rocky coast that marks the southern tip of the Big Island, about 52 miles southeast of Kailua-Kona, take the South Point Road turnoff from State Highway 11. The narrow drive to Ka Lae passes through twelve miles of open ranch land en route to the sea. A field of huge white wind turbines can be seen along the way, generating electricity for the region. The road passes through an area designated as South Point Park before reaching the coastal waters. Visitors should be aware that the last five miles of South Point Road are quite rough, and using a four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended. The parking area can be found at the end of the road, about a mile past the fork to Green Sand Beach. The cliffs near South Point Park are commonly used as a mooring spot for fishermen who work the teeming waters here. From the edge of the rocks, the drop is about forty feet to the ocean, and the base of the cliff extends another thirty feet below the water's surface. Ladders have been hung to allow access to the boats, and they may be seen swinging freely in the air above the sea. Some may be tempted to consider diving into the clear waters from the cliff. This is not advisable, however. A swift current, known as the Halaea Current, runs along the shore and sweep anyone who dives in the water straight out to sea. The current is named after a Hawaiian chief who was carried off to his death here. Look for a black-and-white light beacon not far from the cliffs. A small heiau can be seen there, marking Ka Lae. Also in the South Point area is Mahana Beach, noted for its green sands that contain flecks of olivine. Other recreational sites in the vicinity include Naalehu Park with its Hawaii County maintained tennis courts and Pahala Park, which has a community center, a swimming pool and a ball field."

The building is on Wainee and Prison streets. It was named stuck in irons house because of the standard wall shackles and ball and chain restraints of the time period. Sailors were kept in the fort if they did not return to their ships before sunset before the prison was built. According to the history books the fort physician in 1851 stated that prisoners should not sleep on the ground as it could make them ill and such an issue was a liability to the government. It was decided that a prison would need to be built so the facility was built to serve Lanai, Molokai, and Maui and named Hale Pa'ahao.  The prison was finished in 1852 after being built with planks. There were separate quarters for men and women. Guards used catwalks to patrol and most prisoners were taken in for ship desertion, drunkenness, reckless horse riding, or working on the Sabbath. Anyone jailed for more than a year would be sent to Oahu. Today the prison is available for community use with a park area around it."

"The Challenge at Manele","Hawaii","The Challenge at Manele, Lanai City, Hawaii - A Thrilling Jack Nicklaus Signature Course Overlooking the Pacific Ocean","The Challenge at Manele is a Jack Nicklaus signature design that combines cliff side, ocean, gorge and ravine carries, sweeping ocean and mountain vistas, and excellent conditioning. The par-72, 18-hole course plays to 7,039 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 132. From the White tees, it's a much more manageable 5,874 yards. The course is situated on 200-foot cliffs, and runs along the coastline of Hulopoe Bay and the area's natural red lava fields. Like most Nicklaus-designed courses, The Challenge calls for precise shot-making...and then some. Three of the holes are on cliffs that make use of the Pacific Ocean as a water hazard, and it's not uncommon to find the pins positioned close to a cliff's edge. The natural terrain is both dramatic and unspoiled, and every hole provides a stunning view of the blue Pacific. During the winter months, golfers may even sight some cresting whales. The signature hole for The Challenge is No. 12, which was also the site of Bill Gate's wedding, along with many others. The par-3 hole has been described as thrilling,'' and brings golfers back again and again. The hole conceals a dramatic drop to the ocean, and demands a 185-yard carry off the men's tee from a cliff, over the ocean, to a green located on another cliff 150 below. No. 16 is a par-4 that plays up to 458 yards from the back tees, and 371 from the Whites. The hole is a dogleg left that has an elevation drop of 100 feet from the tee to the green. Golfers much avoid a number of white-sand bunkers along the way as they play toward a green set against the backdrop of the blue Pacific. Another dramatic and noteworthy hole is No. 17, which demands a 215-yard carry over the ocean from the back tee. There are also a number of blind tee and approach shots on the course, as well as deep bunkers with multiple fingers. The course also features nine doglegs and some brutish par-5s that zig and zag across the natural terrain.

"The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel","Hawaii","The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel - Honolulu, Hawaii - Japanese-owned Hotel near Diamond Head","Nestled between the white sands of San Souci Beach and 500-acre Kapiolani Park, the original Kaimana Beach Hotel was built in 1903 on the residential site of the McInerny family, owners of a major Honolulu mercantile business. The grounds were once visited by Robert Louis Stevenson, who used to rest in the shade of a great Hau tree here. In 1964 major renovations were made by a consortium of new owners, including the Japan's New Otani Hotel, transforming the property into a 9-story high-rise with 156 rooms. The design concept was to blend Polynesian and Asian culture, as evidenced by the hotel's two restaurants, the locally inspired Hau Tree Lanai Restaurant and the Japanese-cuisine Miyako, both of which are still serving today. The New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel now has 125 rooms - all non-smoking - including 31 suites and 16 rooms with kitchenettes. Each room has a private lanai, with views of the Ocean, Waikiki or Diamond Head.

"The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory","Hawaii","The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory - Kailua-Kona, Big Island, Hawaii - Single Source for Pure Hawaiian Chocolate","Beginning in 1997, the owners of the Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory, Bob and Pam Cooper, dedicated themselves to creating delicious and unique confections that were truly Hawaiian grown and made. Today, this Kailua-Kona-based enterprise is the only chocolate company in the state that grows, processes and markets its product entirely in Hawaii. The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory harvests its crop of cacao beans from an acre of trees on the Kona Coast and another fourteen acres on the far side of the island at Keaau. According to chocolate maker and proprietor Bob Cooper, there is something about the volcanic soil of the Big Island, along with its predictable showers and tropical Hawaiian sun that gives the beans from this locale a unique flavor. It's a cottage industry,'' Cooper told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin in an interview. Indeed, the factory actually looks a cottage that has been converted for production and retailing. Cooper invested roughly $250,000 in equipment to turn the cacao beans into milk chocolate and dark chocolate bars. Production is completely self-contained here. To produce local chocolate, the cacao pods must first be hand picked, and then the beans must be culled and sun dried before processing. The drying process alone takes anywhere from 22 to 28 days. Sweat boxes, drying racks, a concher and a tempering tank are used to render chocolate from the beans. According to Cooper, purity and quality are critical to creating a single-origin Hawaiian chocolate of distinctive texture and taste. The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory's finished products come in a variety of styles, the most popular being the individual bars. They are sold in both quarter pound and one pound sizes, and three different grades are available: Milk Chocolate, Dark Chocolate and Criollo Dark Chocolate. Each bar is hand-poured and scored for breakable bite-size pieces. The surface is embossed with the OHC logo or signature Plumeria flower. There are also small plumeria-shaped pieces that come in large and small sizes. And a relatively new addition to the line-up is a product called Roasted Cacao Nibs. These are 100% cacao beans, roasted, shelled and broken into bite-size pieces, representing the essence of pure chocolate, which can be used for snacks and in making smoothies. Apart from chocolate, the Coopers also sell 100% Private Reserve, Whole Bean Kona Coffee. The beans come from the orchards of Kahalu'u, and the gourmet dark roast coffee is said to be a natural compliment to rich Hawaiian chocolate. The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory sells branded tee-shirts, too, featuring the OTC logo and signature Plumeria flowers printed in chocolate brown. The catchphrase Chocolate is Aloha'' appears on the sleeve. Another special souvenir the Coopers have developed is a Chocolate is Aloha! Tour'' DVD. It shows the process of making chocolate from tree to finished products and retails for just $15. The Original Hawaiian Chocolate Factory is located on the slopes of Hualalai Mountain at 78-6772 Makenawai Street, Kailua-Kona, Hawaii 96740. It is near the intersection of State Highway 11 and Kamehameha III Road."

There are other Kamehameha I statues in Hawaii, but the one on the Big Island is the original. It stands close to downtown Hilo at the end of Wailoa River State Recreation Area in the north. The king statue faces Hilo Bay. It is a 14 foot statue designed by sculptor R. Sandrin.  He created the statue in Fracaro Foundry which is in Vicenza, Italy. The statue was completed in 1963, but it was not erected or dedicated on this site until 1997. The statue was commissioned by the Princeville Corporation for their resort in Kauai. They spent $125,000 on it. The people in Kauai did not want the statue because Kauai was never conquered by the King. Given this issue it was put on hold and finally because Hilo was important for the King as a political center the Princeville Corporation donated it to the Big Island. The statue is set atop a stone platform. The king is covered in a golden robe and holds his kingly staff. The image is very much a likeness to the king."

"The Painted Church","Hawaii","The Painted Church","The Painted Church is also known as St Benedict Roman Catholic Church and is located on Painted Church Road in Captain Cook on the Island of Hawaii. The church is approximately 25 miles from Kona International Airport and overlooks Kealakekua Bay. Mass is celebrated most days here and on the second Sunday of each month is the Hawaiian Mass followed by breakfast.  The church was built in 1899 by Father John Velghe, who used house paint to adorn the church with his own paintings. There are six pictures on the side walls depicting scenes such as the temptation of Jesus, St Francis of Assisi receiving the stigmata and hell. Above each picture lunettes were meant to be added, but unfortunately Father John only managed to complete one over the picture of St Francis. Elsewhere in the church visitors will see a gothic theme including the reproduction of the nave of the Cathedral of Burgos in Spain. The belfry and the lattice work entry are notable aspects of the exterior of the church. After a trip to the church visitors can take a short journey to the historic City of Refuge, which is a 182 acre site featuring temple platforms, royal fishponds and sledding tracks."
"The Palms Cliff House Inn","Hawaii","The Palms Cliff House Inn - Honomu, Big Island, Hawaii - Boutique Bed & Breakfast North of Hilo","Located beside the ocean in the old Hawaiian plantation town of Honomu, the Palms Cliff House Inn is a privately owned and operated bed and breakfast that has been pampering guests since its opening in 2000. Its limited accommodations - only eight rooms - means every visitor gets special attention from the proprietors, John Kaniukuumakekai Gamble and Michele Kealaokapualokomaika'i Gamble, whose aim is to recreate Hawaii's old world charm.'' When the Gambles decided to open their home to guests as a boutique B&B, they wanted to create an atmosphere as unique as the Big Island. To do so, they focused on providing luxuries similar to those found at large, upscale resorts, such as private entrances, private bathrooms, quiet rooms, and truly comfortable beds. Each of the inn's rooms has its own distinct character. Several of them - namely the Orchid Suite, The Garden Suite, The Hawaiian Views Suite and The Paradise Views Suite - have their own gas fireplaces and sitting areas. Each of these also features a large two-person Jacuzzi, placed within a round alcove in the suite that overlooks the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, the lanais of all eight rooms, each of which faces the sea, are just 40 feet from the cliff that runs along Pohakumanu Bay. The area is free of vog'' (volcanic smog) and the views can be quite stunning, not only during the day when the sun shimmers off the water, but also at night when stars can be seen all the way down to the horizon. Standard room amenities include a telephone, dial-up Internet access, a television with a DVD player, a CD player with iPod jack (on request), and free use of the inn's 600+ DVD library. Each corner suite has an oversized marble shower. All rooms come with extra bed pillows, bath amenities, a refrigerator, safe, iron and ironing board, a hair dryer, ceiling fans, and air conditioning (upstairs only). Other special treats include an ice cooler for outings and a yoga mat for in-room stretching. WiFi is available in the guest lounge. Apart from room amenities, visitors can appreciate the dining side of the Palms Cliff House Inn, too. The room rates include a full hot breakfast for two. Menu items range from Apple Banana Pancakes and Taro Bread French Toast to Mango Dutch Bake and other home-cooked main dishes. Sausages, muffins, and fresh fruit accompany every morning meal, which is served daily between 7:30am and 9am. Privacy is certainly one of the keywords that define the Palms Cliff House Inn, as is hospitality. Another is romance. The Gambles happily admit that their bed and breakfast is popular with couples. They also offer individualized spa services, such as Lomi Lomi Pohaku Hawaiian Massage and Couples Massage, in conjunction with professional, licensed massage therapists. The Palms Cliff House Inn is located at 28-3514 Mamalahoa Highway, Honomu, Hawaii 96728. To get there from Hilo, take State Route 19 north toward Kona for about 15 minutes.

"The Pipeline","Hawaii","The Pipeline - Haleiwa, Hawaii - Surfing the Famed Wave on Oahu's North Shore","Anyone who has ever seen a surfing film where the wave is so high that it curls right over the surfers' head knows what a barrel'' or pipeline'' looks like. But when surfers talk about The Pipeline,'' they are referring to the waves offshore from Ehukai Beach Park, a place known as surfdom's ''Holy Grail.'' Also called The Banzai Pipeline,'' this wall of water can be found along Kamehameha Highway, seven miles northeast of Haleiwa on Oahu's North Shore. In winter, the waves crest at 20-feet or higher, making this the ideal location for surfing competitions and honing professional wave-riding skills. The term Banzai'' derives from a Japanese battle cry or patriotic cheer. It literally means (may you live for) ten thousand years.'' As surfing legend has it, cinematographer and surf film pioneer Bruce Brown was making a movie called Surfing Hollow Days'' with legendary surfer Wayne Miyata in 1961. They came upon The Pipeline and nobody thought it could be ridden. But Brown asked California champion Phil Edwards to give it a try. Reluctant at first, Edwards paddled out, caught a huge cresting barrel, skimmed along its surface, and came right back in to shore. As Edwards dropped down the vicious wave, Brown shouted out, Banzai!'' The entire event was captured on film, and the world would soon learn that the Ehukai Beach Park was the home of the Banzai Pipeline.'' Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, The Pipeline was hailed as the greatest test in world surfing.'' Before long, the Association of Surfing Professionals made the Pipeline Masters the final stop on its annual world tour each December. The Vans Triple Crown of Surfing is held here, too. To keep an eye on the surf, wind and tide conditions, a web cam has been set up to deliver images of The Pipeline over the Internet 24/7. Monstrous waves and huge wipeouts keep the crowds coming here year after year. What makes The Pipeline so special is the way its hollow, tubular waves break over the shallow reef so close to shore. Surfers say its famous lefts break best on west or northwest swells toward Kaena Point, while north lines tend to make the barrel close out. There is also a Backdoor Pipeline to the right which delivers long, fast barrels, but without a channel back out. Wave selection is critical to a good ride. Not every swell is makeable. As waves reach 6~8 feet, they begin breaking over the second and third coral reefs, then curl over as they hit the first. Professionals note that the drop is almost always late, and the wave keeps getting bigger as the boarder nears bottom. These waves are not for amateurs. Spring and summer, on the other hand, bring flat conditions, when other activities can be enjoyed, such as snorkeling, scuba diving, jet skiing, swimming, sunbathing and wading along the sandbar. From June to September, however, visitors need to be wary of stinging Limu (seaweed) washed in by the tide and wind. Lifeguards are on duty at Ehukai Beach Park. There are also picnic areas and tables, shady spots, restrooms, showers and public phones nearby. Bring water, apply sunscreen and wear a hat, if intending to stay for the day. Crowds can be heavy during surf season, in particular. The parking lot holds only 25 vehicles, so it may be necessary to park along the highway. The address is 59-337 Ke Nui Road, Haleiwa, HI 96712-8600."
"The Roaring Sands","Hawaii","The Roaring Sands","The Roaring Sands are also known as the Barking Sands. They are found on the west coast of Kauai, Hawaii close to Mana. The dunes run parallel to the coast for approximately a mile. The dunes are unique for their color and minerals. These particular sand dunes contain carbonate sand which means they are water and wind worn fragments of shells and corals rather than other types of sand. One can look at the sand under a microscope to see the different corals and shells. Other booming dunes around the world are usually quartz sand grains, which is another reason the Roaring Sands are unique.  Booming dunes, which are the classification of the Roaring Sands are those that offer a strange sound such as a squeak which is produced by the compression of sand with the foot. It means when a visitor walks over the dunes they will roar due to the minerals, coral, and shells present to make up the sand. The sand underneath the top layer is like a sounding board which helps to produce the large sound one hears when walking over them. As a natural phenomenon these sands are often visited by travelers to the island."

"Thomas Square","Hawaii","Thomas Square","Thomas Square is a Honolulu Hawaii park, which was named after Admiral Richard Darton Thomas. In February 1943 the HMS Carysfort carrying Lord George Paulet was situated out in the bay just off the island. Paulet seized the Kingdom of Hawaii, occupying it and establishing the Provisional Cession of the Hawaiian Islands.  That same year but six months later Admiral Richard Darton Thomas came into Honolulu Harbor on the HMS Dublin. He became the representative of the British Commission outranking Paulet. Roughly a month later, Thomas gave the island back to King Hamehameha III. It is this reason that Kamehameha III decided to give the square in downtown Honolulu Thomas's name. In 1925 the square was made into a park and it is currently managed by City and County of Honolulu. It was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. On July 31 of every year a celebration occurs called Restoration Day in English since it was the day Hawaii was given back to the King. Thomas Square always has decorations for the holiday. The pathways of the park were also made in the shape of a British Flag. There is a fountain in the center and it is surrounded by trees."

"Thurston Lava Tube, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park","Hawaii","Thurston Lava Tube, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Journey Inside a Volcano","One of the top attractions of the Big Island's renowned Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is a journey to the center of the earth'' through the Thurston Lava Tube. This short hike takes visitors right inside a recently active volcano - Kilauea - which was responsible for a 1959 eruption that produced spectacular lava fountains - among the hottest and highest in Hawaiian history. Lava tube caves are formed when fluid lava passes through the earth's crust to the surface. The longest and most vertically extensive lava tubes in the world are found on the Big Island of Hawaii. As lava flows down the side of a volcano, the upper layer cools and solidifies. The molten lava below is insulated by the hardened lava and continues to flow in conduits beneath the surface, sometimes for great distances underground, with very little cooling. A few Hawaiian tubes have carried lava 50 miles or more from their source. Once drained of the molten rock, the empty tubes are much like limestone caves. They often have stalactites and stalagmites. Their walls, however, may be smoothed or rutted by the lava that created them. The entrance to the Thurston Lava Tube, also called Nahuku,'' can be found at the east side of the parking lot, away from Kilauea Crater near the park's Visitor Center. There is an interpretive sign posted by the parking lot fence, and it directs hikers up an easy climb leading off to the right where the lava tube walkway begins. The entry point is surrounded by lush rain forest vegetation, giving little indication of the mighty forces that formed this terrain. The path descends gradually, and then more steeply, covering about a third of a mile on the way to the tube's orifice. A bridge must be crossed to the mouth of the tube, and it leads down to a nearly flat lava floor. The interior of the Thurston Lava Tube has been lit with electric bulbs to permit viewing, although it is a good idea to bring along a flashlight to explore features hidden by the natural darkness. It is evident how the flowing magma smoothed the tube's otherwise rugged walls. There are tree roots hanging down from the ceiling and water drips through cracks in the rock above. When the tube was first discovered in 1913 by Lorrin Thurston, a local newspaper publisher, the roof was covered with lava stalactites, too. However, these soon disappeared, carried away by souvenir collectors. Visitors walking through the tube need to be mindful of the low ceiling in spots, but there are no real dangers associated with the tube. The lava stopped flowing here hundreds of years ago. It currently travels from Pu'u O'o to the ocean via a labyrinth of separate lava tubes much like this one. At the far end of Thurston Lava Tube, a set of stairs leads back to the surface. From here, the rest of the volcanic crater can be explored along the Kilauea Iki Trail to the rim, or visitors may loop back to the parking lot along the rain forest path. The Kilauea Visitor Center is located at Crater Rim Drive, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96785. Rangers are on duty here to provide assistance for hikers, including trail information, maps, and permits. The center is open from 7:45am to 5pm daily. The entry fee is $10 per vehicle."

This is one of the most popular beaches of the island in spite of the fact that it is not ideal for swimming due to the beach-rock that lines Haena Point. However, a big attraction is the offshore reef, which is a great location for snorkeling and diving. There is an inner and an outer reef here with the former great for families with small children, while the latter is ideal for more experienced divers. The outer reef's attraction includes lava tubes, arches and various coral formations, which is why it is popular for divers. It is sometimes possible to see white-tipped sharks whilst diving here. It is recommended to avoid swimming and snorkeling here in the winter months as the water can become quite dangerous.

"US Army Museum of Hawaii","Hawaii","US Army Museum of Hawaii - Honolulu, Hawaii - A Tribute to Hawaii's Defenders","The US Army Museum of Hawaii is located in the Battery Randolph at Waikiki's Fort DeRussy. Exhibits and educational programs that recall the role of Hawaii in military actions from ancient tribal days through the Vietnam Conflict are its focus. Silent helicopters, tanks and guns along with vacant bunkers give testament to more turbulent times. This area was once a bastion that protected the island from invading forces. Now, separate displays with photographs and sounds recreate the experiences of the past. The objective of the museum is to tell the stories of the men and women who shaped Hawaii's heritage. There are tributes to warriors who built a kingdom here, soldiers who defended Oahu from attacks, and local individuals who served their country to keep it free. The exhibits are separated into several sections as a kind of chronology of military involvement. Visitors start out in the Introduction Foyer and move on to the gallery of Hawaiian Warfare, which depicts the lives of warriors and their weaponry a thousand years before Columbus sailed to the New World.'' One display is dedicated to Camp McKinley, the first U.S. Army camp in Hawaii, established in 1898 in what is now Kapiolani Park. It housed the 1st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment who traveled here by ship. Another display features the first test firings of the guns of Battery Randolph in November 1914. Waikiki residents were warned to expect commotion, but shock waves rocked the neighborhood breaking windows and causing more than a little distress. In later years, as Waikiki grew, the guns were muzzled to avoid disturbing community life. Of course, there is an extensive exhibit given over to the events of December 7, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor is shown through photographs and artifacts. And there is also a section on Hawaii's 160,000 ethnic Japanese, a third of the total population, many of whom were arrested and relocated after the attack. The loyalty and enthusiasm of many Americans of Japanese ancestry was channeled into the Hawaiian Provisional Battalion. Its soldiers were sent in 1942 to the mainland for training, and they later became the 100th Infantry Battalion. Their story is also on display. Other exhibits include those on island defense and army aviation. There is a shell magazine replica on display, and special sections showing Hawaii's role in the Korean War and the Vietnam conflict are also provided. One gallery and its adjoining theater are reserved for temporary exhibits. By introducing new presentations from time to time, the museum is kept fresh for return visitors. There is a gift shop, too, where postcards and other memorabilia can be purchased. Perhaps the most intriguing exhibit at the US Army Museum of Hawaii is its exceptional Gallery of Heroes on the second floor. Developed in 1980, it honors 18 local recipients of the nation's two highest awards of valor: the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Distinguished Service Cross. Across from the Gallery in another room is a separate display honoring 41 Hawaii residents who have received the Distinguished Service Cross of the Navy or Air Force Cross. Responsible for the care of the museum and its exhibits is the non-profit Hawaii Army Museum Society, chartered in 1976.

The U.S. Army Museum of Hawaii is open to the general public from 10am to 4pm daily except Mondays and the corner of Saratoga and Kalia Road. Admission is free of charge, although donations are always welcome. To get there, take Ala Moana Boulevard into Waikiki and turn right onto Kalia Road.

"USS Arizona Memorial","Hawaii","USS Arizona Memorial - Honolulu, Hawaii - Tribute to Lives Lost at Pearl Harbor","Located in Pearl Harbor, two miles west of the Honolulu Airport, the USS Arizona Memorial is managed by the National Park Service (NPS). There are actually two separate facilities to be seen here: the coastal visitor center adjacent to Kamehameha Highway and the actual sunken ship memorial just offshore from Ford Island. Access to the latter is possible only on NPS tours starting shore-side. The USS Arizona (BB-39) was constructed as a 22-gun battleship of the Pennsylvania class. It was commissioned in 1916 and served in World War I. In the following years, the Arizona became the flagship for several battleship divisions. It was retained by the U.S. Pacific Fleet and moored at Pearl Harbor when Japanese bombers attacked the naval base here on December 7, 1941. The story of the USS Arizona's last battle, along with the fate of its crew, is the primary subject of the memorial. The visitor center is open from 7:30am till 5pm daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. Tours here are conducted free of charge, and they begin every 15 minutes between 8am and 3pm. Each tour starts with a short introduction given by a park ranger, a survivor of the attack, or a volunteer. A 23-minute viewing of a film follows, showing the history of the Day of Infamy'' and America's worst naval disaster. When the film ends, visitors are ushered on to launch operated by the U.S. Navy. It ferries them across the harbor to the memorial proper, a 184-foot-long white building erected in directly over the sunken remains of the battleship. This elongated structure was approved for construction by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1958, completed in 1961, and opened to the public in 1962. It replaced the original 1950 memorial, which was a commemorative plaque and simple flagpole attached to the battleship's broken main mast. Although the USS Arizona Memorial honors all 2,390 people who died in the attack, special tribute is given to the 1,177 Arizona crewmen who gave their lives as the warship sank. Many of them are still entombed in the waters below. The memorial building is comprised of three sections. First is the entry and assembly room where visitors gather. The second is the central area used for general observation and special ceremonies. The third section is the shrine room with its marble wall bearing the engraved names of those killed on the Arizona. The remains of the ship itself are visible through the clear surrounding waters. Exploration of the memorial is self-guided, and the entire tour takes about 75 minutes. However, visitors are advised that wait times can exceed two hours during peak holiday periods. Some 1.4 million visitors come to the memorial each year. For those who must wait to be shuttled to the memorial, an audio tour is available, providing information about the visitor center, museum displays and exhibits in the surrounding park area. Oscar-winning actor Ernest Borgnine is the voice of the narration. There is also a small bookstore located at the visitor center, offering various items related to the Pearl Harbor attack. Although admission is free, each guest must obtain a ticket at the visitor center, available only on a first-come, first-served basis. Adults must accompany children under five years of age, and appropriate dress is required for entry; no bear feet or swimwear allowed."

"USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park","Hawaii","USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park - Honolulu, Hawaii - Tribute to World War II Submarines","The USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park is a tribute to the 52 American submarines and some 3,500 crew members that were lost during World War II. Its focal point is the USS Bowfin (SS-287), a fully functional submarine that was launched on December 7, 1942, the first anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The sub was appropriately nicknamed the Pearl Harbor Avenger.'' During its commission, the Bowfin participated in nine wartime missions and sank 44 enemy vessels. A Presidential Unit Citation and a Navy Unit Commendation were awarded to the Bowfin following the war. Today, it is among just fifteen American submarines that survived from World War II and has not been turned into scrap metal or used for target practice. On April 1, 1981, the Bowfin was officially opened to the public as a museum ship.'' It is owned by the non-profit Pacific Fleet Submarine Memorial Association, chartered in 1978. In 1986, the U.S. Department of the Interior designated the Bowfin as a National Historic Landmark To illustrate the history of U.S. submarine service, the facility's 10,000-square-foot museum features a large collection of submarine-related artifacts. These include weaponry systems, paintings, photographs, battle flags, vintage recruiting posters, and intricate submarine models. One exhibit allows visitors to take a close look at the inner workings of a Poseidon C-3 missile; this is the only such missile of its kind allowed by the U.S. government for display in public. Another exhibit shows the Purple Heart medal awarded to the Bowfin's only casualty of war, crew member Reid Lee. He was wounded by shrapnel when the vessel engaged in a surface battle during its seventh patrol. Adjacent to the exhibit is a mini-theater with a seating capacity for 40 guests. Among the submarine-related videos in the theater's collection are more than four dozen episodes of a 1960's television series called The Silent Service.'' It was based upon stories of actual events occurring during World War II submarine patrols. The primary highlight of a visit here, of course, is a tour of the USS Bowfin itself. Sleeping quarters, torpedo bays, the engine room, the control room, the ship's mess and the conning tower are all open to view. Crew rosters and engineering specifications are also on display. Visitors receive portable audio players that narrate what life was like for the 80 submariners who occupied the vessel during war time. As part of a community outreach program, the museum staff also offers t bring presentations to elementary schools in Oahu free of charge. The purpose is to help 4th and 5th grade students become more familiar with the history and functioning of U.S. submarines, in conjunction with their history curriculum. A public memorial on the waterfront near the Bowfin honors those submariners who served and died during World War II. In the gift shop adjacent to the museum, visitors may purchase nautical gifts, pictorial histories and Pearl Harbor souvenirs. Open from 8am to 5pm, the last tour of the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park begins each day at 4:30 p.m. The museum is closed, however, on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day."

Its mission is to promote, develop, and perpetuate the artistic and cultural heritage of Hawaii's people and environment through activities in the visual, literary, and performing arts.'' Toward this end, the VAC Gallery found a natural home at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where Pele, the fiery Hawaiian goddess of the volcano, was said to dwell. The ground here was long considered sacred. It inspired the local people to develop their crafts, songs, dances, and legends. Even now, the area still attracts artists, writers, performers, educators and scientists by the thousands. Displays in the Gallery range from elegant koa wood carvings and handmade glass to fine art. There are also books, clothing items, music, and jewelry for sale here, in addition to ceramics, prints, painting, and sculpture.

Its surroundings include lovely rain forests and fresh mountain air in concert with steaming lava fields and black sand beaches that have attracted visitors by the millions. More than 20 years before Volcano House opened, Chiefess Kapiolani had a grass shack built here on the crater rim. When the first U.S. Geological Survey of the area was conducted in 1846, lodgings were needed for the survey team and the first Volcano House was erected by Benjamin Pitman, Sr. Twenty years later, the house was fortified and expanded using native grass and ohia wood. In 1877, Volcano House was rebuilt with wood. Its welcoming fireplace was added, along with six bedrooms and a large dining room. The continuously tended hearth in the lobby has been a symbol of warm hospitality and aloha spirit'' ever since, surviving an accidental fire that burned down the main building in 1940. When rebuilt in 1941, the accommodations were expanded to 30 rooms. The old-style country lodge has been welcoming guests for more than 135 years, making it the oldest continuously operated hotel in the state of Hawaii. Mark Twain once stayed here and said, The surprise of finding a good hotel at such as outlandish spot startled me, considerably more than the volcano did.''

"W.M. Keck Observatory","Hawaii","W.M. Keck Observatory","W.M. Keck Observatory is located on the summit of Mauna Kea on the Island of Hawaii and is approximately two hour's drive from Hilo International Airport. Prior to visiting the observatory it is recommended that visitors go to the Visitor Information Station of the Onizuka Center for International Astronomy, which is located further down the mountain. This is a good place to learn about the telescopes, the mountain and the stars and planets.  The W.M Keck Observatory houses two of the 13 working telescopes found near the summit of the dormant volcano. The two located at the Keck Observatory are the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, which both stand eight stories tall and weigh 300 tons. The10-meter primary mirrors of the Keck telescopes offer the greatest potential sensitivity and clarity available in astronomy. The location of the observatory is ideal as there are no nearby mountain ranges and the atmosphere is generally clear and dry, with very little light pollution to spoil the view of the night sky. There are other telescopes at the summit operated by various nations such as the James Clerk Maxwell telescope, which is the largest astronomical telescope in the world."

The island is the fifth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and is 38 by 10 miles in size. Waialua Beach is situated on the south eastern coast of the island.  The beach is popular with visitors who can enjoy a variety of watersports here including swimming, snorkeling, surfing and body boarding.

"Waihee Beach","Hawaii","Waihee Beach","Waihee Beach in Maui, Hawaii is near Waihee Municipal Golf Course. It offers a brown sand and rubble beach that formed due to the coral reef off shore. Often shells and driftwood come up to the shore making it a great place for beachcombing. On windy days it can be difficult to swim or snorkel, but it does offer a cool beach when the trade winds are blowing. On a good calm day both swimming and snorkeling are possible. In winter Waihee Beach is known for its surfing. The beach itself is rather narrow and small, so it has a low capacity for beach bunnies. Still, it tends to be one of the less populated beaches probably because most expect it to be busy. It is also a great place for a little privacy.  Kite surfers may sail into the beach and around it because of the trade winds. There are bathrooms, picnic areas, showers, and barbeque grills. Swimming is fine, as is some snorkeling, but it is not the greatest for diving. For those who want to enjoy snorkeling they need to bring their own equipment and pay attention to the surf since there is no lifeguard on duty here."
"Waihee Canyon","Hawaii","Waihee Canyon","Waihee Canyon is viewable from Kanoa Ridge overlook. There is also a trail that takes visitors up a windward slope along the ridge where one can see the canyon below. The canyon is 3000 feet deep. Along the way there are waterfalls and many plants and animals to see.  Those who want to see Waihee Canyon will need to take the trail around the edge as the canyon itself is not usually available to go down into being how deep it is. Instead, it is meant to be viewed as a preserved area where many native plants and animals live. During the hike visitors often see the sloped canyon walls filled with flora and fauna making it look as though the entire canyon is alive with greenery. In fact it is a rainforest area on Maui meaning that it is often beautiful due to the rain, mist, and abundance of life. Snails and small insects can be spotted while hiking the trail. It is not suggested to go off trail since the area is protected. Rather Hawaii asks that any hiker remain on the trail and respect nature. It is possible to take pictures along the canyon trail and of the canyon."
"Waihee Valley Trail","Hawaii","Waihee Valley Trail","Waihee Valley Trail is one of the unexpected Maui hiking trails of Hawaii. Many of the trails are unexpected with waterfalls, plunge pools, swinging bridges, and beach adventures. Waihee Valley Trail is also called Swinging Bridges Trail. At the beginning there is a gradual 300 foot climb before the trail will level out through the rainforest. Hikers will pass bamboo, ginger, avocado, and banyan trees. The trail goes around Waihee River where one walks parallel to the stream and the old irrigation canals. The canals were made by Chinese immigrants.  After a mile in the trail will provide the first swinging bridge which is 12 feet off the ground. There is a newer bridge that is stable to cross, but the older one has duct tape on the bolts, so take the old one at your peril. Kids and adults enjoy the Waihee Valley Trail because of the stream and bridges. There are two river crossings that require care given the slippery rocks. The trail ends at a man made water fall, which can be quite thrilling to jump off of and into the swimming hole which is deep enough to support such a thing. The park entry for the trail is $6 for adults."
"Waikamoi Ridge Trail","Hawaii","Waikamoi Ridge Trail","Waikamoi Ridge Trail is just past mile marker 9 of off Hana Highway. There is a parking lot which may be slightly hard to spot. It is the parking lot for the Waikamoi Ridge Forest Trail and Overlook. The parking area can often be rather crowded with hikers and picnickers. There are picnic shelters before the trail head, with the overlook to the left of the trail head. The trail is a short walk through trees, ferns, and bamboo to the overlook. There is also a short loop trail that takes about a half hour and another that is a one way extension from the loop. The trail is usually easy, but rainfall can make it difficult. Most often the worst section will be on the extension trail if rain has fallen recently because of the downhill area and roots.  The trail is only .8 miles in length on the loop and 1.5 miles with the extension. Depending on the rate of hiking it can be a half hour to hour of hiking. The elevation change is only 100 feet along the entire trail. The trail itself is in north east Maui close to Waihee Canyon and other natural beauties of the island."
"Waikane Falls","Hawaii","Waikane Falls","Waikane or Waikani Falls can also be called Three Bears Falls. The waterfall is just off the highway making it one of the more popular locations to see while in Maui. It has an upper waterfall that is smaller which is part of Wailua Stream. The lower fall which is the true Wailua Falls is a drop of 1,000 feet. As visitors continue to hike the short path along the bridge it is possible to reach Waikane Falls or Three Bears Falls.  Visitors to the island need to drive on Hana Highway toward Hana. Between mile marker 19 and 20, visitors will find the turn off for parking and the hiking path to Three Bears Falls. There are some cautionary facts required before taking this trail. On the whole the trail is easy; however, when there is a lot of rain it can be muddy or slippery, most especially around the actual falls and stream. One needs to use caution in these areas. Water flow will vary on the rainfall too meaning sometimes the water may be higher in the stream, thus crossing should be taken with caution. Visitors can usually hike in and out in a half hour."
"Waikele Premium Outlets","Hawaii","Waikele Premium Outlets - Waipahu, Hawaii - Brand-name Shopping on Oahu","For those who pursue shopping with a passion, the Waikele Premium Outlets offer one of Oahu's great adventures. Gathered here in Waipahu, about 30 miles from downtown Honolulu, are more than 50 name-brand shops, covering nearly 64 acres of retail-zoned space and offering some of Hawaii's best big-brand bargains. The Waikele Premium Outlets are part of the Chelsea Property Group, a division of Simon Property Group, which owns dozens of outlet centers across the United States, as well as locations in Mexico, Japan, and Korea. Operated exclusively under the Premium Outlets and Premium Outlet Shopping names - registered trademarks of Chelsea Property Group - each outlet store here is individually owned and operated by leading designers and manufacturers. Among the categories of goods represented here are designer fashions, sportswear, shoes, children's items, fine leather, luggage, accessories, jewelry, housewares, home furnishings, gifts and specialty items. Among the specific brands featured are A|X Armani Exchange, Banana Republic, BCBG Max Azria, Barneys New York, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach, LeSportsac, MaxMara, Michael Kors, Polo Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Tommy Hilfiger, and more. The decision to locate in the Waikele Premium Outlets was made by each individual company, so the groups here are not identical to those seen at other Chelsea Property Group locations on the mainland. However, every effort has been made by management to create the Island's largest collection of the finest designer brands, while offering savings of 25 to 65 percent every day. To complement the top-name brands of the Premium Outlets, a separate facility has been opened across the street. It carries more practical, less fashion-centered goods. Called the Waikele Center, it houses another two dozen stores, ranging from Eagle Hardware to the Sports Authority. Here you will find restaurants, too, which were deliberately left off of the Waikele Premium Outlets' fashion-not-food tenant list. Those who come to the Premium Outlets often can take full advantage of the Chelsea VIP Shopper Club. It is an Internet-based membership-based club for savvy bargain-hunters, providing online discounts, a voucher for a free VIP coupon book, brand information, special event notification, and e-mail announcements of Deals Around Town.'' Members receive free access to the VIP Lounge, a password-protected portion of the Club website, where merchants post exclusive coupons. No membership card is required - just access to a printer. Another special opportunity for shoppers is a program called 50 Plus Shopper Perks.'' Those who are at least 50 years of age can receive an additional 10% in savings every Tuesday, simply by presenting photo identification with proof of age to the cashier at participating stores. Lists of those shops offering the discount are available at the information desk within the Premium Outlets. Although the trip to Waikele Premium Outlets can take the better part of an hour when traffic is heavy, getting there poses no problem. The Waikele Trolley provides round-trip service daily, combining open-air comfort with narrated tour information as the route passes Aloha Tower and Pearl Harbor. Departures and drop-offs are from central pick-up points throughout Waikiki and the cost is $26 round-trip, with lots of room available for your shopping bags. Alternatively, you can drive there by taking the H-1 Freeway 15 miles west of Honolulu. The Waikele Premium Outlets can be seen directly off the highway at Exit 7. The address is 94-790 Lumiaina Street, Waipahu, HI 96797. You should plan to allow about 5~8 hours for your entire shopping excursion. Hours of operation are 9am to 9pm most days of the week and 10am to 8pm on Sundays, with special extended hours on holidays, but closed for Christmas."
"Waikiki Aquarium","Hawaii","Waikiki Aquarium - Honolulu, Hawaii - An Abundance of Marine Life on Display","Established in 1904 and placed under the direction of the University of Hawaii-Manoa in 1919, the Waikiki Aquarium is the third oldest public aquarium in the Unites States. Its mission is to inspire and promote understanding, appreciation and conservation of Pacific marine life.'' This is accomplished through exhibits, programs, and research focused on Hawaii's aquatic life and that of the tropical Pacific. Each year, some 320,000 people visit the Aquarium, which is located right next to the living reef of Waikiki. More than 3,000 marine organisms are displayed here, representing over 500 species of aquatic plants and animals. The exhibits include an interactive showcase of coral, the SeaVision Theatre with videos about shoreline conservation, sections dedicated to fisheries and aquaculture, Hawaiian ocean habitats and South Pacific marine communities. Clams, groupers, snappers, sea anemones, and long-nose butterfly fish are just a few of living sea entities to be seen here. One popular exhibit is the 1,000-gallon moon jelly tank'' found in the Ocean Drifters Gallery. Its jelly wall'' changes seasonally and may include white-spotted jellies, blue blubbers, sea nettles, box jellies or ctenophores. By far the main attraction here is the Hunters on the Reef'' exhibit. Its 35,000-gallon tank has become the home of Hawaiian sharks and jacks, surrounded by educational panels that introduce shark research, biology, conservation and safety. Recently introduced was a spyball camera'' that allows close-up viewing of the sharks on a television screen. Other exhibits are provided for supervised observation and hands-on interaction with selected marine life, a coral farm, a display centering on giant clams, and a habitat created for Hawaii's endangered Monk seals. Among other unique species displayed at the Waikiki Aquarium are Hawaiian stream gobies, rare deep-reef butterfly fish, bearded armorheads and masked angelfish. Coastal Gardens, featuring native Hawaiian plants that have adapted to life near the sea, are also maintained on the premises. Ongoing research into conservation, nutrition and behavior of marine life is conducted at this site. Students of the University and researchers from around the world come here to study spawning behavior, larval rearing, propagation of reef fishes, identification and treatment of diseases, and coral husbandry, to name but a few of the many disciplines supported by the Aquarium. Among the many awards won by the Waikiki Aquarium for its research and conservation efforts are the 2008 Keep It Hawaii Award, the 2003 Munson Aquatic Conservation Exhibit Award, and the 2003 Edward H. Bean Award for Long-Term Tropical Pacific Coral Propagation. Self-guided tours are most common, although interpretive group tours can be arranged upon request.

"Wailea Golf Resort, Gold Course, Wailea, Maui, Hawaii - The Most Challening of Wailea's Three Championship Golf Courses","Hawaii","Wailea Golf Resort, Gold Course, Wailea, Maui, Hawaii - The Most Challening of Wailea's Three Championship Golf Courses","Wailea Golf Resort features three championship golf courses - the Gold, Emerald and Blue. The most challenging of the three is the Gold Course, dubbed Wailea's Rugged Beauty.'' Every year, the course is home of The Champions Skins Game and host to some of the world's legendary golfers. The 18-hole, par-72 course was created by Robert Trent Jones II, and plays to 7,078 yards from the longest tees, with a slope rating of 139. The course features a rugged, albeit lush, layout that makes use of the natural undulations of the terrain, winding through lava-rock outcroppings, rough indigenous grasses, ancient rock walls, and Kiawe and Wiliwili trees. The Gold Course is said to be designed as a thinking-player's course,'' where strategy, accuracy, shot-making and a little finesse all come into play on the course's doglegs. Length is not nearly as important as accuracy. But perhaps one of the most distracting aspects and difficult hazards of the course are its views. During the course of one round of play, golfers will be treated to views of the ocean, Molokini islet, coconut trees, and perhaps even some cresting whales. While the Gold Course claims not to have a signature hole,'' one of the favorites of golfers who have played the course is No. 8. A par-3, the hole plays to 188 yards from the Blue Tees, but the real challenge and beauty comes as golfers aim toward the ocean and Molokini, a tiny, crescent-shaped offshore islet. Another noteworthy hole is the par-5 No. 7, considered the most difficult hole on the course. At 544 yards from the White Tees, the hole is challenging enough for most weekend golfers. Add in the fact that the hole plays uphill and features two doglegs and a prevailing crosswind, and it will provide challenges aplenty. The Gold Course has been honored by both GOLF Magazine and Golf Digest as one of the country's ten best new resort courses, and the readers of Condy Nast Traveler hailed it as one of the world best-designed courses. The Wailea Golf Resort is also renowned for its ideal golf weather, which is typically sunny with gentle breezes. The resort features a pro shop, with rental clubs and shoes, as well as locker rooms. For instruction, the resort offers the first David Leadbetter Golf Academy to open in Hawaii. David Leadbetter has been hailed as one of the leading golf instructors in the world, and the Academy provides one of the most individual, private learning environments in the game. The teaching facility offers two teeing areas, a chipping green, putting green, and a fairway bunker. In addition to golf, the 1,500-acrea Wailea Resort has six luxury hotels, a number of condominiums and villas, access to five white-sand beaches, spas, pools, and the award-winning Wailea Tennis Club. The Club features eleven courts, including three with lighting for night play, as well as a stadium court that can seat up to a thousand spectators. For dining, there are a number of restaurants, including the casually elegant SeaWatch Restaurant and Joe's in Wailea.

Wailea merges into Makena. The two villages have a combined resident population of less than 6,000 people. Makena State Park at Wailea has some of the most visited beaches here with one stretch of a half mile of white, sandy shoreline. Several golf courses can be found in the area and the Wailea Tennis Club offers 11 courts and a pro shop. The median age of inhabitants here is slightly older than the average for the State of Hawaii as a whole; income levels are also above the statewide average in Wailea. The cost of living here is above the average for the United States. Only about 2% of the population here are native to Hawaii or other Pacific Islands and nearly 3 quarters of the Wailea population are of Anglo heritage. Wailea, Hawaii, was desolate beach and untouched jungle until the 1970's when it was bought by Alexander & Baldwin. From then on it developed as a beach resort area. It has been part of the 'Ulupalakua Ranch until the 1950s when Matson Cruise Lines bought the area.  Some 20 years later its development began. The name brand retail here today indicates that commerce here caters specifically to higher income groups with names like Cartier, Dolce & Gabbana and Luis Vuitton filling the storefronts of the Shops at Wailea mall. At the end of Makena Analui Road, La Perouse Bay is found. The bay is named for a French explorer who landed here after the last eruption of the Haleakala Volcano in 1788. The natural phenomena had destroyed the village of Keonolo, part of which still stands in ruin. A strip of cooled lava rock runs through the bay. There is very good surfing here as well as conditions for diving and snorkeling. About 1 mile down from South Kihei Road is the Ulua/Mokapu Beach. Early mornings provide the best snorkeling here. This beach is small and gets fairly crowded though access to food and facilities makes it an easy beach for a family outing when in Wailea. Wailea, Hawaii hosts several luxury hotels complete with in-house spas and other amenities. Some 30 restaurants offer a wide variety of dining options for residents and visitors including, Italian, Chinese and Japanese food as well as American and California-style Cuisine. For local residents many shopping needs for basics items in the home are purchased in nearby Kihei to the north. There is a Wailea Community Association that maintains the common areas in the planned resort community. The common area is a total of about 30 acres of land. It has a staff of 7 and exercises basic government functioning and policing on the streets and in the parks. The nearest airport from Wailea is located about 15 miles to the north in Kalaluli."

"Wailoa River State Recreation Area","Hawaii","Wailoa River State Recreation Area - Hilo, Big Island, Hawaii - Huge Park in Downtown Hilo","Located on the harbor's edge near Hilo Bay, the Wailoa River State Recreation Area could be thought of as Hilo's equivalent to New York City's Central Park, albeit on a much smaller scale. The capital planners were wise to leave this large, open area along the Wailoa River as a refuge from development, so that all can enjoy the great outdoors right downtown. The Wailoa River State Recreation Area covers 131.9 acres. It includes not only the banks of the Wailoa River, but also the spring-fed freshwater Waiakea Pond, which stretches out alongside it. The pond'' is so large, in fact, that geographers have classified it as a lake. Fishing is permitted here, but those wishing to do so should consult with local guides and resources regarding required permits and restrictions. There is a boat ramp for those who prefer to head for deeper waters, although most anglers simple cast their lines into the pond from the shore. Pleasure boating on Waiakea Pond is also permitted. The Wailoa River, from which the State Recreation Area takes its name, has played a role in Hilo's development since the earliest of times. Seafaring Polynesians arrived in this area about 1100 A.D. and inhabited the shores of Hilo Bay. The river provided them with fresh water for drinking, bathing and irrigating the crops that they farmed. It was also a commercial route for transporting goods in conjunction with the nearby Wailuku River. Today, the Wailoa River State Recreation Area serves the recreational needs of Hilo's 45,000+ residents, as well as its visitors. There are a number of small picnic shelters and a central pavilion that attract families and vacationers alike. The surrounding grassy areas are great places for leisurely strolls or throwing a Frisbee. A number of meandering footpaths and high-arched footbridges lead through the park for walkers, joggers and those who enjoy getting around by bicycle. The Wailoa River State Recreation Area is also the home of a circular exhibition center - Wailoa Center - which offers information services and cultural displays. Monthly art exhibits are held here, and an annual newsletter with a calendar of events is available to subscribers. Accessible by car via Piopio Street, Wailoa Center is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from 8:30am to 4:30pm, and Wednesday from noon to 4:30pm. It is closed on weekends and state holidays. Just in front of Wailoa Center is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha I. Made in Italy in the late 1980s, it is a full 12 feet tall and the King's feet are adorned with gold Roman sandals. Also nearby the Center, memorials to Hilo's Vietnam War veterans and tsunami victims can be seen. Among other facilities that can be found in the Wailoa River State Recreation Area are restrooms, picnic tables, trash cans, and drinking water. There is free parking at end of Pi'ilani Street in downtown Hilo. The area is open daily, year-round, during daylight hours and there is no entrance fee. Visitors should note that camping is prohibited here."
"Wailua Falls","Hawaii","Wailua Falls","Wailua Falls are on Wailua River in Kauai, Hawaii. Wailua River is the only river that can handle boat traffic over just kayaks. The falls are 80 feet. There is a walking path that leads to the bottom of the falls; however, it is considered dangerous due to the mud and slippery rocks. In the past hikers have hung ropes along the path to make it easier, but officials usually come by to remove them.  During ancient times men would jump from the top of the falls in order to prove themselves. Close by are Opaeka'a Falls. The falls are classified as a plunge type. There are two official drops as part of the waterfalls. Wailua Falls was used in the television show Fantasy Island, as part of the opening credits. It is best to visit the falls during the early morning when the sun shines on the water. For those who want to take the path it is possible to take a dip in the water as it is warm enough. Leaping from the falls is not a good idea as it could lead to a fatal accident. The top of the falls is right next to a lookout so no hiking is required to see the top."
"Wailua River","Hawaii","Wailua River","Wailua River is a 2 mile long river running over the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The river was formed by the North and South forks to the west of Wailua. The river ends into the Pacific Ocean. It is the only river that can be navigated with large boats rather than kayaks in the Hawaii Islands. The river is considered a center for activities on the island since boat tours of Fern Grotto, kayaking, and water skiing are all a part of attractions on the river.  The North Fork of the rivers starts around Wai'ale'ale Crater and flows for 12.2 miles to the east, where it joins the South Fork. The South Fork is southwest about 8.1 miles closer to Hanamaulu. It travels over Wailua Falls before it reaches the North Fork junction. Along the river is a bird refuge, Halokila Village, a pool with rope jumping, and Secret Falls. The river is wide enough for boat traffic unlike other rivers in the state. It has been used for several years as a way to transport items from inner Kauai to the ocean. It is mostly used for recreation now though. Tourists can enjoy the rainforest surrounding the river."
"Wailuku River State Park","Hawaii","Wailuku River State Park","Wailuku River State Park is located off Waianuenue Avenue in Hilo on the Island of Hawaii. It is close to the Boiling Pots area and at the end of Pe'epe'e Falls Drive. It is also close to Rainbow Falls Area which is on Rainbow Drive. The state park is open during daylight hours and there is no entrance fee.  The state park is comprised of 16.3 acres. From the park one can see geologic sites and scenic interests such as waterfalls that run along Wailuku River. The Boiling Pots are a succession of large pools that are connected by underground rivers or waterfalls. The water rolls like it is bubbling hence the Boiling Pots name. In some of the pools there are exposed hexagonal columns which help form the basalt lava. Rainbow Falls is 80 feet high and the most renowned falls in the area. It is named for the rainbows which form during the early morning due to mist. There is a legend that says a cave beneath the water falls was the home to Hina, which is the mother of demigod Maui. Facilities onsite include drinking water, trash cans, and restrooms."
"Waimanalo Beach","Hawaii","Waimanalo Beach - Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii - Beach Town on Oahu's East Shore","Waimanalo means potable water.'' This sandy stretch of Oahu's eastern shore was once the site of Waimanalo Landing, a port of call for inter-island steamers and other ships that circled the island while visiting sugar plantations and rural communities. In April 1921, by presidential Executive Order, thirty-eight acres along the coast were set aside for public use, creating what is now known as Waimanalo Beach Park. Over the ensuing years, additional land was added to create the surrounding 75-acre Waimanalo Bay Recreation Area. It includes the long, wide Waimanalo Beach at its center, now a popular destination among tourists and residents alike. It offers excellent conditions for sunbathing and swimming. Athletic fields within the Recreation Area are also well used by sports leagues of the local community. The waters that wash up against the shoreline here are ideal for bodysurfing, boogie boarding, fishing and other water activities. Gently sloping into the ocean, the sandy beach features shady areas for picnicking and ideal grounds for camping (permit required). Amenities include restrooms, showers, picnic tables, public phones, free parking and lifeguards on duty until 5pm each evening. Although Waimanalo Beach has been designated as a Class A Zone, meaning the waters are of good quality and contain no dangerous hazards, swimmers should still take precautions. The Portuguese man-of-war, or stinging jellyfish, has been seen offshore, and during windy weather the wave conditions can become dangerous. It is a good idea to keep a close eye on ocean conditions and always obey all postings, warning signs and flags. At the southeast end of the park area, a town has grown up, also named Waimanalo Beach. It was once part of the Waimanalo Sugar Plantation, established in 1878 by a wealthy part-Hawaiian nobleman named John Cummins. He was the son of Thomas Jefferson Cummins Jr. and High Chiefess Kaumakaokane Papali'ai'aina, a cousin of King Kamehameha I. This region of potable water'' had long been populated by native Hawaiians farmers, who were joined by the descendants of Polynesian and Tahitian settlers. The plantation attracted traders, railroad builders, immigrant workers and missionaries. So Waimanalo Beach soon became something of a microcosm for the melting pot that was the Kingdom of Hawaii. One lasting remnant of those plantation days is the Saint George Catholic Chapel. It is among the oldest parishes in Waimanalo. Built in 1842, it still has a sizable congregation, many of them descendents of the Portuguese and the Filipinos who worked for the sugar company. The Cummins family plantation closed in 1947, but the small coastal town of Waimanalo Beach survived. Today, it covers a total area of 3.0 square miles, about 46 percent of which is water. Since 2000, the population has steadied at about 4,200~4,500. With its close proximity to Honolulu, Kailua and Kaneohe and natural beauty, Waimanalo Beach Park has become one of Oahu's most popular family destinations. To get there, take the H1 East to the Kalanianaole Highway (State Road 72), and then follow it around Makapuu Point north up the coast. The entrance to the park and access to the beach is off Aloiloi Street, just before entering Waimanalo City."
"Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden","Hawaii","Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden - Haleiwa, Hawaii - Three Dozen Gardens with 5,000 Plants","Located on Oahu's North Shore, Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden features 36 major botanical collections, all gathered in a valley that extends from sea level to an elevation of 1,000 feet. Although there are many places on the island to see local plants, the abundance of so many varieties of hibiscus and other native flowers in such close proximity makes this a one-stop introduction to Hawaiian flora. The original Botanical Garden here was established in 1973 on 60 hectares of land. In 2003, the National Audubon Society took over managing Waimea Valley Park, and for several years the facilities were known as the Waimea Valley Audubon Center. Then, in 2007, management responsibilities for the area were assumed by the Hawaii State Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Today, the gardens cover 150 acres, tended by 17 fulltime horticultural, academic, administrative, and research staff. Daily operations are overseen by the Stewards of Waimea Valley, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of the area's pristine spirit. Members come from all walks of life, unified by their support of open access, education, research, recreation, arts, archeology, ecology, publication and green technology. The complete botanical collection is made up of more than 5,000 different tropical and subtropical plants. Many of them are native ferns, flowers and medicinal plants, and a few are listed as endangered Hawaiian species, such as rare dune plants. The Herbarium alone has some 2,000 specimens. Among the 36 separate display areas are erythrina and ground covers, a bamboo grove, a lei garden, ginger and heliconia cultivations, and species representing Guam, Fiji, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and more. Of course, the Arboretum also emphasizes the cultural and ecological resources of the Waimea Valley through its many Oahu-focused displays, including a traditional kauhale, or Hawaiian-style hut. Local residents as well as visiting travelers appreciate the family-friendly atmosphere here. There are gently sloping paths to walk along, old stream trails to hike, and shady areas for picnics or a rest. Local schools schedule field trips to the gardens for educational purposes, while plant enthusiasts, bird lovers, and history buffs enjoy the opportunity to indulge their hobbies in tranquil seclusion. The Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden's hosts around 150,000 guests every year. Its operating hours are 9am to 5pm daily, with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. General admission costs up to $10 for adults and starts at $3~$5 for children, seniors, and military personnel. Kama'aina (local resident) rates are offered, too, and children 3 years old and younger are admitted free. Also free of charge are guided walking tours. They start every hour from 10am to 2pm, except noon, and feature explanations of native plants, local history, and the area's wildlife. Another special feature is the monthly Moon Walk.'' It begins at 8:30pm on the Friday before each full moon, offering an opportunity to see the most-rare of Hawaii's flowers blooming under moonlight. This guided tour does have a fee: $3 per person, $5 per couple, or $7 per family. The address of the Waimea Arboretum and Botanical Garden is 59-864 Kamehameha Highway, Haleiwa, HI 96712. It can be found just near Waimea Bay, inland from State Road 83 and Waimea Beach Park on the North Shore."
"Waimea Bay","Hawaii","Waimea Bay","Waimea Bay is in Haleiwa on the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. It is at the mouth of Waimea River and is situated in Waimea Valley. In Hawaiian Waimea means Red Water.  The bay has a bit of history with Captain Charles Clerke. Clerke made a stop in Waimea Bay in 1779 aboard the HMS Resolution. It was after Captain James Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay. Clerke's expedition only stopped at Waimea Bay before leaving. Waimea Valley was very heavily populated at the time. It also remains the site of Pu'u o Mahuka, which is a Hawaiian temple. The temple can be seen sitting above the bay. In the winter months Waimea bay and the north short are very popular for surfing especially for pipeline. Sunset Beach hosts quite a few surfing contests because of the large waves that come into the bay. The waves are usually a result of winter storms that form in the North Pacific and come on shore at Oahu's north shore. It is usually possible to forecast the best surfing days in advance. It was not until 1957 that the bay was discovered as a great place for surfing."
"Waimea Bay Beach Park","Hawaii","Waimea Bay Beach Park - Haleiwa, Hawaii - The Home of Hawaii's Big Surf","Located on Oahu's North Shore, Waimea Bay was the first stopping point on the island for the crews of the HMS Discovery and HMS Resolution on Feb. 22, 1779. They sailed into the bay to rest and replenish their freshwater supplies before continuing on to Kauai. Although the mariners must have noticed the high waves crashing to the shore, little could they have known that the beach here would someday become one of the world's top destinations for surfing. During the winter months, waves here often reach 25 feet and higher, making it the ideal location for holding surfing competitions, filming surf action movies, and watching monstrous walls of water crash to shore. When the surf crests at twenty feet or more, the inshore breaks can reach as high as twelve feet, so extreme caution is advised for anyone who wants to enter the water in winter. The strong currents and waves can be deadly for inexperienced surfers. Even experienced surfers regard the beach as a challenge. It is important to obey all postings and warnings. No one may enter the water when the swells are large and the riptide current is running strongly out at the center of the bay. The local lifeguards should be consulted by anyone unsure of their swimming or surf riding abilities. After surviving its annual winter pounding, Waimea Bay Beach takes on a completely different character. Because Hawaiian summers often see much rain, the nearby Waimea River erodes the beachfront where its waters flow into the ocean. The estuary becomes a picturesque array of brown and red hues, in contrast to its winter blues. In summer, the waves also calm down, and the shore transforms into a popular venue for swimming, body-boarding, snorkeling and fishing. There is a large sandy beach area, perfect for taking in the tropical Hawaiian sun. Waimea Bay Beach Park has numerous picnic areas with fixed tables and seats. Plenty of parking, pay phones, clean restrooms and freshwater showers are also provided. Outdoor grilling is allowed, too, although guests must bring along their own portable barbecues. At one end of the bay is huge rock outcropping that local children use for climbing and diving into the bay. A tunnel runs through the jump-off rock, large enough to pass through before emerging from the warm waters for another leap. Of course, even in summer strong currents may exist. Waimea Bay has also been the site of shark sightings. Parents should therefore be mindful as their children play on the beach and in the surf, even when the ocean seems calm. There is no charge for admission to Waimea Bay Beach Park, open 24/7. Visitors may find the park filled with people on weekends, as local residents fill the beach and picnic areas with their coolers, sun umbrellas and beach mats. Weekdays tend to be much less crowded. Waimea Bay Beach Park can be easily reached from Honolulu by car, following the H1 west to the H2 north, and then taking Exit 8 toward Wahiawa. After merging on to Kamehameha Highway, Waimea Bay is on the left at HI-83 Kamehameha Highway, HI, 96712."

Kauai is the fourth largest of the Hawaiian main islands and is also the oldest. The canyon is situated on the western side of the island and is the largest one in the Pacific region.  Carved thousands of years ago by rivers and floods flowing from Mount Waialeale, the canyon is now 10 miles long, one mile wide and over 3,500 feet deep. Visitors can see lines in the canyon walls created by lava flows resulting from volcanic eruptions. There are numerous look out points here offering great views of the surrounding area including Kalalau Valley. This area is part of the Kokee State Park where there are over 45 miles of hiking trails running through the canyon as well as Alakai Swamp. Visitors can obtain maps of the trails from the Ranger's Station at the Kokee Museum. It should also be noted that the temperatures at the top of the canyon will be much cooler than in the valley. Sometimes it can be shrouded in cloud during the afternoons."
"Waimea Pier","Hawaii","Waimea Pier","Waimea Pier or Waimea State Recreation Pier is found just off of Kaumualii Highway. It is close to Lucy Wright Beach Park, the Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park, Waimea River Park, and Kauai Veterans Memorial Hospital. Waimea Pier is well known as a fishing pier.  Waimea was first an agricultural port, which had many visitors like Christian missionaries and Russian emissaries. The port was used in the early 1800s as a whaling and sugar port. Waimea Pier was originally built in 1865 as a way to transport sugar from the port to other parts of the world. The pier was abandoned in the 1930s as a commercial pier. It is now solely used as a recreational pier. To get to the pier one can head down Kahakai. The pier tends to be one of the busiest with numerous people during the popular vacation months. It has become more difficult to fish at the pier since it is more popular. Furthermore, fish have stopped coming close to the pier. It could be an issue or overfishing or changes in fish patterns. Waimea Pier is close to several other attractions in Kauai like Waimea Canyon, which is just 30 minutes away."
"Waimea Theater","Hawaii","Waimea Theater","Historic Waimea Theater opened in 1938 on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. The first show featured at the theater was Josette staring Simone Simon, Robert Young, and Don Ameche. The theater was built for the Waimea Amusement Company. It cost $25,000 at the time to build it. The architecture was Fred Fujioka from Honolulu. The structure still retains its art deco architecture. At the time it was a 500 seat theater with a wood structure and concrete front.  In 1972 the theater was closed. The building was turned into a warehouse and retail spaces. Hurricane Iniki destroyed some of the building like the marquee and front in 1992. It took until 1999 for the movie theater to be restored and re-opened to the public. It took $40,000 in renovations to get the theater started again. The seating is now able to accommodate 270 people. It has a small stage, big screen, new sound system, snack bar, and rattan seat loge section. Movie Prices are $8 for adults, $7 for students, seniors, military, and $6 for children. Seniors are considered anyone 55 and older. Children are ages 5 to 10.

"Waimea Valley","Hawaii","Waimea Valley - Haleiwa, Hawaii - Natural Habitat with a Popular Waterfall","Waimea Valley covers 1,875 acres of unspoiled nature on the North Shore of the island of Oahu. Wind and rain carved this lush valley from the Ko`olau Mountain range approximately two million years ago, and it has survived as a habitat for native flora and fauna ever since. Also known as The Valley of the Priests,'' Waimea was awarded by the ruler of Oahu to the k�huna nui, descendants of a great spiritual leader named Pa`ao. From 1090 until 1886, they lived here and cared for the local environs, making this a sacred place for native Hawaiians. In 2006, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs - in conjunction with the City and County of Honolulu, the Hawaii State Department of Land Natural Resources, and the U.S. Army - acquired the Waimea Valley property as part of a cooperative conservation land purchase. Two years later, nonprofit Hi`ipaka LLC was established to manage the region and hold the deed. All of the attractions seen here today come under Hi`ipaka's jurisdiction. Among them are 78 distinct Hawaiian archaeological sites, which include religious sites and shrines, ancient dwellings, agricultural terraces and fishponds. The valley's 150-acre Botanical Collection features over 5,000 kinds of tropical and subtropical plants. Many of these are native ferns and flowering plants, and some are listed as endangered Hawaiian species. An abundance of natural wildlife can be found in Waimea Valley, too. There are varieties of rare waterfowl - the `alae `ula (Hawaiian Moorhen), for instance - and migratory shore birds, such as plovers and turnstones. Four of the island's five native freshwater fish breed in Kamananui Stream; peacocks and the ubiquitous Indian mongoose roam freely; a vast array of invertebrates populate the dense vegetation; and Hawaii's only indigenous land mammal, the hoary bat, makes the valley its home. Free walking tours are offered to help visitors get the most out of their paid admission, which ranges from $3 for local children and seniors to $10 for non-resident adults. The walks start every hour from 10am to 2pm, except noon, and they feature explanations of native plants, history, and wildlife. Several other complimentary activities are provided to expose guests to local culture. These include including flower lei making, kapa (cloth weaving) demonstrations, hula dancing lessons, and Hawaiian games, crafts, music and story telling. A must-see attraction for all visitors is the 45-foot Waih? Waterfall, also known as Waimea Falls. It is located just three-quarters of a mile from the park entrance booth, and swimming is permitted in the pool below. For those who become hungry, the Waimea Valley Grill serves full meals and drinks throughout the day. Tropical smoothies, fresh fish sandwiches and native Hawaiian salads are just a few of the menu items that are made using locally grown ingredients. The valley also has a retail store, Ku`ono Waiwai, which displays the arts and crafts of talented North Shore residents. Weekly demonstrations by featured artists are scheduled and listed on the Hi`ipaka events calendar. Sites may be booked in Waimea Valley for functions of up to 350 people to take full advantage of the lush vegetation, the waterfall, meadows, an open-air pavilion and a covered gathering space. Operating hours are 9am to 5pm daily, except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. The address is 59-864 Kamehameha Highway, across from Waimea Bay."
"Waimea Waterfall","Hawaii","Waimea Waterfall - Haleiwa, Hawaii - Natural Waterfall for Swimming and Photos","The Waimea Waterfall is located on Oahu's North Shore in the heart of Waimea Valley. It pours down 45 feet from the Waimea River, which cuts through the Ko`olau Mountain range to a pool that has long been popular as a local swimming hole. Also known as Waimea Falls, Waimea Park Falls, or Waimea Valley Falls, its ancient Hawaiian name is actually Waih?, which means trickling falls.'' Long ago, the Hawaiians believed the Waimea River had medicinal powers. Wounded soldiers would be carried to the waterfall and placed in the water below as a healing treatment. The falls were first visited by foreigners in 1779, when Captain Charles Clerke of the HMS Resolution described the area as uncommonly beautiful and picturesque.'' Since 1974, when Waimea Valley was opened for tourism, the falls have become one of the most photographed natural attractions on the island. Today, the waterfall can be reached just three-quarters of a mile from the Waimea Valley park entrance booth. It is an easy, paved walk, accessible by stroller and wheelchair, which passes through beautiful botanical gardens. The main path rises gently, gaining an elevation of about 300 feet from the start. Even with stops to take photos along the way, the upward journey takes no more than 50 minutes. Upon arrival at the falls, visitors may be surprised to see that the pond waters look rather muddy and not crystal clear. To some, they may appear too murky for swimming. But the reddish-brown tint is not from pollution. It is caused by iron oxide contained in the volcanic soil carried down from the mountains by the Waimea River. For those who wish to slip into a swimsuit, changing booths are located next to the lifeguard station beside the natural pool. Restrooms and a snack bar serving shaved ice and soft drinks are also available nearby. The pond's water temperature averages around 70?F year-round. To go for a swim, children under 12 years of age must wear life vests. These are provided free of charge by the life guards, who will also take photos for guests and are always happy to receive tips for their services. At times when rains have been heavy, branches and debris pour down from the falls and the pond may be closed for swimming. A sign at the entrance to the park will notify visitors of closings, so that it is not necessary to hike all the way in just to be disappointed. Phoning ahead is also recommended, if swimming is the primary objective of a visit to the falls. In years past, live performances were staged at the falls, with cliff divers putting on daily shows. Actors dressed as warriors would re-enact games of skill and courage, climbing up the sides of the waterfall and diving from the 45- and 60-foot ledges into the waters encircled by smooth volcanic rock. However, these shows were curtailed after ownership of Waimea Valley was assumed by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs in 2006 and cliff diving is prohibited The Waimea Waterfall is open daily, 9am to 5pm, except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Admission fees to Waimea Valley range from $3 for children and seniors to $10 for nonresident visitors. To get there by car from Honolulu, drivers can take the H1 west bound to the H2 and follow the signs to the North Shore. The Wahiawa Exit leads to Kamehameha Highway, and the park is on the right, just past Waimea Bay Beach Park."

It was dedicated by King Kamehameha the Great. The establishment of the church was important to the Christian foundation in Hawaii. The church is almost two centuries old now, making it one of the oldest churches in all of the United States. It has a legacy that is still practiced today and will remain. The church has the Waiola Cemetery for those who want to look at ancient graves or remember their ancestors.  The church is open daily from 9am to 4pm. Sunday service is at 9am to 10am each week. Numerous missionaries traveled to Hawaii during the 1800s bringing with them their religion. The King felt it was necessary for Hawaii to accept outside learning and religion in order to understand the world better. It is why the church was dedicated by the king. Hawaiian religion is still practiced by many, though they may also feel close to the Christian religion. The church shows visitors the mixture of culture and heritage that Hawaii has. The church is open for tours for free, thus it is an important stop to make."

It is the largest and most southern of the seven valleys that occupy the windward side of the Kohala Mountains. At its coastal egress, this valley is a mile wide, and it cuts inland almost six miles deep. Its mouth features a lovely black sand beach, washed by the blue waters and white surf of the Pacific. And the valley's sides are marked by cliffs that reach heights of about 2,000 feet. Here, a number of waterfalls can be seen cascading down to the valley floor. A visit to Waipi'o Valley begins west of Honokaa town at the terminus of State Route 240, also known as Waipio Road. The highway ends at the Waipio Valley Lookout, and only those with horses or a four-wheel drive vehicle can venture further without hiking. From the lookout, the view of the valley and its beach is stunning, certainly worth a few photographs before heading off to the valley floor. The partly paved road that leads downward from Waipio Valley Lookout is extremely steep, reaching a gradient of 25 degrees. Over the course of just a mile, it drops 1,000 feet, which can make the descent quick, but the return journey a bit strenuous. On the valley floor, the tropical vegetation is lush with ferns, exotic flowers, and fruit trees. Signs of animals may be evident in the underbrush, and wild horses can sometimes be seen grazing in the grassy areas. You will also discover a small river that winds through the valley, which may be difficult to cross following rainy periods. Which direction you hike from the valley floor is up to you - east to the beach or deeper into the rainforest. The seashore can be quite appealing for a picnic or sun bathing, although the waves can be quite violent, especially in winter, and swimming and snorkeling are not recommended. Perhaps the top attraction in Waipi'o Valley is its waterfalls. Following along the coast east of the beach, you come to Kaluahine Falls and then and Waiulili Falls. Or head to the west of the paved road to get a view of spectacular Hi'ilawe Falls. Facing the sea, it drops straight down from the cliffs, and at a height of some 1,400 feet, it is the tallest waterfall in Hawaii. If you choose to explore inland, mind the irrigation ditches, and don't pick the fruit. Although the valley passes along the edge of the Kohala Forest Reserve, much of the land here is private property, so straying from the trails is not recommended unless prior permission has been obtained. Visitors should not enter gardens or primitive buildings that look like they are abandoned. Although there is no electricity, water or phone service in the region, local farmers still tend to taro fields here. Besides hiking, there are several other ways to experience the wonders of Waipi'o Valley. The Waipio Valley Horseback Riding Tour is a two-hour guided ride that journeys deep into the valley. Big Island Helicopter Tours brings visitors to the remote area by air. And Mule Drawn Wagon Tours are also available. To get to Waipi'o Valley and its trailhead, take State Route 19 north away from Hilo. After passing through Honokaa town, where local food and lodgings can be found, turn right onto State Route 240, also known as Waipio Road. It will dead end at the Waipio Valley Lookout. Limited parking is available."

Moreover, the site is planning to expand its garden sanctuary to over 30,000 species in the years ahead, making it one of the world's top botanical destinations. The Gardens are located on 300 acres of former sugarcane fields. One of the most splendid natural features here is triple-tiered Umauma Falls, which was previously concealed from view. Since its development as a sightseeing attraction, however, it has been acclaimed by many as Hawaii's most beautiful waterfall. The waters of Umauma fall 300 feet in total, cascading in three separate drops into tranquil gathering pools, looking much like great lava stone steps. The pools are beautifully surrounded by tropical plants and trees. During flood season, however, the rush of water turns the falls into an almost steady river-like current, so it is best to visit between rainy periods. Umauma Falls can be reached by car directly from the entrance to the World Botanical Gardens. The road begins just across the street from the main ticket booth. It can be somewhat bumpy as the road passes by marked native trees. At its end, there is a small parking lot adjacent to the lookout for the falls. Beyond the parking lot, the road is paved, leading to yet another small parking lot. Across the road from here is an asphalt walkway that curves through magnificent tropical vegetation, including flowering torch ginger and bird of paradise. This area is especially photogenic, so visitors are advised to bring plenty of film - and also some insect repellent to ward of the mosquitoes that thrive here. A number of other water features can be seen along the rainforest walk through the World Botanical Gardens, including Umauma River and a cascading brook that borders the trail. Kamaee Falls is also quite popular, a single gushing torrent that drops several dozen feet into a pristine pool. Back near the ticket booth, other walkways lead into the foliage, where such tropical fruit trees as mango, guava, papaya, banana, and breadfruit are clearly marked. There is also a patch of corn that has been made into a maze for children to explore - the largest of its kind on the Big Island. Scenic stops along the walkways yield 360-degree vistas and sweeping ocean views, as the trails lead 1.5 miles up the slope of the extinct Mauna Kea volcano to the west. There is an 80-meter-long wall covered with wild orchids by the hundreds, and the Gardens' colorful Rainbow Walk'' includes 100 species of Bromeliads. An arboretum has recently been opened, and there are plans to add a zip line for a bit of extra adventure, too. The World Botanical Gardens are open daily from 9am to 5:30pm.

Visitors can tour through and under the canopy of the rainforest trees without harming the natural environment. These are guided tours with experienced, certified and informed local guides. In the process all guests are taught to steer so they can control their direction and prevent spinning. In addition to this, the guides will slow the riders' descent to provide a smooth landing on the ground. As well as getting fabulous views and the thrill of the ride on the zip lines, guests can also take in some of the other attractions here. Most notably they can visit the Botanical Gardens and Waterfalls. Another feature here is the world's second largest herbaceous maze."
