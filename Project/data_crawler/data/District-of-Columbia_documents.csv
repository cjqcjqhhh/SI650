The football stadium is located in Landover, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and it seats 91,704 fans. Most stadiums are owned by companies or cities, but FedEx Field is owed by Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Redskins and the chairman of the board of Six Flags. Because the stadium is so large and located in a place that otherwise does not get a lot of traffic, there is an extra exit on the infamous Capital Beltway, and this exit is typically only open when there is an event at the stadium. It is also just a short walk from public transportation stations, which many fans find to be the better option since parking near the stadium can be expensive. Before being located at FedEx Field, the Washington Redskins played home games at the Robert. F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which was located in Washington, D.C.

Roughly a dozen quirky bars with their distinct themes, ambiences and music have been one of the features most attracting visitors. The clubs of the H Street (Atlas District), Washington are known for their live entertainment which ranges from go-go dancers at Rose's Dream, rock bands at the Rock and Roll Hotel (and others) to jazz. Unique performances are those of the sword swallowing bartenders at the Palace of Wonders which adorns itself in memorabilia related to its theme of side show oddities.

"Library of Congress","District-of-Columbia","Library of Congress - District of Columbia - Historic Federal Library Is Alive with Knowledge and Arts on Capitol Hill","The Library of Congress is the largest library in the world. It is also the oldest cultural institution maintained by the United States Government. As implied by its name, the Library is a dependency of the legislative branch of the federal government. Thousands of staff people work full time to maintain the collection of over 138 million books, manuscripts, maps and recordings in 470 languages that are housed in the library. They also work to carry out other functions in compliance with the different missions of each of the facilities' 7 main divisions that are mentioned below as well as other offices. The main divisions are: 1)the Congressional Research Office, which fulfills hundreds of thousands of research missions for Congress annually and provides more than a thousand written reports each year; 2) the Copyright Office, which registers and maintains creative copyrights for all territories within the national borders; 3) the Law Library, which provides easy access to Congress and the public to over 3 million volumes of law pertaining to nearly every existing jurisdiction in the world as well as from different time periods; 4) Library Services, which not only maintains, catalogues and provides access to the existing collection but also seeks to improve its quality and quantity while promoting American creativity; 5) the Office of Strategic Initiatives which directs planning and integrated follow up within the Library of Congress; 6) The Office of the Librarian which sets policy and is responsible for administration including Development, Public Affairs and Legal Counsel; and, 7) The Enabling Infrastructure that includes the Finance Office, Human Resources, etc. The Librarian of Congress and the Chief Operating Officer oversee the functioning of the library and sit on the Executive Committee of the Library of Congress, together with Chief Officers of other divisions listed above. The Library was first opened in 1800 within the Capitol Building. It was created in the same Act of Congress that moved the Capitol to Washington D.C.  The initial collection was burned when the British set fire to the Capitol in 1814. Shortly afterwards, Thomas Jefferson offered his collection of 6,487 books as a replacement. When the Library of Congress moved into its own Italian Renaissance- style building in 1897, the Thomas Jefferson Building (1st St. S.E., between Independence Ave. and East Capitol St.), it was considered the largest and safest library in the world. Today it fills three Capitol Hill Buildings in all. The buildings are: the original Jefferson building of 1897; the John Adams Building (2nd Street S.E., between Independence Ave. and East Capitol St.), which opened in 1938 and was named after the second President who signed the 1800 bill to create the library; and, the James Madison Memorial Building (101 Independence Ave. S.E.), named after the author or the Bill of Rights, which was completed in 1981. More than 50 American artists have painted and sculpted the decorations that are found adorning the interiors of these buildings. Public tours of the Library occur several times a day. Concerts, films, art exhibitions and lectures are also frequently scheduled within the majestically carved and adorned halls of the Library of Congress. The Jefferson and Madison Buildings offer spaces that are available for private event rental."
"Lincoln Memorial","District-of-Columbia","Lincoln Memorial - Washington D.C. - A Giant Monument to the 16th President Sits on the National Mall","The Lincoln Memorial is found at the west end of the Reflecting Pool that stretches across the National Mall in West Potomac Park on the southern end of downtown Washington D.C. On passing through the two front columns into the building one comes face to face with the gargantuan image of the 16th President staring down from his seat. This President, Abraham Lincoln, is credited for ending slavery with the Emancipation Proclamation after the bloody civil war threatened to permanently split the Union in two. Henry Bacon modeled the structure on ancient Greek architectural style. The building itself is 190 feet long, nearly 100 feet high and 119 feet wide. It is constructed from Colorado Yule Marble and Indiana Limestone. The northern and southern halls of the monument, (which is maintained by the National Parks Service), contain carvings of Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address and the Gettysburg Address. In the main hall sits the stoic sculpture of President Lincoln that stretching 19 feet into the air. The statue of the seated President is said to weigh 175 tons. The lifelike statue required four years of carving in order to be completed. Not long after Lincoln's death, the proposal for the Memorial was originally made. In 1867 the Lincoln Memorial Commission was appointed by Congress. However it was not until 1910 that Congress approved a 2 million dollar budget for the project in a bill signed into law in early 1911 by President Taft. In 1914 the work began. For a total cost of approximately 3 million dollars it was completed in 8 years. Since then, untold numbers of people have visited the monument, which is open from 8 AM until 11:45 PM throughout the year except on Christmas. While a series of steps climb up to the front entry, wheelchair access is available from below the building. Public restrooms are also located at this same secondary entry. The monument has been the backdrop for numerous public protests and speeches since it was built. Civil rights leaders and other Americans expressing free speech rights have sought to draw inspiration from a man who was arguably one of the nation's greatest elected leaders. In this respect it is most remembered as the site from where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his 1963 I have a dream'' speech. Aside from the two entry columns an additional 36 fluted columns stretch upward some 44 feet representing the 36 states that belonged to the Union at the time of Lincoln's assassination. While the Smithsonian Metro stop is the closest, various Metro stations are in walking distance including Faragut North and L'Enfant Plaza. The White stone building is illuminated at night, an hour when fewer tourists are about. Parking nearby is difficult at all hours of the day and at night, thus it is recommended to take the Metro."

Contemporary art work is also abundant in the Museum, such as in the section from the Armand Hammer Collection. A joint Resolution of Congress created the Gallery in 1937 as a manner of accepting Andrew W. Mellon's gift of his collection that he had began acquiring in the 20's with the intention of bestowing it to the American People. Upon his death the collection was bequeathed and his Educational and Charitable Trust provided funds for the construction of the West Building at 7th St. and Constitution Avenue, NW. Since that time, both the collection and the museum buildings have grown on the same land initially allotted for the construction of the National Gallery of Art by the U.S. Congress on the National Mall in Washington D.C. between 3rd and 7th Streets. The East Building was erected in 1978. It is home to the library, a research center and the administrative offices of the Museum as well as exhibition space.

The galleries and interactive exhibits are separated into 5 principle areas: A Notorious History of Crime, Punishment, Crime Fighting, CSI Lab and America's Most Wanted. Fact and fantasy are mixed at times.  Most displays use real criminal and crime-fighting artifacts but fictitious articles such as the Bonnie and Clyde's car used by Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway when portraying the outlaw duo in the classic 1967 film, are also in the collection. Each of the 5 general sections contains an array of exhibits displaying artifacts as well as interactive activities in the 28,000 square foot space of museum. Interactive activities include giving visitors the chance to be shackled in a wooden pillory of colonial times and have your photo taken as a prisoner, as well as testing one's skills at shooting in a wild west mock up environment or attempting to crack a safe.

The Museum is closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas. While the Museum seeks to promote the message that crime is glorified and that it opposes this glorification it is precisely the macabre artifacts and focus on criminal activity that lend it its most interesting components. The Museum, which opened in 2008, is one of several recently opened private museum's in D.C. that contrast with the long tradition of free national museums that are run by the Smithsonian and the national government. I think there's an uphill fight for a new museum opening charging that much money and presuming to attract families, said Douglas Frechtling, a tourism studies professor at George Washington University to AP.

The National Zoo is actually two distinct facilities - a public zoo of 163 acres and a 3,000 acre conservatory and research facility located in near the Shenandoah National Forest. In total, the two facilities house over 2,000 animals from 400 different species. Originally founded in 1889 by William T. Homaday, who was a taxidermist at the Smithsonian Institution, the mission of the Smithsonian Zoological Park was to conserve and preserve endangered species and educate the public about wildlife - a mission far before its time. Homaday opened a small zoological park with American bison, bears and other native animals, but eventually left Washington and the National Zoo over a clash over the zoo's design. Homaday went on to help found the Bronx Zoo, another nationally known and internationally recognized zoo. Today, the Smithsonian National Zoo is one of the most highly regarded in the world, thanks to its contributions to captive breeding and research on conservation in the wild. The Zoo attracts visitors from around the country and around the world to its Washington D.C. campus, which is free and open to the public. There are over 2,000 animals belonging to over 400 species in residence at the National Zoo. The animals live in a variety of displays, many of them naturalistic replicas of ecosystems. Amazonia, for instance, features a complete Amazonian ecosystem with a living tropical forest and an aquarium with dozens of fish species. The Cheetah Conservation Station is a grassland outdoor setting similar to the African savanna which is home to cheetahs, Grevy's zebras, gazelles and other African wildlife. Children might especially enjoy a visit to the Kids' Farm, where children can get to know domestic farm animals and even get a chance to groom some of them. The Kids' Farm includes a playground and is home to rabbits, alpaca, hogs, goats and cows. They'll also enjoy the Elephant House, which will soon be replaced by the Elephant Trails, a new exhibit that promises innovation. Other exhibits include monkeys, apes, birds, great cats and beavers.

Some of the most popular are the Guppy Gala, a family-friendly event that features food, fun and lots of activities to make the night a memorable one for all. Other annual events include the Brew at the Zoo, a beer tasting event for over-21s, Boo at the Zoo, the Zoo's annual Halloween celebration, and Zoolights, with animated holiday displays throughout the zoo.

"U.S. Capitol, Capitol Hill","District-of-Columbia","U.S. Capitol, Capitol Hill - Washington, D.C. - Current Policy Making and its History Can be Seen in a Visit to the Historic Halls of Congress","The U.S. Capitol, Capitol Hill is the home of the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States of America. The Capitol Building is at the center of the complex of buildings that include the six main congressional office buildings and the three buildings that house the Library of Congress. Millions of people annually visit the building not only to lobby their Senators and Congressional representatives but to see the impressive architecture and artwork on display within the 175,170 square feet of ground covered by the sprawling structure. Greek and Roman architecture combine in the design of the building which has been renovated on several occasions since construction. It was built between 1793 and 1829. The location for the building, 88 feet above the level of the Potomac River, was selected by the French architect Pierre L'Enfant at the center of the city grid he was charged with designing for the federation of States in 1791. L' Enfant did not design the building. In 1800 Congress moved its permanent location to the U.S. Capitol, Capitol Hill, although construction of the building was incomplete. In 1814 the British set fire to the structure still under construction. The building is 288 feet high, more than 750 feet long and 350 feet wide at its widest section. There are 540 rooms in all. The building has five floors in all. Beneath the building runs a hub of activity that include the mail room, a series of administrative offices as well as a walkway and tram that shuttles Members of Congress and staffers from one side of the Hill to the other, avoiding the cold of the winter months when traveling between congressional office buildings and the Capitol Building. The ground level is principally filled by rooms used by Congressional Officers and committee rooms. Visitors may see the Old Supreme Court Chamber, and the stunningly ornate decorations of the Brumidi Corridors on this floor as well as the historical exhibits in the Crypt that is located underneath the Rotunda. On the second floor the Chambers of both the Senate and the House of Representatives are located as well as offices of the leadership of both bodies that make up the legislature. The visitor attractions focus on the circular Rotunda here, which is filled with art work telling the story of the nation's history. The ceiling rises more than 180 feet high in this vast space. To the south of the Rotunda is a hall of statues commemorating citizens that have played important roles in history. The old Senate Chamber is also on this floor and serves as a species of museum exhibit. The Senate has not met there since 1859. From the third floor visitors can enter the galleries above both Chambers of Congress. Offices, press rooms and committee meeting rooms are also here. The fourth floor houses other offices and administrative support areas. Several Metro Stations are located right at Capitol Hill making it easy for visitors to arrive here.

"Verizon Center, Washington D.C","District-of-Columbia","Verizon Center, Washington D.C","Verizon is a top name in cellular phones, so it is no wonder they have purchased naming rights for an arena. The arena is called the Verizon Center and it is in Washington D.C. Locals have nicknamed the arena the Phone Booth because of the phone relationship. Verizon Center Arena opened its doors in 1997. Since then the Washington Capitals and Wizards have called the facility home. The Capitals are an NHL team and the Wizards are NBA. In 1998 the Washington Mystics WNBA team joined the arena. By 2001 the Washington Power NLL team joined the arena calling it home. Unfortunately this lasted until 2002. The owner and operator of the arena is the Washington Sports Entertainment company. The construction costs were $260 million, which is no surprise since the facility has state of the art electronics as well as plenty of seating for the DC area. Basketball games can hold up to 20,100 and ice hockey tops out at 18,277 seats. The Verizon Center replaced the older US Air Arena. The older arena was unable to sustain the growing need for more seats and needed a huge renovation. It was decided a new arena would be the best option. The location is in China Town. In 2007 a mild renovation was done to the Verizon Center Arena. A new scoreboard with LED lights was added. The Verizon Center located in the United States Capital has certainly seen some notable events over the years. In 1998 the Stanley Cup Finals came to the center. Also the Champions on Ice, Ringling Brothers Circus, Van Halen, WCW, NCAA Men's basketball tournaments, WWE, Janet Jackson, and Britney Spears events have been at the facility. A WNBA All Star Tournament, Mike Tyson versus Kevin McBride, Madonna, Paul McCartney, Shakira, Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez with Marc Anthony, and AC/ DC are other notable events. Michelle Obama hosted a Kid's Inaugural event in 2009 once she and her husband gained the White House. Also the center has enjoyed events like Tina Turner, Fleetwood Mac, Eric Clapton, The Jonas Brothers, Sarah Brightman, Metallica, and Kiss. Coming in 2009 and 2010 will be AC/ DC on a comeback tour, Miley Cyrus, and the WWE Survivor Series. Bruce Springsteen, The Wiggles, and Trans-Siberian Orchestra are a few of the other tours coming to the Verizon Center. Entertainment is not the only thing the Verizon Center Arena can offer. To keep people happy during events there are plenty of concessions. A few places to eat include Dunkin Donuts, the Greene Turtle Sports Bar, and Noah's Pretzels. For shopping needs the Verizon Center offers Fan Gear. It has many of the team's jerseys and sports memorabilia guests may want to have. It can be found on the main level on F Street.

"Washington Dulles International Airport - Washington DC Dulles International Airport Flight","District-of-Columbia","Washington Dulles International Airport - Washington DC Dulles International Airport Flight","Less that 50 years old, the Washington Dulles International Airport is one of the D.C. area's three main airports. Dedicated by John F. Kennedy in 1962, it was named for John Foster Dulles, a former US Secretary of State. The airport currently handles more than 24 million passengers annually and more than 1,000 flights daily, making it the busiest of the D.C. airports. Dulles was one of the first airports built specifically to handle jets . . and more! The airport was actually engineered to have the capability to serve as a future spaceport, but the future hasn't quite caught up with the dreams of the past. Nevertheless, the extra long runways and tough construction have made the airport well-suited for international flights and super-jumbos. Another unique feature of the airport is the mobile lounges. Essentially giant rooms on wheels, they move people to the planes instead of having traditional jet bridges. Travelers may want to be sure to ride on one soon, as they didn't catch on and Chrysler is planning to discontinue them. Dulles will then go to the jet bridge and moving walkway system used at the rest of the airports around the country. Shuttle service between Washington Dulles International Airport and Reagan International is available, although those making transfers should be aware that in traffic it can take more than an hour to get between the two airports. It can also be a long haul to get into the heart of downtown, so business travelers will want to be mindful of the thick D.C. rush hour traffic when scheduling meetings. The 5A Metro Bus offers service to the airport, but is currently the only mass transit option available for getting to the airport. Otherwise, most travelers carpool, drive or cab it to the airport. Most hotels offer a shuttle service, and there are Super Shuttle services available throughout the D.C. area with services to Dulles."

"Washington Monument","District-of-Columbia","Washington Monument - District of Columbia - World's Tallest Masonry Structure Celebrates First President of the U.S","Standing on the National Mall in Washington D.C. at Constitution Avenue and 15th Street SW on the north side of the Reflecting Pool, the Washington Monument is over 555 feet tall. The towering structure's walls are 15 feet thick at the base but dwindle to 18 inches of thickness at the uppermost section. The walls are made from white marble and rest on a granite base with iron beams for support. The building weighs around 90,854 tons. The foundation goes down more than 36 feet into the ground below the structure. Visitors can ride an elevator to the top of the structure to the observation level where windows allow for a panoramic view of the nation's capital city. The ascent in elevator is said to take 70 seconds. Interior walls along the stairs are lined with 192 carvings donated by nations, states, organizations and individuals as gifts. Climbing the 897 stairs is no longer permitted. The fastest recorded ascent of the stairs however, was 6.7 minutes; this record was set in 2005. The Washington Monument was built to honor the nation's first President and Revolutionary War General, George Washington. Construction occurred between 1848 and 1884. Practically speaking, almost no work occurred between 1856 and 1876 due to the Civil War and insufficient funds. The giant obelisk was inaugurated in early 1885 although it was not until 1888 that it opened its doors to the public. The original design included a series of pillars at the base, statues of each of the founding fathers and a towering statue of Washington with a structure resembling the monument that stands today at the center. The monument is the tallest masonry structure built to date on the Earth. When it was first erected it was the tallest structure but that title was quickly taken away with the completion of the Eifel Tower in France. From 1996 to 2000 the monument was restored at a cost of some $5 million in private donations. The building is usually open from 9AM to 4:45 PM. Tickets are free for same day visits at the kiosk at 15th Street and Jefferson Dr., just down the slope from the Washington Monument. The kiosk is open from 8:30 AM until 4:30 PM. Tickets are available on a first come first serve basis. They can also be purchased in advance. The monument is run by the National Parks Service and it is open 364 days a year, closing only on Christmas Day. The Smithsonian Metro station is the closest Metrorail stop to the monument; however various other stops are also in easy walking distance. As parking is very restricted and parking garages are costly in the downtown area of this city it is highly recommended to use the Metro and public bus system to visit the monument and other downtown sites in the District of Columbia."
"Washington National Cathedral","District-of-Columbia","Washington National Cathedral - District of Columbia - Faith Based Monument Welcomes Worshipers of All Denominations in Capitol if U.S","In 1893 President Benjamin Harrison signed the charter that Congress had approved for the Protestant Episcopal Foundation of the District of Columbia to establish a cathedral and educational institutions. Three years later, land on Mount Saint Alban was acquired by the first Bishop of Washington. In 1907 construction began. Even while only partial constructed, services with a national focus began to occur at the cathedral. In 1918 Woodrow Wilson attended the thanksgiving service here for the end of WWI. It was also here that the State Funeral for President Eisenhower occurred in 1969. It was not until 1990, after 83 years, that construction was completed. The Washington National Cathedral was primarily built out of Indiana Limestone. For construction, limestone blocks were laid upon each other with layers of mortar between the blocks. Flying buttresses of stone brace the walls while a steel beam construction supports the roof but is not structurally integrated into the rest of the building. The building fills 83,012 square feet and weighs 150,000 tons. The central tower is just over 300 feet tall and the building is just less than 458 feet long on the inside. The Cathedral has an open door policy for worship services and on the evening of the final Tuesday of every month invites those interested to walk its labyrinth, an elaborate floor pattern, for contemplative prayer, a tradition that dates back for Christians to the 4th Century in Algeria. A regular series of lectures and discussions are held by the Washington National Cathedral, often focused on discussing socially relevant issues from a faith perspective. More than 60% of the cathedrals lectures, educational programs as well as its ministries come from individual donations. The Cathedral is located at 3101 Wisconsin Avenue NW and provides free parking for those attending worship services in its underground garage beneath the building from 6 AM until 11 pm on Sundays. The Cathedral sells a variety of items in its store that range from the spiritual to the ordinary as part of its ongoing efforts to fund its programs and services. For a small fee a variety of tours of the Cathedral and its grounds are offered. Tours include a self guided and audio tour about stained glass and gargoyles at the cathedral. Guided tours require reservations in advance and they center on a range of topics including the architecture of the building itself, patriots and statesmen depicted in artwork at the Washington National Cathedral, Behind the Scenes Views of the Cathedral and a tour of the Gardens. There are also periodic exhibits organized in the Rare Book Library room and the Crypt as well musical recitals and concerts. The Tenleytown/American University Metro station on the Red Line is only a mile and a half from the cathedral. One can walk from there or board the 31, 32, 36 or 37 bus heading southward. Other city buses may be faster to get to the Cathedral from areas of town far from the Red Line."

It is open from 7:30 AM to 4 PM seven days a week closing only for Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Years Day. The cornerstone for this building was put in place by President Herbert Hoover on July 10, 1929. When the construction was finished three years later it was the largest office building on Earth at the time. It is run by the National Parks Service which is responsible for all of the Historic Landmark Parks and monuments in the downtown Washington area such as the National Mall and the Presidents Park (which includes Lafayette Park, the Ellipse and the White House grounds). The facility first opened in 1995 in order to give interpretative information about the White House to visitors and to provide tickets for White House Tours. While the Visitors Center no longer provides tickets for tours, it does contain exhibits that give insight into some of the behind the scenes events that have occurred at the seat of U.S. presidential power over the years.  The six permanent exhibits cover aspects related to the Executive Mansion and the history of its inhabitants, the First Families In the White House, Symbols and Images, White House Architecture, White House Interiors, the Working White House, and Ceremonies and Celebration. A thirty minute video on the White House is also shown at the Visitors Center. The video is closed captioned for people with hearing impediments. There is a small store managed by the White House Historical Association. A visit to the White House Visitors Center (newly expanded) is recommended by the White House to people that have arranged to tour the Executive residence as it gives background information that will help inform a self-guided White House Tour. Unlike a stop at the Visitors Center that requires no reservation, a Tour of the White House requires advance notice through a letter to one's Congressional Representative at least 5 days in prior to the planned visit. Wheelchairs are made available upon request for a maximum of a 2 hour periodfree-of-charge although roughly one hour is sufficient time to see all of the exhibits.

As there is no immediate parking it is highly recommended that visitors to this area take public transportation or a taxi.
