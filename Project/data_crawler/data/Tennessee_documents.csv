"Alum Cave Trail","Tennessee","Alum Cave Trail, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN - Park","One of the best places in the eastern United States to go hiking is in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. From the Park, you can see a lot of beautiful mountain scenery and lush vegetation everywhere. The Alum Cave Trail is one of the most well-known trails offering hikers a challenge - and some great views. The Alum Cave Trail leads to the top of Mt. LeConte which is the third highest mountain in the Park, with a height of 6,593 feet. The Trail itself is 5.5 miles to the top, or 11 miles roundtrip. On the way, there are some excellent spots for sightseeing - or turning around - if you only want to go part of the way. The Trail can be rather strenuous in places. On average there is a height gain of about 500 feet per mile, and a total gain of about 2,700 feet by the time the peak is reached. At various places on the trail, there are hand rails available - where they are needed most. It certainly is not the only trail that leads to the peak, but many believe it to easily be the shortest and most scenic route. If the ground is wet from a recent rain, you may want to consider hiking the Trail when the ground is dry. The Trail is very rocky and the rocks can be slippery and somewhat dangerous when wet. While on the hike, the first notable landmark that the hiker comes to is the Arch Rock. This feature will be 1.3 miles from the starting point, the trailhead. It is a naturally formed rock arch. There are stairs inside and cables to help hikers get through it. The next feature to be seen on this Trail is called Inspiration Point. From there, you can get a good view of the Little Duck Hawk Ridge. A little beyond the Point, the hiker can see the Eye of the Needle, which is a natural hole in the rock at the top of the Little Duck Hawk Ridge. Then you will come to the Alum Cave Bluff. This is the feature that the trail is named for, and it will be at 2.2 miles. Alum Cave is not really a cave, but is simply a large overhang that forms a rock shelter. The opening is about 80 feet high and about 500 feet wide. By the time this point is reached, the hiker will be at about 4, 950 feet. Alum, epsom salt, saltpeter, magnesia and copperas were mined from this cave at one time - some of it during the Civil War. If you are hiking in the cold months of the year, you certainly want to watch for falling icicles from the top of this Cave - they could be fatal. The next feature, which marks the half-way point to the top, is a large flat rock called Gracie's Pulpit. This was named after a lady who lived on the mountain had hiked the trail to LeConte on the 92nd birthday - which she had also done many times previously. When you get to the top of LeConte, you will see the LeConte Lodge. You can find some items for sale here, such as T-shirts, souvenirs, and other things that hikers would enjoy. You can also buy limited food here, but if you want a hot meal you will need to call at least 48 hours in advance. The Lodge also provides a number of cabins that you can stay in overnight - if you have a reservation. These have one room, or two and three bedroom cabins. There is no running water or electricity in the cabins, which will give you a real rustic stay away from all modern conveniences. This could be a great way to spend a night with a great view at the top, when you take the Alum Cave Trail in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN."
"Amazing Mirror Maze","Tennessee","Amazing Mirror Maze, Gatlinburg, TN - Amusement","A new feature in Gatlinburg is the Ripley's Amazing Mirror Maze.

The Amazing Mirror Maze claims to be the world's largest maze. There are more than 2,000 square feet of maze space for people to get lost in - and then find their way out again. It is all mirrors and they can really be tricky. Of course, the maze has its usual share of dead ends, circles and corners, and many mirrors give the apparent hallways an infinite look about them.

"American Museum of Science and Energy","Tennessee","American Museum of Science and Energy, Oak Ridge, TN","Science and energy tend to be fascinating subjects, and in 1949 the American Museum of Science and Energy was formed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The museum was originally called the American Museum of Atomic Energy. It was a place that explained the science behind atomic energy, as well as to show the peaceful uses of that type of energy. The museum was located in an old wartime cafeteria. Eventually, interest in science and energy required a new facility to be built. It opened in 1975. Three years later the museum was renamed the American Museum of Science and Energy or AMSE for short. The museum is open daily, except for major holidays. Operation hours are Monday through Saturday 9am to 5pm, and Sunday 1 to 5pm. Admission prices are $5 for adults, $3 for children 6 to 17, and $4 for seniors.

"Athena and Parthenon Replica in Nashville","Tennessee","Athena and Parthenon Replica in Nashville, TN, the Athens of The South","Why is there an Athena and Parthenon replica in Nashville, TN? Long before Nashville, Tennessee, gained fame as Music City USA, and was considered the world capital of country music it was actually called the Athens of the South. This phrase was coined because Nashville, TN had become an undisputed pioneer in education and culture in the southern United States. Thus for the 1897 Centennial celebration of the City, it should come as little surprise that a full scale replica of the Greek Parthenon was constructed While other structures constructed for the city Centennial anniversary were later removed, this wood, brick and plaster structure was spared, as it had quickly won the hearts of the proud inhabitants of the growing city and in 1902 the surrounding land was converted into the City-owned Centennial Park. In the 1920`s the deteriorating structure of the Parthenon replica, which had only been built to house an art exhibit at the 1897 celebration, was rebuilt in concrete. This process is said to have taken some 11 years, ending in 1931. The new permanent structure was designed in collaboration between local architect Russell E. Hart and an archaeologist and architect from New York, William Dinsmoor. The latter studied the original ruins in Greece as part of developing the plan for the inside of the Parthenon replica which is considered to be faithful to the original temple. The largest bronze doors in the world guard entry to the structure on the east and west sides. Despite the reconstruction, the building was still not strong enough to stand more than a few decades thus in 1988, the building, which had continued to serve as an art museum, benefited from a major restoration that had a budget of 2 million dollars, re-opening with modernized gallery space, a gift shop and basement administrative offices. It was only after this renovation that the Tennessee Athena statue was unveiled at the museum. The replica took Nashville artist Alan Le Quire 8 years to fashion, one year less the 9 years that the Greek sculptor Pheidas needed to create the original work in the year 438 B.C.  Le Quire's Athena in is 41 feet and 10 inches tall, thus winning the title of largest indoor statue in the western world While the original Athena was sculpted of gold and ivory, the Athena replica was crafted from gypsum cement and ground fiberglass, while her head was built on a frame of aluminum with a steel lowed section that sits on a concrete base which reaches into the Parthenon replica's basement to find support in the natural bedrock below. In 2002, the statue was gilded with gold plates and detailed painting was added by Le Quire, the original artist. Daughter of Zeus, a large cult is said to have existed for Athena in Greece, thus making the Athena and Parthenon replica in Nashville, TN among the latest in a long line of tributes. It is a bit of Ancient Greece in modern, Nashville. An appropriate monument to a Goddess identified with wisdom and culture in a city that continues to boast numerous higher education institutions and a vibrant culture that centers on country music and jazz."

The park got its name from the Big Hill Pond that was constructed in 1853. Dirt was taken from a borrow pit to build a levee across the Tuscumbia River and the Cypress Creek bottom. This enabled the Memphis to Charleston Railroad to run trains in the area. Since it was first built many cypress trees have filled in the area around the thirty five acre pond. Visitors can reach the pond by using a four wheel drive vehicle. There are many trails throughout the park that can be used by mountain bikers and horseback riders. Since they both use the same trails caution and consideration should be used by both parties. A boat ramp has been built at Big Hill Pond State Park.

Bass boats that are as large as twenty feet can use the boat ramp as long as the vehicle towing them can climb the boat ramp. Boats can only use electric motors. There are shelters for campers within the park. There are four shelters altogether with three of them being very remote. Backcountry camping isn't allowed so campers must stay in one of the shelters. Staying at the shelters is on a first come basis. Campers need to check in with a ranger about which shelter they will be occupying or leave a note on the dash of the car. This allows the rangers to know why the vehicle is parked overnight. Campers also need to tell a ranger how long they will be camping.

"Bristol Caverns","Tennessee","Bristol Caverns, Bristol, TN","Paved, well lit walkways greet visitors when they take the Bristol Caverns tour. Bristol Caverns is in Bristol, Tennessee. The state is filled with amazing caves, with Bristol as just one of the many visitors might want to visit. Vaulted chambers where ancient underground rivers formed the various caverns inside the place can be dated to 200 to 400 million years ago. During the frontier days the Native Americans used the underground river to attack or escape when they had raids on the settlers. Visitors to the Bristol Caverns can follow these paths exploring the various rooms, arches, columns, and natural stone creations that exist. Many veins of minerals are displayed in the cavern walls that offer bright colors of blue, grey, brown, white, and red.

Some of the formations have grown together with those from the ceiling reaching those growing from the floors. Each area will provide a view that is made up of natural artistry. Visitors will look upon the structures as tumbling cascades or billowing draperies even though the features are all solid stone. As one of the oldest caverns in Tennessee thousands of visitors come to Bristol Caverns each year.

"Burgess Falls State Park","Tennessee","Burgess Falls State Park, Sparta, TN","Tennessee, by area, is not a very wide state; however, it does have a fairly long length. In the middle of this vast state is the Burgess Falls State Park. The park is on the eastern edge of the Highland Rim, which is next to the Cumberland Plateau. Sheer bluffs, rolling water, mixed forest, and narrow ridges make up the characteristics of the state park. As part of the Burgess Falls State Park is the reason for its name, the waterfalls. One such place is the Falling Water River, which actually drops about 250 feet along the way. In the park are 300 species of trees and plants, as well as some wildlife. Adjacent to the upper parking lot is the Native Butterfly Garden. Park hours are 8am until 30 minutes before sundown. To reach the park visitors can come on Interstate 40 or from Highway 135. Historically the park can be traced back in time for three centuries. In the past the Cherokee, Creek, and Chickasaw tribes shared the region for hunting. Then white settlers moved into the area from Europe. The first of these individuals was Thomas Burgess. He is also part of the reason for the state park name. He was granted land in 1793 as payment for his part in the Revolutionary war. In the late 19th century a gristmill and sawmill were added to the town using the river for operation. A number of logging and farming communities sprung up. For energy the Falling Water River was used. In 1973 the area became protected by the State. To see the original historical sites one can take the River Trail. Hiking is part of the recreational activities available at Burgess Falls State Park. There is a 1.5 mile river trail loop that takes visitors past four waterfalls. The water falls cascade 20 feet, 30 feet, 80 feet, and 136 feet to sea level. They are called the cascades, upper falls, middle falls, and lower falls. There is also a 1 mile Ridge Top Trail with scenic views of the main canyon that Falling Water River runs through. All trails are moderate to difficult. Bikes and horses are not permitted. Other recreation at the park includes boating. Boats are not allowed below the dam, and only fishing boats are allowed in the shallow lake above the dam. There is no boat ramp so lake boating is not really an option. Only trolling motors are allowed on the lake. Fishing is available year round with bass, brim, and carp as the possible options. There are popular fishing holes in the lake, below the dam, and below the main falls. These areas tend to produce more fish. The waters from Center Hill Lake go to the base of Burgess Falls. Any fisherman must be 13 years or older with a valid Tennessee license. Camping is not available at Burgess Falls State Park, but there are picnic tables and plenty of natural areas to enjoy on the hikes."
"Cannonsburgh Pioneer Village","Tennessee","Cannonsburgh Pioneer Village, Murfreesboro, TN - Attraction","If you like to learn about how life was in the past, and are passing through the Murfreesboro, TN area, then Cannonsburgh Pioneer Village is the perfect place for you and your family. This Village is sure to provide fun, education, and a great way to see life as it once was in this part of the country. The Village is set to show what it was like between the 1830's and the 1930's. Cannonsburgh was the original name for Murfreesboro, but the name only lasted for 30 days. It was then changed by request to honor a friend, Col. Hardy Murfree. This recreated Village of old days was built in 1976 when there was some competition on a national scale to fund and build projects in honor of the Bicentennial. It is in the general location of the original town. There are many historic shops and other buildings in the Village. This includes a grist mill, a museum, a general store, a blacksmith's shop, a doctor's office, a train caboose, and more. A one-room school house is also there, a town hall, and so is a Wedding chapel. The blacksmith shop is operational, and you can watch blacksmiths work the iron in the old-fashioned way. The grist mill is also operational. Art classes are available, providing groups and family members with both interesting and educational experiences. All of the buildings in the Village were brought there from other places in the county. They have been restored. Even the bridge into Cannonsburgh was salvaged from another place and brought here. It was the first steel bridge in the county. The Village has also started a collection of farm antiques. Among them, there are several early farm tractors on display, including a 1900 Birdsell Clover Huller, which is in excellent shape. Several of the tractors still run, too, out of the 23 that are there, now. There is also an antique steam engine, and collectible items can also be purchased. The wedding chapel is a hot place for young couples seeking to get hitched. It is air-conditioned (and heated in winter), has stained glass windows, an antique pump organ, and decorations. Couples must arrange for other things they will need, including catering. An unusual item that is in the Village is the World's Largest Cedar Bucket. It was built in 1887 and was displayed at two World Fairs - Chicago (1893) and St. Louis (1904). A fire had damaged it in 2005, but this bucket, which is about six feet tall, can be viewed by visitors. The Village is only open during the warmer months of the year, from May 1 through December 1. During that time, tours are given for a small fee, or visitors are free to walk around on their own. The grounds are open all year. Stores are closed on Monday, open from 10 AM to 5 PM Tuesday through Saturday, and then open on Sunday from 1 to 5 PM. Groups can also meet here for their special events or meetings. The whole Cannonsburgh Pioneer Village in Murfreesboro, TN can be rented for your great event."
"Carnton","Tennessee","Carnton, Franklin, TN - Museum","One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War took place in Franklin, TN. The Battle of Franklin is also known as the Gettysburg of the West, and there were more than 10,000 casualties on both sides in a mere five hours. One of the large plantation type homes nearby, called Carnton became the largest hospital for the wounded. This plantation was owned by the McGavock family, and they quickly helped the wounded and dying soldiers. More than 300 soldiers were brought there for care, and there were soldiers lying around everywhere - in the house, in the slave quarters, and all over the grounds. Over 150 soldiers died there on the first night. Mrs. Carrie McGavock helped in every way she could, along with her two young children. One of the children's bedrooms became the surgery room. The blood from those terrible days still mars the floors in places in the home. Mrs. McGavock became known as The Widow of the South, and a best-selling book by that name written by Robert Hicks is about her and Carnton. At the time, Carnton had about 1,400 acres. Although the McGavocks did use slaves, they had moved them to Georgia because the area had come under Union control. At that time, farming took place on about a third of the property. Although Carnton was not the only home used as a field hospital (many were), it certainly was the largest. Later, the McGavock family donated two acres of land near the house to be used as a Confederate cemetery. Almost 1,500 soldiers were buried there. It is the largest Confederate graveyard that is privately owned. Today, visitors to Carnton can also visit the cemetery, which has been maintained by the United Daughters of the Confederacy since 1905. The beautiful antebellum Carnton Plantation house has been fully restored just recently. Visitors can see where the McGavocks lived and touch this historic place that saved the lives of many who felt the care and touch of Carrie McGavock. Visitors can also see the slave quarters, a smokehouse, and the springhouse. There is also a restored Italianate garden. The Confederate cemetery is also there. Tours of the property are available, too. A Gift Shop sells books about the Battle of Franklin and about the Carnton Plantation. Special events also take place from time to time on the property. There are living history re-enactors during special days, and they give various demonstrations and talks. This includes demonstrations of artillery, Civil War medicine, storytelling and more. Concerts are given in the summer. A special Christmas Open House takes place each year. A new Visitor's Center has also been opened - one that cost $1.2 million. It includes the gift Shop, the exhibit hall, and the room for special events. Student groups and schools are also invited, and there are some special programs for Scout groups, too. Special meetings, or weddings, can also be held at Carnton in Franklin, TN. They can host meetings of different sizes - up to 500 people - depending on where you would like them - in the event center, the Garden, or on the Patio. Equipment can be rented to meet your needs."
"Carter House","Tennessee","Carter House, Franklin, TN - Museum","If you are in the central Tennessee area, near Franklin, and love Civil War history, you will certainly not want to pass the opportunity to see the Carter House. This brick structure saw one of the fiercest battles ever fought in the Civil War, and is considered by many to be the turning point in the War. In the Fall of 1864, General Hood had just been put in by President Jefferson Davis to replace the injured commander, Joseph E. Johnston. His commission was to drive out the Federal forces, especially Sherman, away from Atlanta and General Lee. The Federal forces already had command in the Franklin area, and now had decided to stay and confront General Hood. The Federals had 22,000 infantry and 13,500 cavalry, and they quickly set up headquarters in the Carter House. The family, and some neighbors stayed in the basement during the fierce battle. Coming at them, the Confederate army had 20,850 infantry and 5,000 cavalry. General Hood very strongly believed in frontal assaults and he could not be dissuaded otherwise by his generals. The battle of Franklin was probably the bloodiest battle in the Civil War, apart from Gettysburg. Often referred to as the the bloodiest hours of the American Civil War, it was also considered to be the Gettysburg of the West, as their Web site proclaims. Many Confederates almost got to the house, but were bayoneted or clubbed to death before they could get inside. The Battle only lasted five hours, from 4 PM until 9 PM, on November 30, 1864. During those hours, however, many men lost their lives. Out of the Federal army, there were more than 2,500 casualties; and of the Confederates, there were more than 7,000 casualties. Only one general of the Union army was injured, but on the Confederate side, 15 out of 28 generals were lost. On the next morning, when the Confederates went on to the property, they discovered that the Union army had left. They were moving north toward Nashville to join the forces already there. Today, the Carter House and nearby property has become a Museum dedicated to the many thousands who lost their lives there. One of the buildings, the Carter House Farm Office, is the most battle-scarred building still standing from that war. There are more than 1,000 bullet holes in the structure. Just after the war, land for a cemetery was donated to by the McGavock Family in 1866. There were more than 1,480 soldiers of the Confederate army buried there. Tours are given every day of the Carter House and grounds, but it is closed on holidays. This includes a video that reveals information about the battle. There is also a Museum with artifacts from the Battle of Franklin. The Tour includes visiting the eight acres of the battlefield, the Abbey Leix Mansion, and the Carter House. There is a Gift Shop. Special days also take place on the grounds during the year. On the Anniversary of the Battle, for instance, they have Re-enactors come in and reenact the Battle for a couple of days. There are also people there who will be giving Living History demonstrations, too. A special ceremony also takes place to commemorate those who died there, and the tombstones will also be illuminated."
"Casey Jones Village","Tennessee","Casey Jones Village, Jackson, TN - Museum","When traveling between Memphis and Nashville, TN, you can find a lot of activities for the whole family at the Casey Jones Village in Jackson, TN. This village, which celebrates one of most well-known trainmen of all time, has plenty of activities for all. The main attraction for which the Village is named is the historic home of Casey Jones and the Railroad Museum. Casey Jones had lived for some time in Jackson and was working with the railroad when he came to town. His house was later moved to the present location and then opened to the public on the 81st anniversary of his death. The Railroad Museum has a new large addition that includes a lot of railroad artifacts from the life of Casey Jones. The Station is recreated after the look of an authentic 1890's train station.

"Cedar Creek Sports Center","Tennessee","Cedar Creek Sports Center, Mount Juliet, TN","About seventeen years ago the Cedar Creek Sports Center was opened for residents in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The location of the center makes it close to a number of cities in the middle of the state like Donelson, Hermitage, and Lebanon. The center can be reached from Interstate 40. There is one goal in mind for creating the Cedar Creek Sports Center, and that is fun. It is a family fun park for everyone. Whether visitors enjoy mini golf, go karts, or bumper boats it is all available at the Cedar Creek Sports Center. The Putt- Putt Golf or miniature golf option provides visitors with two 18-hole golf courses. Every hole on the course will be challenging, but fair. Children and adults of all ages will have a great time on the courses. Some of the holes are simple with little blocks in the path to the hole, while others will take into account the water challenges offered. For example there is a huge waterfall that goes into a lake that visitors have to walk over to get to the next hole. Individual and family/ group pricing is available to make it affordable for all. For visitors who want to practice their skills for professional golf there is a driving range. The driving range is 12 acres with distance markers and on range'' targets to aim for. Large Bermuda grass tees are offered. The driving range is open and lit for night time practice. Cedar Creek Sports Center has 3 and 10 bucket tickets. Go karts and rookie go kart tracks provide a lot of fun for the entire family. The go karts are Indy style with two seats, so that children can ride with mom or dad around the adult track. The younger drivers who reach height requirements can take out the rookie karts on a separate track. After a bit of fun going around the track, visitors can take advantage of the Baseball and Softball batting cages. There are ten pitching machines with 4 speeds for the baseballs. Beginners to skilled batters can test their skills. Softball machines have a slow pitch to start and will work up to an advanced fast pitch for the more experienced. Team rentals are available for an hour and by appointment only. A new kind of fun was added to the Cedar Creek Sports Center recently. The Wet n' Wild Bumper Boats are shockwave electric bumper boats with power and a quiet motor. The entire family can get splashed as teams pair up to beat the other riders on who gets the most wet.'' The boats have a driver controlled water squirter to ensure that all get as wet as possible. Anyone with a birthday can book the sports center for the ultimate party.

"Cherohala Skyway","Tennessee","Cherohala Skyway - Robbinsville NC - The Mile High Skyway","The Cherohala Skyway is a scenic highway running from Robbinsville North Carolina to Tellico Plains Tennessee. The 36-mile long stretch of road winds through stunning scenery and 5,400 foot high mountain ranges, and offers spectacular views on all sides. The highway was completed in 1996 after nearly 34 years of construction, costing in the region of $100,000,000 to build. With 21 miles running through Tennessee and 15 miles in North Carolina, there are plenty of spectacular mountain-top and forest views to behold. It crosses through both Cherokee and Nantahala National Forests, lending to its name of Chero...hala''. Be prepared when you're traveling though, particularly in the winter months. Being so high it can be a cold and desolate place in winter, and even in the summer months it's worth being prepared for all possible weather conditions. But, the sheer experience of driving along the mile high skyway and its impressive views more than makes up for its occasional bad weather. The temperature can change by as much as 10 degrees from the lower elevations to the top, and many people simply drive up to cool off in the summer. Its long corners and scenic views are making the Skyway famous amongst the motorcycling scene and sports car set; in fact almost anyone will be able to appreciate the views and natural beauty that surround it. Indeed, you're highly unlikely to see much in the way of civilization in the surrounding area, so you really are in the centre of nature. It's also wise to make sure you have enough gas before you set off on your journey - the only facilities along the whole 36 miles are restrooms, so don't expect to drive by a gas station any time soon. The idea of the Skyway was first thought up in 1958 when Sam Williams, spurred on by his love of Wild West movies of the time, imagined his very own wagon train'' from his home in Tennessee all the way to North Carolina. What he thought was a pipe dream quickly turned into a reality, and planning and construction of the highway began in late 1962. 34 years and 100 million dollars later, the Cherohala Skyway was open for business. It's North Carolina's most expensive highway project ever, and today up to 10 cars and 50 motorcycles use the route each day. A far cry from the original estimate of 10 cars every minute! Starting in Robbinsville and Santeelah Gap in North Carolina, the highway quickly ascends up to Santeelah and its highest overlook point of 5,390 feet. A further 7 miles of twisting roads and stunning scenes leads to the Tennessee state line, and at mile 16 the descent into Tellico River Basin begins, before finally ending up in Tellico Plains for some well earned refreshment and refueling. Around the Skyway there are a variety of vacation areas available where you can enjoy the scenery for longer, from lakes and mountain springs to forests and national parks. Try and travel in the fall if you can, when you'll really be able to appreciate the views in all their glory."
"Cherokee National Forest","Tennessee","Cherokee National Forest, Townsend, TN - Forest","The Cherokee National Forest, which starts at Townsend, TN, is a large forest area that covers much of eastern Tennessee and parts of North Carolina. It extends from the northern border of Tennessee at Kentucky, and then down to Georgia. One county of North Carolina (Ashe) also contains a few acres. The Forest is divided into two sections, and each section comes up to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. One is called Cherokee National Forest South, and the other is called Cherokee National Forest North. Although the Cherokee is much larger, it is not as well known as the Park. Both, however, offer many opportunities for family fun in the great outdoors. The Cherokee National Forest was designated such by President Roosevelt in 1939. Large sections of the land had been stripped of minerals and trees through logging and mining, but it was Roosevelt's goal to restore the land to its natural beauty. The Cherokee Indians had lived in the area previously. The Forest, which is the only one in Tennessee, and which is also the largest tract of land in the state, consists of over 640,000 acres. Most of the forest has been recovered, and it now flows with wildlife and much rich vegetation and trees, making it the perfect place for many different activities. When it comes to fun in the Forest, there is a wide range of things you can do - either by yourself, with friends, or as a family. For one thing, there is a lot of beautiful scenery that can be seen by going on the various trails. Altogether, there are more than 600 trails that are for non-motorists, and this includes the Appalachian Trail and the John Muir Recreation trail. These allow you to go on bike, horse, or on foot, and generally they are for each. Other designated trails can be used for motorized vehicles such as motorcycles and ATV's. Plenty of other activities are available, too. One of the region's most famous activities is whitewater rafting or canoeing. There are rapids through the area, and plenty of places to put in a kayak, too. Possibly the best in the east is the Ocoee Whitewater Center where the 1996 Olympics whitewater events were held. You can also go swimming and boating on the rivers and lakes in the region. Fishing and hunting are also allowed. Other activities that are a favorite of many are rock rappelling at Tennessee Overhill, llama trekking, several shooting ranges, and more. Some ranches in the area also provide opportunities for outings that can help your business or group build better teams through their adventure packages. If you just want to view some of the wildlife, this is the place. There are more diverse forms of wildlife than any where else in North America. Altogether, in the Cherokee National Forest, there are more than 260 species of birds, 140 species of fish, 70 mammal species, and plenty more when it comes to the reptiles and amphibians. Some of the most beautiful sights in eastern Tennessee can be seen around the Tennessee Valley Authority Watauga Reservoir and the Wilbur Reservoir. RV camping and tent camping spots are also available at different places throughout the Cherokee National Forest near Townsend, TN. Also, there are some traces here and there throughout the Forest where there is still evidence of the mining and logging that took place more than 70 years earlier."
"Children's Museum of Oak Ridge","Tennessee","Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, Oak Ridge, TN","Tennessee communities are interested in educating both children and adults. For this purpose there are a number of museums and educational facilities in the state. One location is the Children's Museum of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This museum is structured for interactive learning for children. It is located in the eastern section of Tennessee, but it is easy for all residents of Tennessee and surrounding states to get to. The Children's Museum of Oak Ridge has many play centers for children to discover, solve problems, experience different things, and to interact with the exhibits. It is a different style museum that makes it more fun for children. In adult museums children are not allowed to touch the various displays. Here at the Children's Museum the idea is to interact with everything and with others. Arts, science, and history are all about of the museum. It opened in 1973 as a Girl Scout project. It was originally opened at the Jefferson Junior High School at the library. Later it was moved to an elementary school, before the museum got its own building. In 1983 54,000 square feet of building was built for the Children's Museum. Hours of operation at the museum are Tuesday through Friday 9am to 5pm all year. Saturday hours are 10am to 4pm, and Sunday is 1pm to 4pm. From June to August the museum is open on Mondays from 9am to 5pm. Admission fees are $7 for adults, $6 for seniors and $5 for children three and up. School tours have a discount of $1 if unguided making admission $4 for school groups. The museum houses a variety of exhibits beginning with the Rainforest. The rainforest is a simulated Amazon experience with sound effects, a waterfall, walkway, murals, and observation deck above the canopy. Trees, flowers, and wild animals are all fake but part of the exhibit to show what it would be like. There is a field station that guests begin at to learn about the rainforest. Another exhibit is the model trains. The museum has the World of Trains'' which is a collection of models donated by Milton Lloyd. He was a prominent citizen in Knoxville and the model train railroaders. The trains have a hands on play room with a mock up of a diesel engine and HO scale. Other sections have a club room, caboose, and garden railroad. The Appalachian Mountains and culture living in those mountains is very important to Tennessee. Children are able to visit the Appalachian Heritage display with a recreated homestead. Artifacts from the 1850's to the 1880's are on display. The Knoxville 1910's exhibit shows city and country life during that time. The International Hall offers a place for children to learn about different countries such as music from Africa or Japanese Kokeshi dolls. The Children's Museum also has Waterworks, the Bird Room, the Dollhouse, and a nature walk. The Arctic, Native American exhibit, Life in the 30's, and much more is on display for children to learn from."

The hours of the actual stores may vary and should be contacted individually to confirm them. The College Square Mall which is the only mall for eight counties in the East Tennessee area opened during 1998.

Belk took part of the space that Wal-Mart occupied which had both a mall and outside entrance when the store was moved to the outside of the mall. The Dixie Pottery opened adjacent to Belk but did not have a mall entrance and closed during 2007. The Proffitt's was replaced by Kohl's when the building was expanded. The Carmike Cinema which has twelve screens was built during 2008 and the original theater torn down. During 2009 Goody's Family Clothing chain filed bankruptcy and the store in the College Square Mall closed. The College Square Mall offers a number of amenities to make the experience of patrons as enjoyable as possible.

"Cumberland Caverns","Tennessee","Cumberland Caverns, McMinnville, TN","Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee is one of the many cavern systems in the state. Tennessee is well known for their caverns. Cumberland Caves has some of the largest underground rooms in the eastern United States. The caverns were recently open for tours year round. The tours include educational tours, overnight spelunking trips, adventure tours, group tours, and banquets. Cumberland Caverns is located off of Interstate 24 and Highway 55. Tickets are $10 for children between six and twelve, and adult prices are $15. Cumberland Caverns started out as part of the Higgenbotham Cave and Henshaw Cave, but after careful exploration it was decided that the cave system was so vast and large that the two caves were linked, thus making it Cumberland Caves. There are more than 32 miles as part of the cave system. Aaron Higgenbotham discovered the first portion of the cave in 1810. He was trapped on a ledge for three days because his torch when out. Shortly after the Civil War it was found that a 60 foot wide and 10 foot high room that is 2000 feet long existed in this cave. It is called the Ten Acre Room.'' In 1812 the Henshaw Cave was mined for Nitrates that would be used for the war of 1812 and later in the Civil War. The National Speleological Society began to explore both caves in 1945, eventually starting a new entrance in 1950. By 1956 the cave system was opened up for the first visitor. Still, it has been only recently that they are open past the popular tourist months of summer. Visitors to Cumberland Caverns will be taken to the largest underground rooms that are part of the cave system. Stalagmites and stalactites have grown from floor to ceiling, meeting each other to create huge columns. Some of the saltpeter can still be seen in the walls, though a lot of it was removed during the mining. The daily walking tours take visitors to the God of the Mountain,'' Bone room, Volcano room, Ten Acre room, Meat Grinder, Oasis, or the Endless Waterfall. Not all rooms are given on the same tour, as the area contains 27 miles. A day trip will take visitors to a certain section of the tour area that is a half mile. Individuals get to see the gleaming pools of water and waterfall. Inside the Cumberland Caverns it is 56 degrees, constantly. The Spelunking Adventure Trips will take groups of 10 to 250 people through the caves. Individuals are allowed to crawl, climb, and go through muddy areas to explore the cave. The ladders and ledges in the cave can be reached while on the tour. The unusual sites of the cave are part of the tour. For the night the group will bunk down at 500 feet. Educational tours are designed for students who want to learn about geology, history, and wildlife of the caverns. The tour provides lunch in one of the larger rooms with the three- quarter ton chandelier in the Volcano room."

"Jack Daniels Distillery","Tennessee","Jack Daniels Distillery, Lynchburg, TN","The Jack Daniels Distillery is the oldest registered distillery in the United States. It was licensed in 1866. The whiskey that Jack Daniels first produced was Old No. 7 and he made it with pure spring water from an iron free cave water source. Jack Daniels left his family when he was very young and lived with a family friend named Dan Call. Mr. Call was an ordained Lutheran minister. He just happened to also possess a whiskey still. When Jack was only thirteen years of age in 1863 Mr. Call sold the still to Jack. This spring that helped Jack Daniels produce his fine whiskey is still producing eight hundred gallons of pure water a minute. The temperature of the water is fifty six degrees. Right outside the cave where the water comes from is a statue of Jack Daniels. Besides being the oldest distillery it is also registered as a National Historic Site. One of the attractions by the Jack Daniels Distillery is Miss Mary Bobo's. Miss Mary started her place as a hotel for travelers in 1867. Mr. Jack Daniels visited the place frequently for a midday meal. She ran her boarding house until her death in 1983. She was nearly 102 when she died. Miss Mary Bobo's Boarding House Restaurant still serves midday meals to visitors of the distillery. One of the stories that has been circulated about Old No. 7 is that it was the seventh recipe batch of whiskey that Jack Daniels tried and it proved to be successful. Jack Daniels died in 1911of blood poisoning. The story of how he got the infection begins with him kicking his safe in frustration because he had forgotten the combination. He broke his toe and got an infection which led to the blood poisoning. He is buried in the Lynchburg cemetery. One of Jack Daniels ideas to promote his two saloons, the White Rabbit and the Red Dog was to create a band. He did this in 1892 when he formed the Silver Coronet Band. They performed in Lynchburg Square as well as the campaigns of presidential candidate William Jennings Bryant and a Tennessee Governor candidate Robert Taylor. Jack Daniels bought all of the instruments for the thirteen members of the band. They played together until World War I broke out. Jack Daniels hosts some events including the World Championship Invitational Barbeque. The distillery has a racing car; they are well known at the Sturgis, South Dakota Rally and Races, too. There are many products for sale that have Jack Daniels name associated with it. Some of the products that can be found in grocery stores are Old No. 7 BBQ Sauce, Original Steak Sauce and Mesquite EZ Marinade. Alcoholic beverages that are available are Jack Daniels Country Cocktails. There are also recipes like Lynchburg Lemonade that use Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey. Visitors to the distillery or online can find grilling tools, accessories and recipes. Although Jack Daniels has been gone for years his recipes live on."

"Laurel Falls","Tennessee","Laurel Falls, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN - Park","Throughout the beautiful Great Smoky Mountains National Park, there are many different things for the whole family to see, including a large number of waterfalls. One of the best of these, however, is called Laurel Falls. The scenery is almost unbelievably gorgeous in the Smokies, and this is because of the rain that the top of the mountains receive each year. While the rainfall near Gatlinburg is about 57 inches per year, the tops of the mountains near there can receive up to as many as 83. This means that there is a constant watering going on, providing a constant supply of water in the streams and enabling a lush plant growth all summer long. Waterfalls are abundant, but Laurel Falls is especially pretty. Out of all of the falls in the area, this one is certainly one of the most popular. The falls themselves are about 80 feet high, and the water tumbles over many rocks on the way down, providing a great scene for taking pictures. Getting to the falls will mean a hike of about 1.3 miles. The trail is paved and rather level. Strollers can be taken on the trail easily. The only problems may come after you have walked about a mile. At that point, the trail starts to descend toward the Laurel Fork Gorge which is at the base of the Falls. The descent really is not bad, it is a drop of about 300 feet. Once at the falls, you and the family can have a lot of fun. You can eat a lunch and enjoy the view, go wading or swimming, or just get some great pictures - or all of the above. If you want to see the falls when they have the most water going over them, you will certainly want to come during the spring or fall - particularly after there has been some rain in the few days earlier. If you still want to do some hiking, you can go on the trail beyond the falls. The trail beyond the falls is not paved, but it is clearly marked. Just continue taking the Laurel Falls Trail and you will come to the Little Greenbriar Trail. Until you come to the Greenbriar Trail, it is a slow but steady climb. The last part of the Greenbriar Trail will bring you to Cove Mountain after about a mile. When you intersect with the Cove Mtn. Trail it will lead you to the Visitor's Center at Sugarland. Another place to go from the falls is to follow the trails to Bryan Overlook. This could prove to be a little more difficult walk, possibly even much more difficult, but it is not far away. It will be about 1.3 miles round trip, but would be well worth the trip. If you really enjoy seeing waterfalls, there are many other ones in the area. In fact, nearly every stream has waterfalls somewhere along their course. Once you have visited Laurel Falls in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN, be sure to get a map and stop by some of the other ones. Some of them, such as the Meigs Falls and the Place of a Thousand Drips can be seen from the road, and the best time to see them is after there has been some rain."
"Lost Sea Adventure","Tennessee","Lost Sea Adventure, Sweetwater, TN","The world does not offer too many underground lakes, at least that are open for tours. Visitors in Sweetwater, Tennessee can have an amazing adventure at the Lost Sea Adventure. Visitors will arrive at an 18th century village with huge caverns and an underground lake awaiting them.

Visitors are advised to bring a camera and to be prepared for an awesome adventure. Wild Cave Tours are available for families as well as organizations.

It is a three- quarter mile walk along sloping pathways until the tour reaches the underground lake. Geological developments, interesting formations, and multiple cavern rooms are on the way. At the bottom visitors will board a glass bottom boat. The lake is four acres in size. The U.S. Department of Interior has registered the lake as a National Natural Landmark. The lake is not the only reason for this distinction. It is also due to the abundance of anthodites or cave flowers that litter the walls. Cave flowers are thin structures of minerals that look a lot like white sparkling flowers. The lake is situated at 140 feet below the ground level. The tour is an hour and fifteen minutes in length. The temperature throughout the cave is 58 degrees, which is quite comfortable for the hike in shorts and a tee shirt. Above it was mentioned that there is a Wild Cave Tour for organizations. This tour differs from the public tour. Anyone who participates can crawl into the undeveloped cave rooms to look at cracks, crevices, nooks, and more. While in these areas visitors have to watch out for the cave flowers. In fact Lost Sea has 50 percent of the world's cave flowers. Archeologists have found remains of an ancient jaguar that used the cavern. Moonshine was mined in the cave during prohibition. Also, saltpeter was mined for gunpowder during the Civil War by Confederate soldiers. The Wild Cave Tour begins at 6:30pm EST. All groups must check in at 5pm if supper is part of the tour. The tour is an overnight excursion throughout the cavern, and must include plenty of chaperones to maintain safety. Rules and regulations must be followed for this tour. Groups can include up to 12 participants. These tours will require equipment such as flashlights, drinking water, and something to sleep on. Breakfast is offered in the morning once visitors come out of the cave. Old Sweetwater Village takes visitors back in the past before or after they enter the cavern. A general store, ice cream parlor, gem mine, and glassblower are all in the village. There is also the cafe, Cavern Kitchen, for sandwiches and barbeque."

"Mabry Hazen House","Tennessee","Mabry Hazen House, Knoxville, TN - Museum","The Mabry Hazen House in Knoxville, TN, offers some valuable history about the Civil War. It is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The beautiful home contains many original artifacts from the period that will appeal to most people. The home sits on top of five acres on a place called Mabry Hill. A cemetery is also located there called Bethel Cemetery and contains mostly Confederate soldiers. The house itself was built in 1858 - just three years before the start of the Civil War. This two-floor, wood frame house is primarily Italianate in design, but also has some Grecian influence. The home was occupied only by three generations of the same family - from 1865 to 1987. The owner of the house was a strong supporter of the Confederate cause, and he was one of the wealthier men in the Knoxville area at the time. By himself, he had outfitted an entire company of Confederate soldiers, at a cost of about $100,000. In the first half of the Civil War, the Mabry-Hazen house served as the headquarters for the Confederates in the area. In the second half of the War, the Union soldiers used it as their headquarters. Today, the home still has the original furniture and furnishings. Visitors can take a tour through the home and see the fine china, the silverware, crystal, and more. It is one of the largest collections of original artifacts in America. Throughout the year, there are several special activities that take place on the grounds. On special days, celebrations or tours are given, such as the Historic Homes Tour, the TN Statehood Day, the Summer Solstice Picnic, and more. There is a Victorian Tea given annually at the home every spring, and a tour of the home goes with it. Another large event is called Boomsday. This is a time of big celebration. On that day, there will be live bluegrass music, barbeque, and more. A premiere fireworks display will also be given. The Mabry Hazen home will be open after 6 PM for tours, and dinner is served at 7:30 PM. The event will be limited to 300 people to avoid overcrowding and to keep it a quality event. Another great event takes place around Christmas. The house is decorated in plenty of Christmas decorations and lights. Light refreshments will be served. Bethel Cemetery is the name of the Cemetery that takes up four acres of the property. More than 1,600 Confederate soldiers were buried here during the War, and 300 of them were killed during the battle that took place at Fort Sanders. Later, 50 Union soldiers were buried there, and an additional 20 veterans from the Civil War. The Cemetery was donated to the Hazen Historical Museum Foundation in 1989.

This particular natural reserve is located in Burns, Tennessee as part of the Cumberland area in the middle of the state. Montgomery Bell State Park land was particularly valuable in the early 1800's due to iron ore. Iron ore drew settlers to the area, which is why there are still remnants of old buildings in the park.

Visitors to the park will see signs of old buildings and equipment like the Old Laurel Furnace, Ore Pits, and much more.

"Mount LeConte","Tennessee","Mount LeConte, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN - Park","One of the most well-known mountains in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is Mount LeConte. It is the third-highest mountain in the state of Tennessee and it is very popular with hikers because of its easy proximity to Gatlinburg, TN, where you can find the entrance to the Park. The mountain itself actually has four peaks on it that are above the 6,000 foot level. The mountain is generally referred to as the LeConte massif - which means the main mass of the mountain. The four peaks are called High Top (6,593 ft.), Cliff Tops (6,555 ft.), West Point (6,344 ft.), and Myrtle Point (6,200 ft.). Because of the height of Mount LeConte, the scenery from the top is incredible. Several features on the way to the top are well worth seeing. The shortest trail, which is also considered by some to be the most scenic, is the Alum Cave Trail. This Trail is 5.5 miles to the top, and a round trip of 11 miles. On the way, you can see points of interest like the Arch Rock, the Alum Cave, which is more of an overhang than a real cave, Inspiration Point, and the Eye of the Needle, which is a naturally carved hole in the top of a nearby ridge. Other trails will also lead to the top and each one has unique features. The Boulevard Trail is about 5.4 miles long. If you like to hike in solitude, the Bullhead Trail is the one you want, and it is about 6.9 miles long. The Rainbow Falls Trail will take you to the Falls, which is the highest water in the Park. Finally, the Trillium Gap Trail is 8.9 miles long, and it is the trail the llamas take when bringing supplies to the Lodge. It also has the only horse trail on the mountain. The Mount LeConte Lodge near the top also provides a great way to stay overnight in a very rustic setting. This lodge is the highest place providing lodging in the entire eastern US. It has seven rough cabins that can sleep up to a total of 60 people. The cabins have one to three bedrooms and can sleep up to 13 people each.

Hiking is the only way to the top. Supplies to the Lodge have to be brought in three times a week by llamas, or by helicopter. Only the main office building of the Lodge has running water. Each cabin is provided with a bowl of water for washing, and there is no electricity. A public toilet does have running water - but no showers. The temperature on LeConte Mountain in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is such that you will need to consider preparing for it. It is comparable to that of southern Canada. Although the high temperature has on occasion reached 80 degrees, it has never been higher than that. On a summer's night, though, it is possible that it could get down into the 30's. Snow can be expected from October through May, and may be as deep as 71 inches at the top."
"Museum of Appalachia","Tennessee","Museum of Appalachia, Clinton, TN","The reason that the Museum of Appalachia evens exists is because of one man, John Rice Irwin. The museum isa living mountain village that is located at 2819 Andersonville Highway, Clinton, TN 37716. The Museum of Appalachia is open year round during daylight hours, except Christmas Day. Because of the seasons the closing time will vary so guests are advised to call for exact hours. The beginning of the museum started with a discarded spice grater that John Rice Irwin's granny used. He felt that it was necessary to preserve the history of the people of Appalachia. Their way of life and the items they used in daily life would represent great historical value to the many people that would visit. He began going to auctions, farms and places where he could purchase articles that would eventually go into the living museum. His first purchase was of an old horseshoeing box. It had been retrieved from the Clinch River which had flooded a half century earlier. Because of John Rice Irwin's admiration for the hardy people of Appalachia and their ingenuity and craftsmanship, the museum was brought to light. The Museum of Appalachia has been written about in many publications throughout the years. Reader's Digest states that it is the little touches of humanity that give this museum a living quality. An axe stuck in a tree stump, firewood stacked neatly against the house, dresses hangingon a wall peg and the utensils in the kitchen ready for use make visitors think that the residents have just stepped out and will be back soon. Tickets to the museum can be purchased on site or online. The price for adults 13-64 is $14.95, AAA discount is $12.00, Senior Citizens 65+ are $12.00, children 6-12 are $5.00 and children under six are free with a parent. If there are twenty people or more the price is only twelve dollars per person. There are different rates for the festivals that occur throughout the year. Some of the festivals that happen at the Museum of Appalachia are the Folk Art Festival, Mountain Music Festival, Tennessee Fall Homecoming, July 4th and Anvil Shoot and Christmas in Appalachia. Visitors to the museum can also see the gardens, collections and the restaurant. Student Heritage Day is very popular with the school children. Some of the activities that they can participate in include pottery making, doing chores the old fashioned way, attending a singing school, guitar workshops and clogging lessons.

"N.C. & St. L. Depot and Railroad Museum","Tennessee","N.C. & St. L. Depot and Railroad Museum, Jackson, TN - Museum","When you are passing through the Jackson, TN area, a great place to stop is the N.C. & St. L. Depot and Railroad Museum. This train was historically responsible for the building up of the area and had some powerful influence during the war, too. The Nashville, Chattanooga, and St. Louis Railway Depot (N.C. & St. L. Depot), which was originally built in 1907, served to bring people into the area for the many activities and attractions taking place at Lancaster Park. This Park attracted people from miles around who came to see the amazingly beautiful gardens, watch the games at the baseball park, play at the fairgrounds, and go to the mineral wells. The Depot, which is a brick structure, has been restored to its original beauty. Inside, you will find many artifacts and pictures that show what kind of great impact the train had in the development and growth of Jackson, TN. Altogether, there have been 14 different trains that helped build the area, and the museum stands as a tribute to all of them. The one thing that really stands out on the Museum's baggage room is the large model train that actually runs. It is an HO scale train on an 11' X 20' foot layout that uses authentic models of the trains that ran through Jackson between 1950 and 1971. The buildings and scenes are actually models and scenes from the past in Jackson. Although it was originally built in 1995 by volunteers, it had to be rebuilt by Scouts after a tornado had caused a lot of damage in 2003. There are more than 500 feet of track and as many as four trains can operate at the same time. The train layout has 40 different can you find items. Three historic railroad cars are also on the property that visitors can go through. There is a dining car (1947) and two different kinds of red cabooses. The dining car can also be rented for birthday parties or similar events. Games can be played in the Depot, they can watch the model train run, and then have cake and ice cream in the dining car. A goodie bag will be given to each child. A tour through the Museum and cars is also available. It takes you through the various exhibits and you will need about forty-five minutes to an hour to go through all of it. Groups are also welcome, but if there are more than ten people, they would appreciate a call first. Another regularly scheduled activity is the Watch & Timepiece Show. This event is for all ages. Many people show their watches and other timepieces and you are invited to do the same. You can buy, sell, or trade your timepiece, or just get it appraised. It runs between 10 to 12 AM on the first Saturday of the month. When you have finished visiting the N.C. & St. L. Depot and Railroad Museum, there are other attractions around that are also worth seeing. One of them would have to be the Casey Jones Village, where you can find shopping and history at the same place."

"National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN Celebrates Civil Rights Movement","Tennessee","National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN Celebrates Civil Rights Movement","The National Civil Rights Museum located in Memphis Tennessee is one of the main attractions in this historic city. The museum was able to purchase the Lorraine Hotel, where Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated, and turn it into a world class museum and memorial to Dr. King. In 1982 the Lorraine Hotel had been neglected since Dr. King's assassination. The motel was put up for auction and purchased by The Martin Luther King Memorial Foundation for $144,000 dollars. Much of this money was raised through the fundraising efforts of the Martin Luther King Memorial Foundation as well as through private sponsorship. The Museum completed a major upgrade in September of 2002. They added nearly thirteen thousand square feet of exhibition space. This new space has allowed the Museum to include highlights of civil rights triumphs from around the globe. The museum is in a central location of Memphis Tennessee. There are a multitude of first class restaurants, art venues, and plenty of live music clubs within easy driving distance of the National Civil Rights Museum. Memphis is home to nearly 700,000 people and is the largest city in Tennessee. There are a variety of things to do in Memphis, but the main tourist attraction occurs in the spring and is known as Memphis in May. Memphis in May is dominated by four main attractions which are; The Beale St. Music Festival, The World Championship Barbequing Contest, The Sunset Symphony, and International Week. In addition to these headline acts of Memphis in May there are many other smaller attractions. According to USA Today the average home price in Memphis is down nearly 15% from 2007 to $128,000 dollars. Experts believe that Memphis is well suited to ride out the slow real estate market, however, because the city did not overbuild as many did during the housing boom. The 663,700 people that make up the labor force in Memphis, Tennessee earn a mean salary of $36,870 dollars per year according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Due to the fact Memphis is located on the Mississippi River and close to the Atlantic coastline the transportation industry is one of the largest employers in the city. In fact FedEx corporate headquarters are located not too far from the National Civil Rights Museum's front door. Crime in Memphis is a growing concern in the community. According to a report issued by Michael J. Heidingsfield, President of the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission, the FBI released statistics showing that the Memphis Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had the highest violent crime rate per 100,000 residents in the United States in 2006. The report does indicate that there may be some confusion here due to the reliability of crime reporting statistics nation wide.

"Smoky Mountain River Rat","Tennessee","Smoky Mountain River Rat, Townsend, TN - Rafting","One place that you do not want to miss when you are looking for fun in the Smokies is the Smoky Mountain River Rat in Townsend, TN. This place has proven to be a popular spot on hot days allowing guests to have a fun way to stay cool while relaxing on the river. Most everyone knows what tubing is, and here is a great place to do it. The river ranges from calm to somewhat rough in spots, giving visitors some excitement as they float downriver. The float trip takes about one and a half hours. Guests can get either a float or a kayak. Once at the bottom of the destination, which is at a swinging bridge, a shuttle bus is waiting to take guests back up to the starting place. Once here, you can either call it a day - or go again. Picnic spots are also available at both ends of the route. This allows you to relax and eat and enjoy the beautiful scenery around the river. Of course, if you don't carry your food with you, you will have to go back and get it. Children over the age of five years old are allowed to have their own raft, but they will also need to be accompanied by an adult. To add safety for them, some tubes also have bottoms, so that the children cannot accidentally fall out. All guests are supplied with lifejackets, but they are optional for people over 13. There are two different routes that you can take. One, called the Family Float, goes downriver from the River Rat building and lasts about one and a half hours. Anyone above two years old can go on this ride. The other one, called Adventure Float, lasts about one hour. Floaters on this ride will need to be above five years old, and they will be taken upriver by shuttle and then float down to the building. On occasion, if the weather has been dry for a while, the river may be too low to go rafting. Just to make sure, you may want to call in advance to ensure that the water level is high enough. Group rates are available for tubing groups. The larger the group, the better rates they will get. Kayakers, however, are not eligible for group rates. Also, those that want to go for a second or third trip down the river get to do so at about a third the regular rate. Fees include the shuttle ride, the tube or kayak, and a life jacket. The Smoky Mountain River Rat also owns another place called USA Raft. Between the two of them, you are sure to find rafts, tubes, or kayaks for a day of leisure on the river. When you go river rafting or tubing, you may also want to take in some of the other many activities or sights in the area.

"Stones River National Battlefield","Tennessee","Stones River National Battlefield, Murfreesboro, TN - Battlefield","One of the worst battles of the Civil War took place not far from Nashville. Both sides fought extremely bravely because both sides knew that it would probably be a turning point in the War. The central part of the state of Tennessee was at stake, and you can see what happened at the Stones River National Battlefield. In the Battle of the Stones River, there were more than 81,000 men involved. The Confederate forces were strong and had already controlled central Tennessee, from where they were getting their supplies. They wanted to take Nashville and cut off many supplies that were constantly strengthening the Union armies. The Army of Tennessee (Confederate) had pushed the Union Army back to the Stones River after a couple of days of battle. The very fierce battle took place over three days - from December 31, 1862 to January 2, 1863. Prior to falling back to the River, both sides had suffered tremendous casualties. At the Stones River, the Union Army saw it as a last stand in order to keep Nashville under their control. A loss here would mean a tremendous victory for the Confederates - if they were not stopped here. With some reinforcements, the cannons were set up on the Nashville side of Stones River - waiting for the Confederates to attack - which they soon did. At that time, many Confederates lost their lives as they charged the Union position. Fortress Rosecrans was quickly built there afterwards to ensure the region for the Union side. The Confederate Army retreated, allowing the Union side to take over central Tennessee. Altogether, there were about 24,000 casualties, which was about one-third of the forces involved. At the Stones River National Battlefield, you will find that 600 acres of the actual battlefield have been preserved. The Stones River National Cemetery can also be visited. There are 7,123 headstones, and more than 6,100 of them are Union Soldiers. More than 2,500 of them, however, are unknown and may also contain more than one set of remains - possibly a family member of the soldier. More than 2,000 Confederate soldiers were buried at the Evergreen Cemetery. There is a large Visitor's Center which is free, just like the Battlefield. Here you can see a museum, a movie about the battle, and a gift shop. The Center is open every day except Christmas from 8 AM to 5 PM. Teachers can also find a lot of support material at the Battlefield's Website. These can be used in the classroom, such as a trunk or guest speaker, or the classroom can be brought to the Battlefield. The Park has a number of activities on special days for families and Scouts. One of them is the Be A Junior Ranger, and also there are activities to help Scouts earn badges. There are many talks, tours, and presentations through the year, as well as living history demonstrations, and Civil War weapons demonstrations. In the summer months at the Stones River National Battlefield in Murfreesboro, TN, park rangers offer guided tours. These occur on a regular basis and are caravan tours.

"Sunsphere Tower","Tennessee","Sunsphere Tower, Knoxville, TN - Building","The horizon of Knoxville, TN is clearly spotted by a unique building that stands out - especially when the sun's rays hit it at just the right angle. The reflection off of the gold glass can easily be seen from a long way off. The Sunsphere Tower has come to be the symbol of the City. The Sunsphere was built for the 1982 World's Fair when it was held in Knoxville. It was the very first spherical building ever built in the United States. The tower stands 266-feet tall, and is easily tall enough to be able to see much of the city of Knoxville from its Observation Decks. The sphere itself is 75-feet in diameter. Originally, it was planned to be 86.5 feet, because of the sun's diameter of 865,000 miles. The theme for the World's Fair that year was on Energy Turns the World. The base that supports the globe is hexagonal. The sphere gets its gold color from a coating of 24-carat gold dust on the seven different shapes of glass. The unique design of the Sunsphere meant that it quickly caught the attention of several engineering magazines at the time and they had feature articles about it. During the World's Fair, it cost just two dollars to ride the elevators up to the top. There was a restaurant up there at the time and visitors could buy a Sunburger, and a cocktail made of rum and a fruit juice. Altogether, there are three floors for restaurants in the Sunsphere, and two observation decks. The Sunsphere and the amphitheater are the only two original building's that remain from the Worlds' Fair. From the Sunsphere, visitors can get a beautiful 360-degree view of the city. Since the Fair, the Sunsphere has largely been unused. Just a couple of events have taken place or only a few groups have rented space in it since that time. Space is now available. Several companies now have offices on the fifth through eighth floors of the sphere. The Mayor of Knoxville, Bill Haslam, determined to renovate it and open it to the public for free. Visitors can now go up in the tower for free to the observation deck and get a grand view of the city. In the observation deck, you will find a number of exhibits with pictures and videos that present some of the history of the area and of the World's Fair, too. There is a bar and lounge there, as well. Parking is also free around the park. At the present time, there is no gift shop. This means that souvenirs for the Sunsphere cannot be purchased. Being able to look over the city of Knoxville from such a unique and historic building, does offer its own special occasion to all members of the family. If you are not from the area, there are also many other fantastic places to go to that are not far away. Other hotspots would have to include Gatlinburg, Dollywood, and also the Great Smoky Mountains National Park."

There is even an illustration of how the Hermitage became known as a landmark of America. Stories of the Slave Community have been brought back to the museum. These stories were part of the museum and then given out on loan and removed for other exhibits. The displayed items are now showing information regarding slaves, skilled craftsmen, and even field hand accounts. Information regarding births, purchases, lives, selling the slaves, and those who died at the Hermitage are part of the display. Tours are available for groups. Visitors can get an account of the buildings, Jackson's life, and much more from the tour guides. The information has been written in history books and in private books, and now shared with the public. It will soon be possible to dine at the house. However, details are not yet available for 2009. The original log cabin that Andrew Jackson lived in was moved to the site of the grander plantation home. There are over three different buildings for visitors to tour. Much of the cabins remain today because they were built of brick rather than the log of the original home. The gardens are also still available for viewing by visitors, adding to the experience."
"The Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum","Tennessee","The Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum, Townsend, TN Museum","When you are in the area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, you will want to stop in and see The Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum in Townsend, TN. This small museum has a number of interesting items from the Little River Railroad that are worth seeing. Although the railroad was small, it was responsible to bring tourists into the area in the early 1900's. In addition, it moved the lumber from many thousands of trees out of the area. It operated between 1901 and 1939. The train would go from Maryville, Tennessee to Elkmont, Tennessee, and its main purpose was to carry lumber. The Little River Lumber Company started the Little River Railroad in 1901 and used it to cut lumber from both Blount and Sevier counties. Once the lumber was removed, the land was sold and became part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The track was completely removed. Today, a number of pieces of the equipment from the railroad are in the Museum - or parked outside of it. Some of these train pieces and other equipment have been restored and well taken care of. Other equipment is there for people to see. Inside the Museum building, there is both equipment and many pictures which show the history of the train and much information about the logging processes as well. Other important papers, tools, and artifacts are also included in the exhibit. The buildings used to house the museum are also historic. One of them is an old post office from the town of Elkmont. The other is the Walland Depot building, which was moved to the museum property in 1983. Sitting out on the property there are the larger exhibits. Visitors can see the Shay 2147, which is the main steam engine used on the railroad. There is also a Little Woody caboose, two flat cars, a wooden tank tower, and a log loader. Another item on the property is what is called a setoff house. This little shed-sized building was what the loggers lived in while at a logging site. The small structure was simply unloaded off the train right by the track and moved from camp to camp. When it was moved, it would be loaded on to the train with all the furniture still inside. A row of these setoff houses would be called a stringtown. Plans are to increase the number of exhibits in the Museum. They are working on receiving grant money from the government and from friends. Annual memberships can be purchased. The Little River Railroad and Lumber Company Museum in Townsend, TN is a great place to visit. The museum offers a lot of artifacts and history of the railroad from the area. The Museum is open seven days a week, but only from noon until 5:00 PM on Sunday. It is closed between November and March, but a private tour can be made by appointment. After you see the Museum and items on the property, you will want to see other things in the area. There are many places to visit in this area that is so close to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park. Not far away are Cades Cove, Dollywood, and many activities in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg."

"The Track","Tennessee","The Track, Pigeon Forge, TN - Amusement Rides","Finding a place in Pigeon Forge that offers fun and rides for all members of the family would have to bring you to a place called the Track. This place has a number of different activities that are sure to keep them interested and happy for hours - and something that they will remember for a long time. The Track is located right on route 441, which is the main road through Pigeon Forge. To start with, The Track has go-karts. The go-carts come in different types and can also be used by different age kids - young and old. This track that is used is much more complicated than a standard one. This one is wood and goes up three levels, and has overpasses, too. Go-karts come in one- and two-seater vehicles. Their Kiddie Karts can be driven by anyone that is at least 4 years old. Bumper cars are another favorite of the young ones, but there are two different kinds at The Track. You have the standard bumper cars, and then there are the bumper boats. The bumper boats, however, have an extra feature that is sure to add to the fun - a water cannon. This is great for those little battles on the water where everyone gets wet and has a lot of fun. The excitement is also there for the more daring, too. If you want to try your hand at Bungee Jumping, you can take a plunge off their 65-foot high tower.

The course is wheelchair accessible. When you want to calm down a little after the fun, you can stop in one of their two arcade game centers.

"Trenton Teapot Museum","Tennessee","Trenton Teapot Museum, Trenton, TN","Dr. Frederick C. Freed donated the collection of teapots that date from 1750 to 1860. The doctor traveled extensively internationally and collected teapots while he was away. He was born in the city of Trenton, Tennessee in 1889 and went to school in Nashville for his premed. He completed his Doctorate in Medicine in 1913 from Jefferson College in Philadelphia. He did his residency in obstetrics and gynecology in New York at Bellevue Hospital. Dr. Freed opened a practice in the city and remained there for forty years. While the doctor was on his travels he began collecting veilleuses-theieres. This is a type of nightlight teapot; not the typical teapot that brews tea. Throughout the time he collected teapots there were more than six hundred and fifty in his collection which was the largest private collection in the world. The museum was founded in Trenton, Tennessee thanks to his brother, Sylvane Freed. When the doctor was visiting him in Trenton he asked what he was going to do with his massive collection. At that time he thought he would leave them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His brother convinced him to donate them to his hometown and the museum was born. Dr. Freed's home at 304 East Eaton Street is open for public tours or meetings. The address of the Trenton Teapot Museum is at Trenton City Hall, 309 College Street, Trenton, TN 38382. There is no charge to enter the museum and it is open from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. If a large group wishes to visit they should call ahead of time. The first teapots were donated in 1955 when Dr. Freed gave the city five hundred and twenty five of them. It was over a period of several years that they were dispersed. They were first displayed in the lobby of the Peabody High School Auditorium. The teapots remained in this location until a new Municipal Building was constructed. Dr. Freed made sure a special display case was constructed to house the teapots permanently. They reside in the council chambers. More than three thousand visitors come to the Municipal Building in Trenton to view the teapot collection. Within the United States there are only two other collections that are near the same magnitude. The two collections belonged to Frances Parkinson Keyes and Harold Newman. Similar collections can be found in Europe in France, Switzerland and Italy. The earliest teapots were used as food warmers, with a bowl instead of a teapot. They used this top of veilleuses for porridge, soups or drinks for an invalid in a hospital or sick room. Because of the design of these teapots they were often used to brew tea with medicine in them for infants and for their light. They became the first nightlights because most of them were translucent. The popularity of these teapots with aristocrats in Europe produced many unique designs. Some were figurines or in the form of a person. They even had the crests or insignia of the families of distinction."
"Wahoo Zipline","Tennessee","Wahoo Zipline, Sevierville, TN - Ride","When you are in the Smokey Mountains and come to have some fun, you want to be sure to ride the Wahoo Zipline in Sevierville, TN. If you love soaring through the air, you will greatly enjoy this unique ride. Gatlinburg, Sevierville, and Pigeon Forge all offer a lot of rides and things for visitors to enjoy. None, however, offer anything like this great adventure. The Wahoo Zipline is a new ride in the area, and it was started in August of 2008. If you are not familiar with a zipline, it is basically a cable that has a pulley on it so that the rider can sail along it. Gravity is the moving force, and in this case, you could be moving along at about 40 miles per hour over the treetops! Ziplines were created by scientists and researchers who needed a way to travel among the treetops of the rainforest. A single pulley, a set of cables, and a harness soon enabled them to scramble all around the treetops with ease. It wasn't long before this system of getting around the treetops took off and became a popular activity. Now, many places have ziplines, but few are as long or as extensive as this one. This zipline lets you see some of the beauty of the Smokey's while you are sailing along on the more than two miles of the entire course. There are actually six sets of ziplines that go from one mountain top to the next... to the next... In between the towers, you will actually be a minimum of 40 feet up to 250 feet in the air hanging in space and moving up to 40 mph! Before you get out there in space moving through the trees, you will be required to listen to some safety information. All guides on the course have received specialized instruction and have been certified. You can bring along a camera to take pictures while you fly through the air, but it will need to have a strap to go around your neck or wrist so you don't drop it. Groups are also welcome at the Wahoo Zipline. Corporations and businesses can come and enjoy the fun and also use the experience to build teamwork. Other groups are also welcome and can look forward to a great time. There are some limits as to who can ride the lines, however. Anyone over 5 years old can ride, but anyone under 18 must have parental consent and one parent must be present. Riders also need to weigh less than 275 pounds. A liability waiver is required to be signed before going on the ride. Bad weather may cancel rides for that day. When you need a place to stay in the area, you will want to consider the Sterling Springs Mountain Resort. They have a luxurious cabin and a lot of great amenities for their guests. All their guests can also get a 50% discount on their tickets for the Wahoo Zipline in Sevierville, TN."
