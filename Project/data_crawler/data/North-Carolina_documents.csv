"Andrews Geyser","North-Carolina","Andrews Geyser - Old Fort, NC - Geyser Marked as the Gateway to the Blue Ridge Mountains","Located in McDowell County, Andrews Geyser is a man-made fountain that was constructed in 1885. It was constructed on land that was part of the grounds of a stylish hotel called Round Knob Lodge. The creation of the Geyser began with the damming a stream, which in turn created Mill Creek. Mill Creek was about 200 feet higher in elevation than the spot that became home to the Geyser. A pipeline was run from Mill Creek downhill to the Geyser. Gravity was then able to create the waterspout. At times, conditions were optimal enough for the Geyser to shoot water 250 feet into the air every 2-3 minutes. The Geyser was known nationally by the 1890s. In 1903, Round Knob Lodge burned down, and the Geyser fell into disrepair. George Fisher Baker, a New York banker, began restoring the Geyser in 1910. He wound up having to relocate the Geyser to the other side of Mill Creek. Baker then named the Geyser in honor of Colonel Alexander Boyd Andrews. A native of North Carolina, Colonel Alexander Boyd Andrews was the Vice President of the Southern Railway Company. In the late 1800s, a railroad was constructed between Old Fort and Asheville, and Andrews was one of the individuals responsible for the construction. Andrews Geyser marked the gateway to the Blue Ridge Mountains, and was built adjacent to the tracks of the Southern Railway. The Geyser was visible from the train as it traveled across the mountain. After Baker restored the Geyser, Southern Railway maintained it for as long as the trains passed through the area. As passenger train service declined in the area, Andrews Geyser fell into disrepair again. In 1975, the Geyser and the two acres of land it sat on were deeded to the town of Old Fort by Southern Railway. After the Andrews Geyser Restoration Fund was established, the Geyser was repaired and rededicated on May 6, 1976. Andrews Geyser is now used by the town of Old Fort as a public park. Today, the Geyser draws its water from a pond and valve that is located by the Inn on Mill Creek, which is a local bed and Breakfast. An underground cast iron pipe that is six inches in diameter runs downhill from the Inn to the Geyser. There is a lever located on the property of the Inn on Mill Creek that opens the iron pipe and allows the water to flow from the pond to the Geyser. The difference in elevation between the two points is 500 feet. As a result, the Geyser is able to shoot water 80 to 100 feet at times. Sometimes, it is even able to shoot water even higher. The Geyser is surrounded by a concrete basin, and the waterspout comes out of a nozzle that is about one half of one inch. A historical marker with information about the Geyser is located west of Old Fort on SR 1400, which is Old US 70. There is an estimated 200,000 visitors to Andrews Geyser each year."

When the Bank of America stadium is not being used for football and football practices, it is also used for other sporting events and concerts. This is not common, though, as the Panthers needs and other football games fill the schedule. Fans have a number of seating options when attending games at the Bank of America stadium. Most of the seating is called bowl level,'' and this seating is split into the upper bowl and the lower bowl. Both the upper and lower bowls have seating for fans with disabilities. There are also over 11,000 club seats, which are more comfortable and have better views. The most desirable views are from the suites. There are over 150 suites on two different levels, with a total capacity of 2,717. Each suite has chairs to sit and view the game, a lounge area with a buffet area, and a private restroom. They also have televisions in the lounge area so fans never miss a moment of the game. The Bank of America Stadium has hundreds of concession stands on all levels, so fans never have to walk far to find food. They also have nearly 100 restrooms, including 23 that are unisex/family facilities for parents with children. PantherVision controls all of the displays on the message boards, and new for the 2008 season was the DiamondVision LED displays located at end of the stadiums. Other than this upgrade, the stadium hasn't changed much since it was first built."
"Battleship NORTH CAROLINA in Wilmington, NC Offers a Look at History","North-Carolina","Battleship NORTH CAROLINA in Wilmington, NC Offers a Look at History","	The Battleship North Carolina Memorial in Wilmington, NC was founded to pay homage to all North Carolinians who died in the line of service during World War II. The memorial was dedicated in 1962 and the ship became a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Administered by the USS North Carolina Battleship Commission, which was established by statutes of the State of North Carolina in 1960, the upkeep of the memorial relies largely on donations by visitors. The USS North Carolina began its life as a battleship of the U.S. Navy. It was the first new battleship to enter the war after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. She was the lead ship of the two-ship North Carolina class of battleships (her sister ship was the USS Washington) and the fourth Navy ship named for this southern state. She was officially launched in June 1940 and commissioned in April 1941. The USS North Carolina headed to the Pacific in June 1942, just after the Battle of Midway. She would eventually go on to participate in every major offensive in the Pacific theater of World War II. The ship was decommissioned in 1947 and transferred to the ownership of the people of North Carolina in 1961. A year later, a fleet of tug boats pulled her to the site where she now sits in honor of the war dead of North Carolina. Visitors to the ship can view the Roll of Honor, which includes the names of more than 10,000 North Carolinians from all branches of the armed forces. The names are listed by county and all counties are represented. In its function as a museum, the Battleship North Carolina entertains and educates visitors with a large collection of artifacts. The artifacts are either original items that were found aboard the ship or items that were donated from personal collections. Many were left intact after the ship was decommissioned and are an important part of the ship tours. Additional artifacts are from other ships named North Carolina, including an Ironclad, a Ship-of-the-Line, and an Armored Cruiser, all predecessors of the battleship that is on display. The USS North Carolina Battleship Commission continues to collect artifacts and to embark upon restoration projects that will restore the ship to its original condition. The members of the commission are all volunteers from the area, selected by the governor of North Carolina, and include former military personnel. The ship is open for tours all year long with shorter hours during the months between Labor Day and Memorial Day. The tour is self-guided and it generally takes about 2 hours to complete the tour. Guests may begin their tour in the Visitors Center, where they can view an orientation film about the history of the ship and her current status as a memorial. The remainder of the tour includes access to nine decks of the battleship featuring numerous rooms and compartments to explore. Admission discounts are available for groups of 10 or more and children under 5 are admitted free of charge."

"Bodie Island Lighthouse","North-Carolina","Bodie Island Lighthouse - North Carolina - Historical Striped Lighthouse in Outer Banks","The original Bodie Island Lighthouse was created in 1847 after hundreds of ships were wrecked off the dangerous waters of the Outer Banks. So many ships were shipwrecked in this area that it was dubbed the Graveyard of the Atlantic,'' and folklore states that the island got its name from the many shipwrecked bodies that washed ashore. However, due to engineering flaws the tower ended up being a foot taller on one side. Therefore the lighthouse was destroyed and plans were made to reconstruct a second one, as opposed to salvaging the first model. The second tower stood almost 90 feet tall and had a third order Fresnel lens. This lens cast a beam that could be seen for 15 nautical miles. However, during the Civil War the Confederate Troops feared that the Union Army would use the lighthouse as a lookout so they destroyed it. Therefore, the lighthouse that can be seen today is actually the third attempt at the structure. The present-day lighthouse was built on the north side of the Oregon Inlet. The lighthouse can be found on the sound side of Highway 12. It is on Bodie Island, the northern most island in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, located between Nags Head and the Oregon Inlet. It was put in service in October of 1872 and is still working today. The lighthouse is tall and slim with horizontal black and white stripes. It is 156 feet and has a first order Fresnel lens that can be seen for 19 nautical miles. Automated in 1954, the Bodie Island Lighthouse still flashes every 22 seconds. Visitors say that the lighthouse actually appears to be much larger as you can spot it from miles away. As the lighthouse is still working it is not open for climbing, though visitors may stand in the lower portion and look up the 214 stairs that wind their way up to the top of the tower when volunteers are present. There is a visitor center and gift shop, which is created in the former keepers' quarters. There are also exhibits that tell the history of the lighthouse. Admission to the lighthouse is free. The grounds are also a good place to go bird watching and there is a self-guided nature trail in the marshes surrounding the lighthouse. Even during the winter months many coastal birds can be seen. The National Park Service is currently in charge of the lighthouse though the United States Coast Guard maintains the lighting apparatus. The Outer Banks Lighthouse Society is assisting with a renovation project, as the tower is in need of complete restoration. Work will begin in August of 2009 to kick off an eighteen-month project to renovate the lighthouse. $3 million was included in the 2009 Omnibus Budget Bill to replace metalwork, repair the masonry and stone, and rehabilitate the floors, windows, and framing. The electrical systems will be upgraded as well. The rare, first-order Fresnel lens will be restored by funds given earlier in the year as well."

The museum was founded in 1898 with a collection of Confederate relics. It was originally housed in one room in the Wilmington Light Infantry Building and was run by the Wilmington chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy. The museum moved to Raleigh during World War I but eventually made its way back to Wilmington about a decade later. New Hanover County took over control of the museum in the 1977 and the first paid staff arrived a few years later. The museum continues to grow, now housing more than 50,000 objects. It is also now accredited by the American Association of Museums. Today, the Cape Fear Museum in Wilmington consists of both permanent and temporary exhibits. Permanent displays at the museum include Cape Fear Stories, an interactive exhibit that allows visitors to explore life in Lower Cape Fear throughout the centuries through the use of photos, artifacts, models, and three-dimensional diorama-type settings. The outdoor Maritime Pavilion profiles the importance of Wilmington's location on the Cape Fear River and explores the watercraft that local residents have used over the decades to sail the waters. The Michael Jordan Discovery Gallery is designed for Cape Fear Museum's younger visitors. Built to resemble Lower Cape Fear's environment, this interactive hands-on area of the museum not only allows for lots of play time but also teaches children about soils, plants, and animals of the maritime region and upland forest. Kids will also enjoy the opportunity to visit with one of Wilmington's oldest residents, a replica of a 1.5 million-year-old giant ground sloth that was fashioned from bones found nearby in 1991. Temporary exhibits occupy a great deal of space at the museum and there are usual at least two of these exhibits at Cape Fear Museum at any given time. Generally, they remain open for at least a few months, sometimes longer. Access to these special visiting exhibits is included with general admission to the museum. The Cape Fear Museum hosts a variety of special events and programs that are open to the general public. Family events are held each Saturday at the onsite Learning Center and most events are appropriate for children up to age 12. The museum also offers programs specifically geared towards adults. Held once or twice each month, these programs might include lectures or symposia led by area experts in the history, science, or culture of the Lower Cape Fear region.

This lighthouse is known for its distinctive barber pole look that has given it the nickname of The Giant Barber Pole'' from people all over the country and the world. This lighthouse was used to warn ships of the dangerous shoals for over 100 years. These shallow sandbars extended out for more than 14 miles out from the shore off of Cape Hatteras. The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was constructed with more than 1 million bricks that were kiln baked near Virginia's James River. When the lighthouse was painted, it has been said that the engineer who was directed to paint the lighthouse was directed to paint diamond shapes, but he misunderstood, and painted stripes instead, leaving us with the large barber pole design that we see today. The lighthouse is open from April to the middle part of October for visitors to climb up in the lighthouse and get a first rate view of the area that surrounds the lighthouse. Existing buildings that were quarters for the keepers of the lighthouse are around the structure and this allows you to learn more about how these people lived when they were working to keep the lights burning.

"Cape Lookout National Seashore","North-Carolina","Cape Lookout National Seashore - Harkers Island, NC - Undeveloped and Primitive Beaches","Cape Lookout is a National Seashore run by the National Park Service.  The Seashore is actually comprised of a series of islands on the Outer Banks. It covers the southern portion of the Outer Banks and is largely without paved roads and man made facilities, unlike the Cape Hatteras National Seashore to the north. The narrow seashore runs from Ocracoke in the north to Beaufort in the south. Located on Harkers Island in North Carolina, the only part that is reachable by car is the visitor center on the eastern end about twenty miles from Beaufort. A personal boat or ferry can be used to reach the multiple islands. Ferries operate from Harkers Island, Beaufort, Morehead City and Ocracoke. Pedestrians and those with 4-wheeler vehicles are accommodated on ferries from Davis and Atlantic. Ferries usually run from March to December. The lighthouse at Cape Lookout is recognizable by its black and white diamond pattern. It was closed in 2008 to tours due to safety issues regarding the stairway to the top of the lighthouse. While it is closed visitors can still access the Keeper's Quarters Museum and the Cape Lookout Light Station Visitor Center. Cabins and tent spaces are the available accommodations. There are a total of 21 cabins open from April to December and they use bunk beds to accommodate four to twelve people. Cabins have a hot water heater, table, chairs, kitchen, stove, and private bath. It is suggested that visitors bring their own linens or sleeping bags, cookware, ice and a cooler because there are no refrigerators, and any food or beverages needed. Solar electricity is provided at the Long Point cabins but those staying at Great Island Cabin Camps will need to bring lanterns or other forms of light as there is no electricity.

Insects can be very bad in the early evening to early morning hours on all of the Outer Banks islands. Cape Lookout is primarily a recreation park for beach goers, boaters and fishermen. There are no marked trails on the islands for hiking but it is not uncommon to see people wandering the island. Ranger programs are usually held at the lighthouse area and cover topics such as ecology, shipwrecks, guided walks and a touch tank. A ranger program at Portsmouth Village explores the life of the historic village. The waters off of Cape Lookout are a feeding ground for both sea turtles and marine mammals. While there are four species of sea turtle found feeding off the coast only one, the Loggerhead, makes its nest on the beaches of the seashore. Bird diversity is caused by weather and migration and includes egrets, herons, and many other shore birds. Land mammals are uncommon on the islands of Cape Lookout. Otters, rabbits, and raccoons are common, as are rats. Shackleford Banks is home to a colony of wild horses that were once domesticated hundreds of years ago. Tree frogs and toads are found in small pockets of fresh water habitat while the marsh lands are full of terrapin turtles. The grasslands on the islands are home to racerunner lizards and black racer snakes. Beach driving is permitted for off road vehicles and vehicles with four wheel drive on certain sections of the beach that are not used heavily for swimming."

This 5,000 square-foot rock house is the oldest home in Mecklenburg County and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

"City Market Neighborhood in Raleigh, North Carolina a Charming Locale","North-Carolina","City Market Neighborhood in Raleigh, North Carolina a Charming Locale","	The historic City Market neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina was formed in 1914, just before the start of World War I. The centerpiece of the neighborhood is City Market, a farmer's market-type establishment that cost $23,000 to build and has stood the test of time. The market continued to flourish until after World War II, attracting farmers from all parts of the state as well as housewives from the city who came to buy fresh produce, meats, and baked goods. However, by the 1950s, the advent of supermarkets ushered in hard times for the market and the neighborhood around it. By 1957, it was closed and leased to a furniture company. It remained as such for a few decades. In 1980, the City Council began to study the architectural resources in the area and submitted the City Market and surrounding area for consideration for the National Register of Historic Places. It was approved and revitalization of the market and other nearby buildings began. The result has been the resurgence of a vibrant neighborhood with the market still at its center. City Market now occupies one square block and features about 30 shops, restaurants, and offices. The shops and boutiques at the market are not the usual mall fare. What visitors will find here is a collection of unique stores offering everything from boutique clothing to international gifts to gourmet chocolates.

Dry Falls offers scenic views of the 80' waterfalls and surrounding area. To get to Dry Falls take Highway 64 west from Highlands and the Highway 106 intersection 3.3 miles. If coming from Franklin, take Highway 64 east 5.5 miles past Cullasaja Falls. Watch carefully for the National Forest signs as the turn in to Dry Falls is not easily seen from the highway. The National Forest service had to temporarily close Dry Falls in 2007 while they increased the size of the parking lot and made the site more handicapped accessible. They occasionally make upgrades so the park is not always open to the public. In order to assure access make sure you call Nantahala Ranger District office at 828-524-6441 and double check that they are going to be open. There used to be a small fee to park at the park, but now there is only a donation box. Donations go towards upkeep and improvement of the park so it's definitely a worth while cause. The waterfall is only a short walk from the parking lot, and some of the best views are as you approach so have your camera ready. The park is open year round and the path down to the falls is sometimes uneven. During the winter the mist from the water fall and other moisture can freeze on the path and cause slippery ice. Make sure you are well supported and take it slow. Also keep your head up, the path takes you right next to rocky outcrops and those paying too much attention to where they are walking can walk right into part of the mountain. The 80' foot waterfall is created by a dramatic drop off in the Cullasaja River. A walk way extends behind the falls and is about 30' from the top. This allows for great photo opportunities. The mist from the falls is sure to get you a little wet, so make sure your camera is protected and you don't have anything on you don't mind getting damp. If you're there at the right time of the day rainbows are quite common and make for an added bonus to the scenery. The mist from the falls helps support a lush ecosystem in the granite gorge below and on the sides of falls. Rare plants can be found here and visitors are strictly prohibited from leaving the approved trail. The delicate ecosystem is sustained by a 40-degree difference between the open air and the area around the fall caused by the fall's mist. Despite endangering the delicate and rare plants going off the approved path can lead to injury or worse. A woman who went under a guard rail and down into the gorge was unable to get back up and suffered from sever hypothermia and almost died before she was finally rescued. Regular visitors to the scenic water fall report that it's best to get there as early as possible. The park itself is not very big as people are confined to the set walkways and it can be difficult to get an unobstructed photo during the busier hours."
"Duke Chapel","North-Carolina","Duke Chapel - Durham, NC - A Chapel Rich in Architectural Style","Located as Duke University, Duke Chapel was built between 1930 and 1935. It was actually the first building that was planned for the West Campus. In spite of being the first one planned, it was the last one completed. The chapel has a tower that is roughly 210 feet tall, and Duke Chapel is one of the tallest buildings in Durham County. Although the chapel has connections to the United Methodist Church because of its close proximity to a United Methodist divinity school, Duke Chapel is used as an ecumenical Christian chapel. Able to seat approximately 1,600 people, the chapel has a regular Sunday attendance of about 1,000 during school semesters. Attendance typically rises to 1,500 for special occasions, and Easter services have as many as 3,500 people in attendance. The chapel's architecture reflects the Gothic style and is characterized by its pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and large stone piers. The chapel was built with volcanic stone known as Hillsborough bluestone. The stone was purchased by Duke University and came from a quarry in Hillsborough, North Carolina. Hillsborough stones range in color and include about 17 different shades. Stones can range from slate gray to a rusty orange. The stones from the quarry were various sizes and were all cut into the same size for the construction of the chapel. The stones were made to be twice as long as they were high. Indiana limestone was used to make the pulpit, the lectern, and for other trimmings. While the vaults of the choir are stone, the vaults and walls of the transepts and nave feature Guastavino tile. The tile helps to reduce the strain on the walls because it is lighter than stone. Guastavino's patented sound-absorbing Akoustalith tile covers the structural tile. The entrance to the chapel features ten figures: Bishop Francis Asbury, Bishop Thomas Coke, George Whitefield, Girolamo Savonarola, Martin Luther, John Wycliffe, Thomas Jefferson, Robert E. Lee, Sidney Lanier, and John Wesley. All ten of these were important figures to Protestantism, Methodism, or the American South. Duke Chapel features 77 stained glass windows. It took roughly three years for the windows to be designed and completed. Fifteen artists and craftsmen were involved in the process. Glass was imported from Belgium, England, and France, and more than 1 million pieces of glass were used to make the windows. The chapel is home to three rather large pipe organs. Each of the organs is a different style. The Benjamin N. Duke Memorial organ is a Flentrop organ that is located in the arch that separates the nave and the narthex. Reflecting French and Dutch organ building techniques of the 18th century, the organ's main case is made of mahogany that was painted. The case extends to roughly 40 feet above the floor, and the organ is controlled by a pedal and four manual keyboards. This Flentrop organ contains over 5,000 pipes. Installed in 1932, the Kathleen Upton Byrns McClendon Organ is lodged on both sides of the chancel and includes about 6,600 pipes. Reconditioned it 2008, this Aeolian organ is the chapel's original organ and was designed in the post-Romantic tradition. Modeled after instruments of Italian Renaissance, the Brombaugh organ resides in the Memorial Chapel. The Memorial Chapel was a separate addition to the chapel that is closed to tourists. The pipe shades of the Brombaugh organ are carved from Appalachian oak, and the Duke family crest can be seen at the top of the organ case. During the academic year, Duke Chapel is open to visitors from 8:00am to 10:00pm. Summer hours are 8:00am-8:00pm. During holidays and breaks, the chapel is open from 8:00 to 5:00pm, but it is closed on Christmas Day. The Chapel Information Line is available 24 hours a day and can be reached by calling 919-681-1704. Guided tours are available with a reservation, and there is a parking fee of $2 per hour. The parking fee is waived on Sundays until 1:00pm. Carillon Music can be heard from 5:00pm to 5:15pm Monday through Friday and just before and after Sunday services. Organ music is played on the Flentrop from 12:30pm to 1:30pm on most weekdays. The Chapel Attendants' Desk can be reached by calling 919-681-9488."

"Executive Mansion","North-Carolina","Executive Mansion - Raleigh, North Carolina - The Official Residence of the State Governor","The North Carolina Executive Mansion is located at 200 North Blount Street in Raleigh, North Carolina. Since 1891, the mansion has served as the official residence of the state's governors. Today the home serves as a prominent architectural anchor for the Blount Street neighborhood. The warden of the prison, Col. William J. Hicks, supervised the mansion's construction. The use of convict labor was not new to state projects and widely used. Whenever possible, building materials were acquired from within the state. The bricks were made from Wake County clay and molded by prison labor. Many of these bricks, particularly in the sidewalks surrounding the house, still bear the inscribed names of the men who made them. The home's sandstone trim came from Anson County and the marble steps in front (later moved to the north side) came from Cherokee County. The oak and heart pine were shipped from all across North Carolina for use in building the majestic house. Construction was completed in 1891 and today the mansion remains one of the state's finest examples of the Queen Anne style of Victorian architecture. Its many attractive features include a steeply pitched gable, richly colored textural surfaces, and elaborate turned woodwork. The first occupant of the house was Gov. Daniel Fowle, who stayed from January 5, 1891, until his death on April 7, 1891. Governor Beverly Eaves Perdue was the twenty-eighth governor to live in the mansion. She is the sixty-eighth person to hold this office in North Carolina since the end of the American Revolution and the first woman. The exterior of the mansion is quite grand and boasts brick walkways that lead toward the house. There are beds of flowers and blooming shrubs throughout. Oak trees and magnolias shade the lawns and small beds of holly and dogwood line the main walkway. Flowerbeds around the entrance to the mansion reflect the spirit of the Victorian garden. Colorful beds of plantings admired by Victorian gardeners, such as elephant ears and cannas, create a background for more traditional southern selections, including azaleas, camellias, and rhododendrons. The Southern Victorian Garden lies on the south side of the grounds and provides a private outdoor entertaining venue. The focal point of the garden is a hand-carved limestone fountain from Italy. Other gardens on the grounds include the Kitchen Garden, located behind the mansion at the kitchen entrance. The Kitchen Garden provides herbs for cooking and edible flowers for garnishing custom meals. The most recent addition to the grounds is a Vegetable and Cut Flower Garden. There is also Woodland Play Area that is located to the far rear of the east lawn. The area has play equipment, a birdbath, and birdfeeders.

Featuring knives, quilts, jewelry, handbags, and more, the general store offers a variety of gift options and souvenirs.

"Hiddenite Gems Emerald Hollow Mine","North-Carolina","Hiddenite Gems Emerald Hollow Mine - Hiddenite, NC - Public Gem Mining","The Emerald Hollow Mine in Hiddenite, North Carolina is a public place where visitors can mine for gemstones. It is located 17 miles north west of Statesville and 38 miles north east of Hickory. The Blue Ridge Parkway is also less than an hour away. The mine is open from 8:30 am to sunset every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and Day. Although the mine has been featured on the Discovery, Travel, and National Geographic channels there have been reports disputing the authenticity of the mine. This includes suspicions about the true origin of the gems found. Many believe the gems to be brought in and placed in the buckets, creek, digging area etc. With a guarantee to find a gem in every bucket it would seem highly unlikely that they all occur naturally. Evidence of this can be found in the shape of the stone. A recently broken rock, one that would have been broken from a larger piece, would be sharp and angular. Rocks that are likely to be found naturally would be weather-worn, more rounded. A reviewer on TripAdvisor reported an employee admitted to stocking the creek with gems at least twice a day. There are sixty-three different kinds of gems located in the mine. It is not uncommon for visitors to find smoky and clear crystal quartz but more rare gemstones are also occasionally found. Emerald, sapphire and amethyst are some of the more rare gems that have been found. Finds of over a few thousand dollars have occurred and one find was found to be worth over a million dollars. Most mining is not done by the visitors. Ore is brought up in buckets, which visitors wash in a sluiceway. There is plenty of space with three large sluiceways available. Another option for gem searching involves creek mining and searching for gems in designated digging areas. There are seventy acres on which to dig and over a half mile of creek to search. Visitors who will be sluicing must pay a $5 admission fee to sit at a sluice. The first bucket of ore is free but additional buckets cost extra. Additional buckets cost between $2 and $100. The most popular bucket is a five gallon bucket of ore costing $10. A $100 bucket is guaranteed to contain high grade gemstones (further evidence of gem planting). Permits are required for both creeking and digging. Creeking costs $8, which includes the $5 admission fee. Equipment can be rented for $1 plus a $5 refundable deposit. Digging requires the purchase of a $15 permit and includes access to the surface, controlled areas of the mine, sluiceways, and creeks. Equipment for digging can be rented for $2 with a $10 refundable deposit. Diggers can bring their own heavy duty equipment, which includes anything beyond a bucket, shovel and rock pick for $45 instead of $15. Those tools, however, must be approved according to OSHA and EPA guidelines. When a gem is found and identified by mine experts it can be taken to the lapidary shop. There it can be cut into jewelry. Experts cut them into the chosen shape and put them into a setting. Gold and silver settings are available. Premade settings are available but molds are available to have one custom created. The gem placed in the setting and sold to the prospector is guaranteed to be the same stone found by the person who brought it in. The lapidary also sells premade jewelry and lapidary tools to cut stones at home. The machine comes with a free lesson on how to cut gems and facet them. The lapidary also has a jewelry repair service, whether or not the stone is provided. The gift shop contains jewelry pieces, rock and mineral pieces, and raw mine ore. To further accommodate guests the mine also has restrooms, a picnic area, gift shop, and lapidary. School field trips are available and include an earth science lesson, sluicing, creeking and surface collecting."

"Historic Oakwood in Raleigh, North Carolina a Joy to Explore","North-Carolina","Historic Oakwood in Raleigh, North Carolina a Joy to Explore","	A 19th century neighborhood located near downtown Raleigh, North Carolina, Historic Oakwood is best known for its beautiful homes and breathtaking gardens. It is the only intact 19th century neighborhood in the capital city. Oakwood was formed after the Civil War. Once a densely wooded area, it was sold off in parcels to both individuals and developers. Many of the parcels were purchased by local politicians and well-known war heroes who had opulent Victorian homes built for them in this up-and-coming part of the city. A great variety of architectural styles are represented, reflecting the diverse tastes of the original owners. By the 1920s, however, the face of the neighborhood had changed and many of the original owners moved to newly-formed suburban areas. A large number of the houses were converted to apartments or boarding houses and remained as such for more than four decades. In the 1970s, with many of the homes in a serious state of disrepair, an urban renewal project was prompted for this historic area. In 1972, the Society for the Preservation of Historic Oakwood was formed to stop a major thoroughfare from dissecting the area. They organization was successful and revitalization continued. A walk through the Historic Oakwood neighborhood is a treat, especially for architecture buffs. Here you'll find a 	variety of home styles including neo-Classical/Greek, Second Empire French, Queen Anne Victorian, and many others. However, most of the houses have in common the features which are most often found in the U.S. south, including expansive porches (some with blue ceilings to resemble the sky), deep pitched roofs that allow for large attics and extra insulation, and rear service porches with latticework for circulation of air on particularly hot days. Place on the National Register of Historic Places in the 1980s and made a local historic district in 1974, the architectural integrity of these homes is now fiercely protected and changes cannot be made without permission of an architectural review board. While visitors can enjoy the exterior of these historic homes all year long, there are a few yearly opportunities to explore the inside of some of the houses and their lush gardens. In the spring, the local Garden Club sponsors an annual Garden Tour and Victorian Tea. Guides travel with guests through the neighborhood, pointing out particular garden and architectural features. Following the tour, guests gather in particular houses to enjoy an old-fashioned afternoon tea. In the wintertime, generally about two weeks prior to Christmas, the neighborhood sponsors a Candlelight Tour, featuring 10 beautifully decorated homes that open their doors to visitors who wish to explore the interior features of these houses. This tradition is more than 35 years old and always attracts several hundred architectural buffs for the 6-hour open house. Tickets are required for both events. Residents also enjoy their own organized activities, planned on a regular basis. These include monthly social gatherings, quarterly picnics featuring music or some other form of entertainment, and preview tours and a party a few days before the official Candlelight Tour."

"Independence Boulevard in Charlotte","North-Carolina","Independence Boulevard in Charlotte","Independence Boulevard has a history of being the first urban highway in Charlotte, North Carolina. The highway consist of the I-485 (The Outerbelt), Interstates 85 and 77, and the Belk and Brookshire Freeways (I-277). The planning of the highway in the 1940's gave the city of Charlotte the boost that it needed to start transforming from a small town into an urban city. The former mayor at the time, Ben Douglas, pushed for the construction of Independence Boulevard and in 1946 secured the funding needed to start building the highway. The highway did not reach full completion until the mid 1950's. The history of Independence Boulevard can be seen in much of its infrastructure. Facilities and stores built in the 1950's stand on each side of the highway, many are in need of restoration or have become completely vacant. Over the last decade, Independence Boulevard has seen an emergence of car dealerships, small strip mall areas, and fast food restaurant chains. Large retailers have moved away from the boulevard and left behind struggling businesses. Residents are hoping for a revitalization of the boulevard that was once buzzing with vibrant activity. For now, the road is definitely not a tourist attraction and visitors to the city have no other reason to head to the boulevard unless they are planning a visit to a specialty store or restaurant along the street. Independence is not walkable or scenic which keeps it off the list of Charlotte's top attractions. Many of the struggling owners that are holding tightly onto their business can remember the days when the boulevard was filled with businesses and shoppers. The once booming Coliseum Center situated right off Independence feels like a ghost town with boarded stores and vacant parking lots. Many business owners on Independence Boulevard feel the economy of the road took a turn for the worst in 2002 when construction on the boulevard turned the street into a highway and took away its reputation as a boulevard for shopping. The City of Charlotte defends its plans to turn Independence Boulevard into a freeway and promises that the end result will be economic stability and growth of the neighborhoods that are situated off of Independence. Not all businesses are going downhill because of the construction that has overtaken the famous boulevard. Over the last few decades changes have transformed the structure of Independence Boulevard and the role it plays in the organization of Charlotte. Pieces of the streets have been renamed after the intersecting avenue and area. For example, in 2007, the southern portion of Independence Boulevard was renamed Charlottetowne Avenue. Independence Boulevard in Charlotte still stands as one of the main roads in Charlotte and residents in the Southeast use the road in order to make their way into downtown. Because of the heavy use of the road, traffic and congestion are problems yet to be solved by the city's highway commission. The boulevard serves as one of the main arteries into the city - for many drivers, Independence is the first street they see when they come into Charlotte."

"Jockey's Ridge National Park","North-Carolina","Jockey's Ridge National Park - Nags Head, NC - Natural Sand Dune State Park","Jockey's Ridge State Park, located in Nags Head, North Carolina at milepost 12 on the Highway 158 Bypass (South Croatan Highway). It is the tallest natural sand dune system on the East Coast and the park is one of the most significant landmarks on the Outer Banks. It is open from 8:00 AM until 8:00 PM in March, April, May, September and October. In November through February it is open from 8:00 AM until 6:00 PM and from 8:00 AM until 9:00 PM in June through August. The park is closed on Christmas Day. Jockey's Ridge has three different ecological environments. Dunes have three peaks of shifting sand that lack vegetation. Maritime Thicket next to the dune has a variety of trees that are home to larger animals like foxes, deer, and raccoons. The Roanoke Sound Estuary is a habitat that many animal and bird life call home. Many fish and Blue Crab can be found in the estuary, as well. While there are no camping facilities available at the park, there are picnic shelters, a Visitor Center, Museum, and Auditorium. There is a 384-foot boardwalk that ends with a view of Jockey's Ridge, which is handicap accessible. There are benches for visitors to wait for their families who are playing in the dunes, as well as transportation to the top of the dunes. However, transportation depends on the availability of a vehicle and requires 24-hour notice. Free programs are offered to the public and vary with each season. Some programs include Kayaking, Birding on the Sound, Sunset On the Ridge, and Seine the Sound. There are also hiking, airborne activities, and water sports. Tracks in the Sand is a mile and a half trail that go over the dunes, to the soundside, and back and shoes are required. The Soundside Nature Trail is a mile loop that focuses on the estuary and scrub thicket ecosystems. The park also offers Hang-gliding to those persons with a USHGA Hang 1 rating card. Kayaking, windsurfing, and swimming are also permitted at the soundside access, which can be found in the southwest corner of the park. Though visitors generally do not encounter many animals, early morning hikers may see a variety of animal tracks. Some animal tracks include red and gray foxes, rabbits, deer, raccoons, and mice. Birds are abundant throughout the park, especially during winter months when the soundside becomes a home to many different waterfowl. In the summer a variety of shorebirds can be seen, and songbirds are found all year long. There are a few safety precautions to keep in mind. In the summer months the sand dunes become very hot and often have lightning storms. It may not be wise to go barefoot, as the sand is 25 to 30 degrees hotter than the air temperature, on average. And if a warning siren sounds while guests are on the dunes it indicates a lightning storm is approaching and guests must clear the ridge as soon as possible. It is also wise to have a landmark that all in the party are familiar with, as family members have become separated while playing on the dunes. Since the dunes are outdoors it is important to do tick checks'' after walking in the park's thickets, as well."

"Levine Museum of the New South","North-Carolina","Levine Museum of the New South, Charlotte, NC","The Levine Museum of the New South in Charlotte North Carolina is a place residents and visitors can explore the history of the Carolina Piedmont area. The museum preserves and collects several objects that have been a part of the North Carolina history. The goal of the museum is education. The name of the museum may seem a little strange for anyone who has not lived in the south. New South'' means the time after the Civil War or the War Between the States. Artifacts in the museum will date from 1865 to the present. Levine Museum provides a history museum in which patrons can engage in the history. The Civil War was more than a fight to end slavery. It was also a way to reach further in economics, politics, and culture. The South had to reinvent themselves since it was the southern states that still had slavery. The war changed how societies interacted and how new individuals were accepted. Change in the south took a long time, even after the war. Through the museum an attendee can see the gradual change, the effects it had, and how different races began to interact. Museum Admission and Hours: The museum is open 7 days a week. Monday through Saturday hours are 10am to 5pm. Sundays the museum opens at noon and closes at 5pm. The museum is closed for all major holidays. Admission for adults is $6.00. Children and seniors are $5.00. For a group of individuals the museum charges $4.00. A family can enter the premises for $17.00. Exhibits: Their permanent exhibit is the Cotton Fields to Skyscrapers. This exhibit showcases the southern movement from plantations to larger financial businesses. Plantations in the south were the main means of survival. Plantations were for growing cotton, crops, and tobacco. While they certainly had empires of businesses, the financial centers in the south were nothing like what New York City was becoming. Today Charlotte as well as other major southern cities are financial powerhouses. The Levine Museum allows a patron to see this. There are two temporary exhibits at the museum: Changing Places and Standing on a Box. The Changing Places exhibit will be showcased for a year, ending in 2010. Standing on a Box is only at the museum for 3 months. The exhibit will leave in June 2009. Changing Places is based on the New South as it is today. The display discusses the growth of Charlotte North Carolina as one of the top places to live. Individuals from New York, Mexico, Bosnia, Vietnam, and other places have moved into Charlotte in the last nineteen years. It is about the blending of cultures. The South has been catalogued as an isolated area in the US, yet that is changing now. Standing on a Box is a different style of display. It is based on Lewis Hine, a photographer, who obtained photographs of children working in textile mills. The images created a controversy and helped change child labor laws."

"Mid Pines Inn & Golf Club","North-Carolina","Mid Pines Inn & Golf Club, Southern Pines, North Carolina - a Classic Donald Ross Golf Course Designed for Club Members and Guests","The Mid Pines Inn & Golf Club is a Donald Ross golf course that is rare among modern golf clubs. The 18 holes on the course are still in the exact same positions, with the same hole numbers as when the course opened in 1921. The course is nestled in the fragrant pine forests of North Carolina and is considered a throwback to golf when it was pure and simple; or, as some would describe Mid Pines, pure Donald Ross,'' because it conforms to the land where it was built. There are few forced carries found on the course, and no contrived holes. It's been written that Mid Pines was never intended as a daunting task to the finest players competing under championship conditions. Rather, Mid Pines was intended simply as a fun course with adequate challenge for members and guests of a private club and resort. Even so, the course still played host to the 2002 USGA Senior Women's Amateur Championship. Mid Pines is a bit hillier and shorter than its sister course, Pine Needles. The par-72 course plays to a modest 6,528 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 71.0 and a slope rating of 126. Several improvements and renovations have been made over the years, such as leveling the tees, rebuilding and cleaning a pond, and improving the irrigation and drainage system. The greens are still somewhat on the small size, however, especially when compared to those found on many modern courses, and tend to be undulating. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include its collection of par-3s, which are also some of its most popular holes. Hole No. 2, in particular, is one of the most photographed. The hole plays to 178 yards from the longest tees, but also plays uphill to an elevated green that makes for a very difficult target to hit. Another of the noteworthy par-3 holes is No. 13. The hole plays to a lengthy 223 yards from the Blue tees, and 197 yards from the Whites. Adding to the difficulty, the green is narrow and well-bunkered. Some other noteworthy holes include No. 10, a par-5 that plays to 514 yards from the back tees. Considered one of the most beautiful holes on the course, the tee shot calls for a drive up and over a ridge to a fairway that features a number of bunkers. The finishing hole at Mid Pines is the one many golfer most often remember. The par-4 plays to 411 yards from the back tees and is a slight dogleg left, with the approach shot uphill to the green. What's most noteworthy about the hole is the stunning sight of the hotel sitting in the background. There are practice facilities and a number of instructional options available at Mid Pines and Pine Needles, as well as a Pro Shop. Accommodations are also available at the Mid Pines Inn, which features room with an Old South charm. Casual dining and drinks are available at Pop's Lounge and Cosgroves, while the Terrace and Dining Room offers more elegant dining."

"Morehead Planetarium","North-Carolina","Morehead Planetarium, Chapel Hill, NC","Historic Planetarium and center for science located on campus at the University of North Carolina. A gift from John Motley Morehead III to the University of North Carolina as a mark of his gratitude to his alma mater, the Morehead planetarium opened to the public in 1949, the first in the South and only the sixth in the United States. Designed by the same architects who planned the Jefferson Memorial, at the time it was the most expensive building ever built in North Carolina. In 1959 the Planetarium was called to serve the space program as a means to train future astronauts in celestial navigation and it continued in this function until 1975. In 1984 Morehead was amongst the first planetariums to add computer automation to its programs and today the purpose Morehead's original gift has expanded to become the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center''. Located on the north end of the university's campus at Chapel Hill, facilities include the 68-foot, domed Star Theater and Zeiss Model VI Star Projector. The Center prides itself on original shows, written and produced on location at Chapel Hill. In addition to this are a multitude of classrooms and exhibits of a more broad scientific nature. There are observation decks and a reflecting telescope accompanied by gardens, galleries and a giant sundial. Planetarium shows are shown on a multitude of different space-orientated topics, with 8000 stars projected onto the Theater's dome. Also on offer are Science 360'' experiences. As well as space themed topics, these shows aim to bring current, newsworthy science to a broader audience and topics such as the human brain, allergies, global warming, stem cells and just what happened to Pluto. Science LIVE''shows are yet another interpretation of science available at the center. The emphasis here is on demonstration and live experiments in both the fields of physics and chemistry. Continuing with the theme of education the Center offers a vast array of opportunities for people of different ages and backgrounds to get involved in science at varying levels of intensity. These include sky watching sessions, family or adult classes, public lectures and opportunities to meet scientists on staff. There are after school get-togethers, science clubs for middle school children and even a Summer Camp offering half and full day sessions for children up to eighth grade. Visitors have commented on value for money as far as the Planetarium shows are concerned and a discount that is applied for attending more than one in a day and provides even better value. Guests also remarked on the gift shop, which although small provided a satisfactory range of space related gifts. The only criticisms related to the age of some of the equipment used for narration and the dilapidated state of some of the exhibit space, although visitors did comment that this was free to access. On the whole the opinion stated was that the building itself was in need of attention although as a result of the inexpensive nature of visiting the Center, this did not detract from visitor' s opinion."

"Mountainside Theatre","North-Carolina","Mountainside Theatre - Cherokee, NC - Theatre Performance of Cherokee Indian History","The Mountainside Theatre is situated on the appropriately named Drama Road in Cherokee, North Carolina. It has reenacted dramas to the public since 1950, telling the tales of the Cherokee Indians. During that time some 6 million visitors have been to the theatre to be entertained by the shows. The idea for the theatre was spawned in 1946. The Western North Carolina Associated Communities wanted to find ways to increase tourism in the area. In doing so it created a Projects Committee to find the perfect venue for the theatre. The quiet mountainside venue was selected as it provided great acoustics and was protected from the wind by the bow shaped terrain. It also helped that the sun set behind the audience so there was no danger of them not being able to see properly. The area was large enough to provide for 2800 seats, and given there was already a road on the mountain side it helped to minimize the size of the task when it started in 1948. The main attraction since 1957 has been the drama entitled Unto These Hills'', which is a story recounting the history of the Cherokee Indians. Whilst the play maintains the same theme over the years, it has taken on many rewrites bringing the story up to date. It is the second longest running outdoor drama in the United States. The drama consists of 14 scenes, starting from the early days of the Cherokee Indians in 1540. It flows through the years re-enacting the battles and politics affecting the Cherokees. The show ends with the Horse Dance, which is a celebration of all the creator has blessed the people with. Whilst the theatre is relatively small, there is quite a large cast and production team involved. Nearly 40 actors help to create the drama and perform the dances. A further 20+ people form part of the production team. There is also an additional show being introduced from 2009. The Cherokee Little Theater performance will be aimed more at children and runs for approximately one month from the beginning of July to August. This will also relate the traditional stories of the Cherokee intertwined with more dance. The performance generally runs for two hours including an interval, and is suitable for people of all ages costing $18 for adults and $8 for children under 12. The theatre also caters for disabled people with accessible seating and parking available, and a golf cart shuttle service. Parking for everyone is free of charge. The theatre is only open for a short period in the year. The public can only visit between June and August by booking a reservation in advance. Group bookings can also be made at a discounted price. Visitors who have seen the performance of Unto These Hills gave mixed reviews. Most of them praised the story saying it was very educational and how well it has been updated. However, there was a fair amount of criticism levelled at the performance itself, with some implying it was quite amateurish"
"Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, NC Features Fascinating Exhibits","North-Carolina","Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, NC Features Fascinating Exhibits","	The North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences is located in Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina, situated in the center of the state. It is the mission of the museum to enhance the public's understanding and appreciation of the environment in ways that emphasize the natural diversity of North Carolina and the southeastern United States and relate the region to the world as a whole.'' First known as the North Carolina State Museum, this attraction was founded in 1879 as a combination of collections of State Geologist Washington Caruthers Kerr (rocks, minerals, fossils, and woods) and Commissioner of Agriculture Col. Leonidas LaFayette Polk (agricultural products). For the next 100 years, the museum continued to expand, acquiring a number of new specimens each year, either through research expeditions or from donations from personal collections. A huge donation of local freshwater fauna from Duke University nearly doubled the museum's collection in the 1990s. In April 2000, the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences moved to its new and current location, making it the largest museum of its kind in the southeastern United States. During that same year, the North Carolina Museum of Forestry in Whiteville was established as a satellite facility and plans began to take shape for an education center for school groups and teachers and a 95,000 square-foot Nature Research Center. Today, the four floors of the museum are filled with a variety of exhibits ranging from live animals and prehistoric fossils to plenty of hands-on displays that delight all ages. Permanent exhibits at the Museum of Natural Sciences include North Carolina's Natural Treasures, a look at the diverse eco-systems of the state; Coastal North Carolina, featuring items found on the state's Atlantic Coast including live sea creatures; Mountains to the Sea, an exhibit featuring models of a number of diverse geological features of the state; Nature's Explorers, a nod to the museum's history; and Underground North Carolina, a display of the gems and minerals found in the state's rich soil.

In 2002, the Museum was renovated, and nearly one million dollars were spent on the renovations. The renovations included the addition of new exhibits and also expanded the Museum's mission. The exhibits added in 2002 explain several different concepts and processes. One such exhibit explains how mountains were formed millions of years ago by the geological process. Another exhibit explains why an abundance of minerals resulted in the geological activity of the Linville Falls Fault. The Museum contains several additional exhibits, which are geared towards educating visitors about minerals and topics related to or dealing with minerals. The Mineral Mart'' exhibit explains what role minerals mined in North Carolina play in relation to the state's economy as well as to the economy of the region and the world. Another exhibit details what minerals actually are, how they are identified, and how they are classified. Enter the Mine'' is an exhibit that explains how minerals are mined, how they are processed, and also how they are incorporated into the manufacturing of a variety of products.

"Museum of the Cherokee Indian","North-Carolina","Museum of the Cherokee Indian - Cherokee, NC - Museum Including Exhibitions and Lectures","The Museum of the Cherokee Indian is set on tribal land in the Great Smoky Mountains of Cherokee in North Carolina. The mountains were the home of the Eastern band of Cherokee Indians for eleven thousand years. This not for profit organization aims to reproduce the history of the tribe, and retrace their steps and traditions. When it was opened in 1948, the museum was essentially just a log cabin. It has since evolved in to a relative hi-tech art house after moving to its current site in 1976, with exhibitions, lectures and workshops to keep visitors entertained. The relatively unknown language adopted by the Cherokee in 1821 can be heard too. Visitors are welcomed with an interactive service, which includes a virtual Cherokee guide unveiling the myths and legends of the Indian tribe. The Cherokee Indian history is traced from the beginning with Kanati and Selu, who were the tribe's equivalent of Adam and Eve. This is recounted in the Story Lodge and flows through time to the first European settlers and on to recent history. A hands-on experience of Cherokee Indian culture and traditions is just one of the attractions for the museum. Visitors are able to learn how to make baskets, pottery, beadwork or arrowheads under tuition from one of the Cherokee craftsman. Workshops are open for individuals or groups to try out these specific skills. There are also lectures from acknowledged scholars on various Cherokee subjects, including archaeology. One hour programs are designed to inform visitors about the history of the tribe and the area they lived in. This includes a lecture from a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, who tells stories of his ancestor's past. The Cherokee Indian culture can be sampled as part of the Cherokee experience. There is a one hour program designed to show the music and dance skills of the tribe, and groups visiting the show are encouraged to participate. Nature and heritage trails are also offered but all these experiences are at a cost on top of the admission fee. The museum is an interesting fusion of old and new. Whilst the history and traditional techniques in craft making are presented by the Cherokee Indians themselves, there are many special computerized effects used to promote the tribe and its history. Souvenirs can be purchased at the museum gift shop such as books, jewellery, dolls along with many other items. Reviews of the site from previous visitors mostly suggest it is an interesting place to visit, with impressive movies and exhibits. However, younger children may not find it quite so riveting, as there is a lot of information to take in and so it may be best to keep the visit fairly brief if taking the kids along. Whilst the shop has some expensive items, apparently there are some souvenirs of good value to be bought too. The museum is open all year round, except on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Admission to the museum exhibition for adults is $9, children aged 6-13 is $6, whilst any children under six years of age can enter for free.

The preserve is ecologically diverse, and a line of inland sand ridges protects the forest from the winds of the Outer Banks. The preserve is mainly comprised of four distinct communities: swamp forest, deciduous forest, shrub forest, and interdune ponds. Beech trees, hickory trees, and towering oaks create a canopy of trees. Some of these trees are even hundreds of years old. Nags Head Woods Preserve is home to more than 300 species of plants. While some of the plant life is common, some of the species found in the preserve are considered to be rare. In the spring and summer, water violets, wooly beach heather, and southern tway-blade orchids can be found blooming in the area. The area is also an ideal habitat for different species of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. In addition, the preserve is a nesting area for more than 50 species of birds. Some of these species include summer tanagers, ruby-throated hummingbirds, green herons, clapper rails, wood ducks, red-shouldered hawks, and pileated woodpeckers. In addition, the western side of the preserve features a marsh system that borders Roanoke Sound. This marsh system is home to additional wildlife, such as egrets, otters and a variety of waterfowl. Run Hill and Jockey's Ridge are two of the biggest active sand dunes on the East Coast. They both run along the borders of the preserve and offer visitors another opportunity to see something unique. Run Hill runs along the northern border of the preserve, and Jockey's Ridge can be found at the preserve's southern border. As northeasterly winds blow, both dunes change shape and are constantly moving. Jockey's Ridge is the largest sand dune system on the East Coast and spans roughly 420 acres. With over 5 miles of self-guided hiking trails, the preserve offers trails for every hiker, ranging in difficulty from easy to strenuous. The trails are open for foot traffic only. Bikes, horses, and dogs are not permitted on the trails, although they are allowed on the gravel roadway. Trails featured at the preserve include: Nags Head Town Trail, Blueberry Ridge Trail, Center Trail, Discovery Trail, Roanoke Trail, and Sweetgum Swamp Trail. During the 1800s and early 1900s, Nags Head Woods was a village community that included farms, two churches, a store, a school, a shingle factory, and 13 homes. As a result, the preserve is also host to some of the cultural history of the Outer Banks. Artifacts from the village community still exist, such as cemeteries and a home foundation.

The museum interprets the state's history through exhibitions, educational programs, and publications available to the visitor on-site or through distance-learning technologies.'' The idea for such a museum evolved in the late 1800s when a local city news editor recognized the importance of such a museum and began touring the state to gather artifacts and to document the stories surrounding them. This collection by Frederick Augustus Olds was eventually combined with an existing small collection to form the first state history museum, dubbed the Hall of History. In the decades that followed, the museum collection would be moved several times as it continued to outgrow its then-current facilities. In 1989, the museum broke ground for its current location and a $29 million state-of-the-art building was completed in 1992. It consists of 55,000 square-feet of gallery space, a large research library, classroom spaces, design shops, conservation labs, and a 315-seat auditorium. Today, the museum owns about 150,000 objects spanning six centuries of North Carolina history. Curators research artifacts and topics relevant to the collections and develop exhibits based on their findings, so exhibits do change periodically.

The island where the beach is found is a half mile wide and 16 miles long. It is part of the 72 mile Cape Hatteras National Seashore which was established in 1953; it was the first National Seashore designated by the U.S. and is under the jurisdiction of the National Parks Service.

Lifeguards from the National Park Service are on duty daily, from 9 AM to 6 PM, between Memorial Day and Labor Day. There are restrooms as well as changing rooms available at this beach. Ocracoke Lifeguard Beach, Outer Banks, North Carolina is famed for its natural splendor, bereft of large constructions and also for its clean water. There are no large resort hotels on the island. In 2007 it was named the number one beach in the United States by Professor Stephen P. Leatherman of the Florida International University. Leatherman, who is better known as Dr. Beach, has made a list of the nation's Top 10 Beaches since 1991 based on a prior study of 650 U.S. public beaches and on 50 criteria of analysis. The Carolina beach was the first beach outside of Florida or Hawaii to have ever reached the number one spot on the list. Having reached the rating as best beach in 2007 this beach was retired from the running in the future. The beach is on the Atlantic Ocean with the Palmico Sound on the opposite side of the island from the beach. This area is said to have been a favorite spot for Blackbeard the pirate. The difficulties for ships navigating in front of this beach and its shoreline earned the area the name of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. The US-English War of 1812 as well as numerous hurricanes contributed to leaving destroyed and wrecked ships in the waters off the coast of this beach. Surfing, kite boarding, parasailing and snorkeling are popular at Ocracoke Lifeguard Beach, Outer Banks, North Carolina, and equipment can be rented from shops near the beach.

"Pack Square","North-Carolina","Pack Square - Asheville, North Carolina - A Beautiful Park in the Making","Pack Square is an area in downtown Asheville, North Carolina that is being transformed into a public park with over 6.5 acres of space for visitors to relax and enjoy. The much-anticipated opening of Pack Square Park will happen in stages in 2009. The historic Pack Square is scheduled to be finished by the end of April 2009.  The end of 2009 will complete the remainder of the park, Reuter Terrace and Roger McGuire Green, and a park pavilion should be completed in 2010. During this construction phase, events that traditionally take place in this space have been moved to temporary alternative locations. In 1999, the historic Pack Square became a focus of attention for city officials and citizens alike because of a leak in a fountain that was causing subsurface erosion and undermining the streets. It was determined that significant repairs needed to take place. The Downtown Commission hosted a meeting and as a result the Pack Square Renaissance task force was formed. Over the next several years, construction was planned and initiated. Pack Square Park has been supported by hundreds of people who love nature and history. Donors of $25,000 to over a million dollars have donated to make the park elements come to fruition. Their dedication has been recorded in the Donor Directory in the park pavilion. Residents of the Pack Square district as well as those who work in the area are enthused about the green space in their own back yard. The park will provide a wonderful venue for new events, as well as Shindig on the Green, Bele Chere, the Greek Festival, the Fourth of July celebration and countless other events that have traditionally been held on the site. Dozens of benches and trees provide countless opportunities to rest and watch the world go by. Families can enjoy the area with large plats of grass, several interactive water features, and great place to picnic. Shopping and restaurants are located nearby and within walking distance.

"Pilot Mountain","North-Carolina","Pilot Mountain - Mount Airy, NC - Centerpiece of a State Park","With an elevation of 2,421 feet above sea level, Pilot Mountain is a quartzite monadnock. A monadnock is an isolated rock hill, small mountain, ridge, or knob that rises up from a basically level plain or gentle slope. In 1976, Pilot Mountain became a National Natural Landmark. US Route 52 passes by the mountain and offers a view of it. Pilot Mountain is the centerpiece of Pilot Mountain State Park, and the mountain features scenic views of other parts of the park. Pilot Mountain State Park offers visitors the opportunity to ride horses through the woods, canoe in the Yadkin River, or go rafting. Pilot Mountain State Park consists of approximately 3,703 acres of land. After being purchased from J.W. Beasley, the park became the 14th state park in 1968. There is no charge for admission to the park. The park has two segments, which are the mountain segment and the river segment. Most of the visitor facilities are in the mountain segment. Pilot Mountain is part of the Sauratown Mountains, which is a chain of mountains that was named after the Native American tribe known as the Saura. As the earliest known inhabitants in the region, the Saura called Pilot Mountain Jomeokee,'' which means pilot'' or great guide.'' The Saura, who were eventually driven out of the area by the Cherokee, used the distinctive formation of the mountain as a landmark to guide them through the region. The mountain's present-day name comes from the Saura name. Pilot Mountain has two different pinnacles with very common names - Big Pinnacle and Little Pinnacle. Also known as The Knob,'' Big Pinnacle has bare walls of rock that are 200 feet high. The top of Big Pinnacle is rounded and covered with vegetation. Big Pinnacle reaches a height that is roughly 1,400 feet above its surrounding terrain. While Big Pinnacle is closed to climbing, walking the Jomeokee Trail would lead a person around the base of Big Pinnacle. Other trails in the area include the Sassafras Trail and the Ledge Spring Trail. The Ledge Spring Trail is one of the locations that is popular with visitors that want to do some rock climbing. A paved road enables visitors to access Little Pinnacle. In addition, there are trails on the mountain that lead to Little Pinnacle. Viewed from a particular vantage point in the distance, the entire mountain may look like a saddle because of the rise of Little Pinnacle, followed by Big Pinnacle's down-and-up slope. The city of Mount Airy is located just north of Pilot Mountain. Home to rock quarries and known as the birthplace of the actor Andy Griffith, Mount Airy was the basis for Mayberry, the fictional town featured on The Andy Griffith Show. In addition, the fictional city of Mount Pilot was frequently mentioned on The Andy Griffith Show. This fictional city was named in honor of Pilot Mountain. Additional information about Pilot Mountain can be obtained from the office of Pilot Mountain State Park at 1792 Pilot Knob Park Road in Pinnacle, North Carolina.

"Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club","North-Carolina","Pine Needles Lodge & Golf Club, Southern Pines, North Carolina - a Throwback Golf Course Designed by Scottish Legend Donald Ross","The Pine Needles golf course is the design of legendary Scottish golf course architect Donald Ross. The course opened in 1927 and is situated amid the Sandhills of North Carolina, where golfers won't find any mountain vistas or sprawling lakes, just a very natural-looking course with rolling terrain and an endless number of tall, thin pine trees that can make the layout feel like a cathedral. Pine Needles is a throwback to golf in its purest form, with a landscape of gentle sandy hills and hollows. Golfers will also find all of the architectural design elements for which Ross is known, including wide fairways with sand traps right where tee shots tend to land, along with deep, grass-faced greenside bunkers. The greens are medium in size and mostly flat, but feature steep slopes around the edges. The course has experienced several changes over the years, including a recent renovation in 2004 by golf architect John Fought of Scottsdale, who set out to restore the course to its original glory. A key part of that renovation was returning the greens to their original Ross design, while rebuilding their foundations to meet USGA specifications, including replanting them with modern A-1 Bent grass. Another part of the renovation included placing fairway bunkers to serve as the kind of hazard that Ross intended from the tee, while adding yardage to some of the short par-5s that had begun to play like par-4s with today's modern equipment. The result is an 18-hole, par-71 course that now plays to more than 7,000 yards, with a USGA rating of 72.2 and a slope rating of 131 on Bermuda grass. It's generally agreed that the par-3 holes at Pine Needles are among the best in the area and one of the course's best features. Hole No. 3 is a short par-3 that plays to only about 130 yards, but serves as one of the signature holes for the course and is the most-photographed. The hole calls for a precise tee shot over a small pond and wetlands to a putting surface that slopes sharply from back to front and is guarded by bunkers front and back. Perhaps even better than the par-3s at Pine Needles is its collection of par-4s, which have been said to be superb. With the par-4s, Ross saved the hardest for the last, with Holes No. 15, 17 and 18 lurking to ruin what might have been a promising score. The difficulties arise as all these holes narrow significantly as they near the greens, and all call for some intimidating approach shots. Throughout Pine Needles' near century of existence, it has received much acclaim. It hosted the U.S. Women's Open in 1996, when only Annika Sorenstam managed to post a sub-par score for the tournament. More recently, Golf Digest awarded the course 4? Stars, while Golfweek named Pine Needles to its list of America's Best 100 Top Classic Courses. Pine Needles practice facilities include a massive teaching area with multiple teeing areas and practice traps. It's also been jokingly said that the hardest green at Pine Needles is the practice green just outside the clubhouse. The Pine Needles Lodge also offers lodging as well as two dining options, the In-the-Rough Lounge for more casual fare, and the Crest Dining Room for breakfast and lunch buffets and dinner menu."

"Pinehurst Resort & Golf Club","North-Carolina","Pinehurst Resort & Golf Club, Village of Pinehurst, North Carolina - the ``Cradle of American Golf'' Where Legends Have Walked","Pinehurst Resort & Golf Club is known around the world as the Cradle of American Golf,'' where the story of golf in this country has been rooted for more than 100 years since the first rudimentary nine-hole course was built in 1898. The resort has also been a host for the U.S. Open multiple times, is a three-time winner of Travel & Leisure Golf Magazine's Best Golf Resort in America award, and is the home of the famed Pinehurst No. 2 golf course. The resort can boast of eight world-class golf courses in all, including Course No. 4, a Donald Ross design with a Tom Fazio renovation, which hosted the 2008 U.S. Amateur Championship, and Course No. 8, another Ross-Fazio combination, that has twice hosted the PGA Club Pro Championship. But it's the famed Course No. 2 that ranks as the most renowned of the bunch. Donald Ross called the No. 2 Course his best design, and the course holds the distinction of having hosted more major championships than any U.S. golf course. Ben Hogan won his first professional tournament on the No. 2 Course, and E. Harvie Ward, perhaps the greatest amateur golfer of all time, defeated Arnold Palmer at the course in the North Carolina Amateur championship. It was also the sight of Payne Stewart's dramatic 18th-hole putt for his 1999 U.S. Open victory. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,252 yards from the Championship tees, and around 7,000 yards from the Blue tees. The course features wide fairways lined by stands of tall pines and a modest number of fairway bunkers. For golfers who are reasonably accurate, it's been said that's it's virtually impossible to lose a ball at this course. The real challenge at Pinehurst No. 2 comes around and on the greens, which tend to be small and crowned. Approach shots are especially demanding of accuracy, as shots that don't land somewhat close to the flag could roll into a bunker, many of which are quite deep, or one of the steep collection areas that surround most of the greens. The fringe is kept low-cut, which means many golfers will find themselves putting rather than pitching onto the greens from nearby lies. From an aesthetic standpoint, Pinehurst No. 2 is not especially exciting. The course is flat for the most part, with only three elevated greens, no water hazards, and most of the holes playing straight. One of the most noteworthy holes is No. 5, which is generally regarded as one of the best and most difficult par-4s in the country. This hole can play as long as 485 yards from the back tees, and typically yields the fewest birdies. Tee shots that manage to catch the proper landing area in a wide fairway will benefit from a down slope and some additional roll, but that still leaves most golfers with a daunting approach shot to a slightly elevated, crowned green that's guarded by a deep bunker in the front and a severely sloped collection areas in the front and back. How good is Pinehurst No. 2 exactly? It's generally ranked as the #2 course in the country, behind only Pebble Beach. And PGA player Nick Price once said that if he had only one course to play over and over, it would be Pinehurst No. 2. The resort also features extensive practice facilities, along with The Pinehurst Golf Academy, which is listed as one of the Top 25 golf schools in the country. The Pinehurst Resort spans 2,000 acres of land, and offers 427 guest rooms among its three hotels, 44 villa rooms and 30 condominiums. The resort also offers dining and shopping, as well as 24 tennis courts, two croquet lawns and a lawn bowling court. There's also a spacious Spa, a Kids Club, Playground, Teen Program, Beach Club, and pool area."

"River Arts District","North-Carolina","River Arts District - Asheville, North Carolina - Asheville's Answer To New York City's Soho","The River Arts District is the hip and upcoming warehouse-turned-art-district in Asheville, North Carolina. Asheville has been heralded as a prime arts location by many prestigious magazines like Travel & Leisure, Southern Living, and American Style and this district clearly reflects why. Filled with dozens of working art studios,the River Arts District is one of the Asheville area's unique arts neighborhoods. Century old warehouses and manufacturing buildings mostly unheated and with primitive plumbing work, are cover for fine artists and craftsmen. On the flats of the right bank of the French Broad River, visitors will find a Cotton Mill, an 1896 building on Riverside Drive that now houses half a dozen working studios, and the Wedge - a 1916 building on Roberts Street with even more studios. All in all, there are more than seventy artistic people in about 10 or 12 buildings, doing their work with all the comfort of space heaters (in winter) and fans (in summer) while rejoicing at their low cost in rent. Most of the studios are accessible to visitors and customers alike but only by prior arrangement. Some are open limited hours and a few studios have five-day sales only. On the edge of the River District at 240 Clingman Avenue is the Jonas Gerard Fine Art Gallery. The gallery replaced the Bella Vista Gallery, which moved to a new location in Biltmore Village at 14 Lodge St. The Jonas Gerard Gallery is found next to Clingman Avenue Coffee and Catering, a popular place to enjoy breakfast or lunch by the locals.

"River's Edge Golf Club","North-Carolina","River's Edge Golf Club, Shallotte, North Carolina - An Arnold Palmer Golf Course in the Grand Strand Myrtle Beach Area","The River's Edge golf course is an Arnold Palmer design, situated along the Shallotte River on what has been called one of the most extraordinary pieces of property'' in North Carolina's Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Area. The course, which opened in 1999, features seven holes that play atop the bluffs overlooking two miles of grassy, tidal marshlands, divided by the twists and turns of the Shallotte River. The other 11 holes are inland,'' and feature some subtle elevation changes that play through Carolina pines and freshwater lakes. The 18-hole, par-72 course opened in 1999 and is said to have a little bit of everything'' in its design. When playing along the river, the course has a links-style layout comparable to older Scottish golf courses set along the ocean, while the inland holes are said to be reminiscent of Pinehurst and traditional American golf. The course is not overly long, playing to 6,909 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.7 and a slope rating of 149 on Bermuda grass, which ranks as one of the highest in the country. For any golfers attempting the back tees, expect no less than 10 forced carries along the way. Some of the more noteworthy holes at River's Edge include No. 9, which is said to be the hole most golfers will be talking about long after their round is over. This par-5 plays to 570 yards from the Gold tees and 509 from the Whites. The difficulty on this hole is provided by the two landing areas, surrounded by marshland and trees. Off the tee, the shot is fairly straightforward, but golfers can get in trouble simply by landing on the back half of the fairway that slopes downhill toward the marsh of the Shallotte River. From there the second shot plays to another sliver-like fairway landing area, and golfers must choose the right club and angle to hit a landing area that curves toward a narrow green that is 48 yards deep. Hole No. 11 is another par-5 and one of the most scenic holes on the course. The hole plays up to 530 yards from the back tees, but the challenge comes from a narrow fairway guarded by a lengthy bunker on the left. At about the midway point of this hole, it begins to curve left around a lake and marshland, and the trick is finding the peninsula green that turns left toward the water. The finishing hole is a great risk-reward par-4 that challenges golfers to cut the corner as much as they dare. The hole only plays to 390 yards from the back tees, so it's not especially long, but curves right around the river marshland which is eager to collect shots that fade or get too greedy. Since opening in 1999, River's Edge has received a number of honors, including being named one of the Top Courses You Can Play in 2000 by GOLF Magazine. That same publication also named the course one of The Best Courses Near You in 2008. The River's Edge Resort also features an excellent practice facility, as well as a clubhouse that overlooks the course and is home to locker rooms and a restaurant."

It is open from May until the beginning of November, so curiously it is shut around the Christmas period. The main attraction for children, even out of the Christmas season is of course Santa. Visitors can see him in a custom made wooden house in amongst a setting of trees and fake snow. Children can talk to Santa and tell him what they want for Christmas and in return he will give them a good conduct diploma and a further surprise too. Fortunately for the kids, Santa says he never forgets what they ask for. Just in case though, after seeing Santa, there is the opportunity of going to Frosty's Gift Shop. Various souvenirs can be purchased at the shop. The Jingle Bell Theater has various 30 minute magic shows each day. Opposite to this is the Stage Arena where singing, playing and dancing is performed. If after all this the family feels hungry they can take advantage of the picnic area by either purchasing food on site, or by bringing their own lunch. The zoo features various breeds of animal, including a reindeer to carry on the Christmas theme. Children are permitted to give the reindeer his favourite food by hand. Other attractions at the zoo include baby bears and tigers, monkeys, cats, goats and many other animals. The amusement park known as Fun Land has a train called Santa's Express Train, which takes visitors all around the 25 acre theme park and zoo. This does take in Santa's Village as well. There is also a roller coaster with a reindeer face at the front called a Rudicoaster. Children can also entertain themselves on the kiddie cars and boats, without parents' fear of them getting hurt. The Fun Land has other rides you might see at the fun fair, such as a carousel and Ferris wheel. The paddle boats take visitors on Whitebeard's lake, where they can feed the ducks, koi carp and monkeys on Monkey Island. The entire venue boasts many photo opportunities not only with Santa and Frosty, but there are giant fibreglass statues of rabbits, a snowman and a kangaroo. There are also backlit displays of elves and reindeers to enhance the theme. Reviews left by previous visitors to the attractions generally feel it is a little dated and run down, but still great fun for younger children under eight years old. Older children may find it a little boring. Comments were passed about not having to wait long for the rides, as the park was not overcrowded. It seems families return there year after year until their children are a bit older. Even if people cannot make it there, they can make Christmas special for their kids by ordering a signed letter sent to them by Santa himself."

"Sliding Rock in Asheville, NC Offers Lots of Family Fun","North-Carolina","Sliding Rock in Asheville, NC Offers Lots of Family Fun","	A favorite summer attraction in the Asheville, North Carolina area, Sliding Rock is a naturally-formed water slide that has been developed into a tourist destination by the National Forest Service. Located within the Pisgah National Forest, about eight miles from the town of Brevard, this 60-foot flat, sloped boulder has long been a favorite part of this forest for many visitors, both locals and those from outside the area. This natural waterslide is fueled by some 11,000 gallons of water per minute, running down the smooth rocks and providing the perfect slide adventure. Accessible any time of the year but best enjoyed in the warmer summer months, Sliding Rock attracts literally hundreds of visitors each day during peak tourist season, more on the weekends. Riders are welcome to enter the slide one by one and enjoy a quick journey that ends in an 8-foot pool of water. Because the slide is in a cool, mountainous area, the water is generally quite chilly and sliders are advised to wear jean shorts and water shoes to enjoy the ride to its fullest potential. Life guards are on duty from Memorial Day until Labor Day though visitors can try out the slide at any time at their own risk. In the winter time, Sliding Rock freezes over, and though it's impossible to slide at that time, the ice formations on the rock area are very picturesque. It costs only $1 for visitors to the Pisgah National Forest to enter this recreation area. That small fee allows riders to sail down the water slide as many times as they wish. However, the summer season brings lots of visitors so long lines should be expected and visitors should plan their time accordingly. All ages may ride upon Sliding Rock but anyone under the age of seven must slide with an adult. Parents should exercise great care when sliding with younger children. The pool at the bottom is deep enough to demand that all sliders be able to swim. Life jackets are the only form of floatation device allowed at Sliding Rock. Sliding is permitted in sitting position only. Those who do not wish to slide can enjoy watching others journey down the rock from one of two observation areas available at Sliding Rock. Non-sliding guests may also take advantage of the other attractions within Pisgah National Forest, which include water fall visits, mountain climbs, and more. Pets are permitted in the area of Sliding Rock but must be on a leash and are not permitted to slide with their owners. Picnicking is not permitted near Sliding Rock but can be enjoyed at nearby Pink Beds, just a few miles from the rock. Camp sites are not located in the Sliding Rock area but can be found at the Davidson River Campground, the closest facility to the rock. Reservations can be made through the National Forest Service."
"Smoky Mountain Gold and Ruby Mine","North-Carolina","Smoky Mountain Gold and Ruby Mine - Cherokee, North Carolina - Gem Mining and Gold Panning Visitor Attraction","The Smoky Mountain Gold and Ruby Mine is the largest Cherokee gem mine situated on the Qualla Boundary in Downtown North Cherokee, North Carolina. It allows visitors to seek out gems, with the added benefit of having the equipment provided on site. It is open to the public daily between March and November from 10-6 with buses and groups welcome, and admission is free of charge. The Cherokee Indians are thought to have first arrived in the Smoky Mountains around 1,000 A.D, and named the area Shaconage'', or place of blue smoke''. However, the arrival of European settlers and the discovery of gold in neighboring state Georgia brought about a mandate in 1830 from President Jackson forcing almost all the Cherokee to leave. Some refused to leave and hid in the mountains. Prospectors came looking for not just gold in the 19th century, but also silver, tin, copper and zinc, which led to larger companies moving to the area to build mines. By 1889 the Qualla Indian Reservation was chartered in North Carolina to serve as the Cherokee's home. They have remained here ever since and are known as the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. This mining attraction enables visitors to look for hardwearing gemstones such as aquamarines, garnets, topaz, sapphires, emeralds and rubies. There are professionals at hand, who can help identify they type of stone and whether or not it is genuine. If visitors are fortunate enough to find gemstones, they can also have them cut to the customer's specifications. When gemstones are found it is hard to establish exactly what they are, which is why it is important to have professionals at the mine to help visitors. Sapphire and ruby rough for example are both the same mineral called Corundum. Uncleaned these gems will have an outer crust, which has to be removed and cleaned in order to distinguish between the ruby (red) or sapphire (any other color than red). The attraction also has expert jewellery makers there to create custom made jewellery. Stones can be cut and polished to make a nice ring or necklace amongst other things, and can make a nice present for someone. The gold panning part is the biggest attraction for the children. A gold panning kit can be bought for use on site and includes a bag of gold ore, instructions and an eye dropper. Visitors can also purchase a take home kit for use any time and any place, as there are many other mines in the Smoky Mountains. Previous visitors to the attraction have made comments that it is a place worth trying out. That said praise for the mine was not over the top. However, it does appear to be a place that families can enjoy together as children can get messy panning for gold, but it probably would not suit real ore mining enthusiasts. It is a good educational alternative to the beach or a theme park."

Spirit Square originated with a church that was designed by J.M. Michael. It is in a historical building that was erected in 1909 and was originally designated as a church. In the early 1970's the congregation moved out of the old church and into a new facility, however, the pastor wanted to turn the church into a community arts center. By 1975, the old church was in the process of a planned demolishment. A local citizen was able to rally fellow Charlotte residents and save the building from destruction.

"St. Paul's Episcopal Church","North-Carolina","St. Paul's Episcopal Church - Edenton, NC - Oldest Regularly Used Church Building in NC","Located at 100 West Church Street in Edenton, North Carolina, St. Paul's Episcopal Church is North Carolina's second oldest church building. In addition, it is the oldest church building in the state that is still being used regularly. Under the provisions of the Vestry Act of 1701, St. Paul's was the first parish in the colony to organize. St. Paul's was originally a post-in-ground church building that was erected to the east Queen Anne's Creek. At the time, Edenton had not yet been founded. In fact, Edenton was not founded until eleven years later. In 1736, Edenton was the capital of the colony, and it was decided that a new church building should be built. Due to a lack of funding, work on the building eventually came to a halt. The Vestry was not even able to meet for the first time in the new building until April 10, 1760. At that time, the building still was incomplete. The windows remained unglazed until 1767, and the woodwork on the interior of the building was not finished until 1774. By the time the new building was complete, Edenton was no longer the capital. The edifice, which is a Flemish bond brick, is one of Edenton's most important buildings from the colonial period. The church building has had extensive repairs twice. From 1806 to 1809, William Nichols added a steeple and installed a wooden floor, as well as much of the present woodwork. The second set of major repairs took place from 1949 to 1950 and was due to a fire that destroyed the steeple, the roof, and the galleries. The only reason that Nichols' woodwork and pews still stand today is that they had been removed due to a planned renovation prior to the fire. St. Paul's still possesses the book of vestry minutes that was begun in 1701. In addition, the church still has a silver chalice and paten that Edward Moseley gave to the church in 1725. Rich in history, St. Paul's is a point of interest for many that are interested in its link to the colonial days. St. Paul's still operates as a house of worship today. With more than 230 families and 700 or more active members, St. Paul's holds services every Sunday. Holy Communion, Rite One, is held at 8:00am without the choir. A 9:00am breakfast takes place in the Church Hall. At 9:45am, the Church Hall is used for Christian Education for all age groups. Holy Communion, Rite Two, is held at 11:00am with the choir. Nursery services are available in the Parish Hall during the 11:00am service. In addition to the youth group, the present-day St. Paul's offers a total of four adult programs, which take place on Sundays and weekdays. Church members are encouraged to serve the community by helping the following organizations: Edenton Emergency Aid, Habitat for Humanity, the Clothes Closet, the Emergency Response Center, and Edenton-Chowan Food Pantry. Each summer, St. Paul's also sponsors a seminarian and does mission work in Haiti, Honduras, and Uganda. St. Paul's is home to a churchyard that dates back to 1722. Many of the 700 known graves are unmarked, but a group of tombstones known as the Governors Graves is located under the magnolia. The grave of Charles Eden, the individual that Edenton was named for, is located here. Believed to have been erected in the 1950s, the Rector's Study is an old one-room structure that is located on the western boundary of the churchyard. St. Paul's is significant because of its present-day role in the community and its long-standing historical link. Anyone interested in contacting St. Paul's Episcopal Church can do so by calling 252-482-3522."

"State Capitol","North-Carolina","State Capitol - Raleigh, North Carolina - Rich in History and Greek Architectural Influence","The North Carolina State Capitol was completed in 1840 and is one of the best-preserved examples of a major civic building in the architectural style of Greek revival. The Capitol is a National Historic Landmark. Located at One East Edenton Street in Raleigh offers free admission and self-guided tours Monday through Friday. Guided tours are available on the weekends from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday and at 2 p.m. on Sunday. David Paton, an Edinburgh-born architect, oversaw the architecture of the Capitol building. Most of the architectural details including the moldings, ornamental plasterwork, and the honeysuckle crown atop the dome, were carefully patterned after features of ancient Greek temples. The exterior columns are Doric in nature and modeled after those of the Parthenon. The House of Representatives chamber follows the semi-circular plan of a Greek theater and its architectural ornament is in the Corinthian style of the Tower of Winds. The Senate chamber is decorated in the Ionic style of the Erectheum. The only non-classical areas in the building are two third floor rooms and their vestibules, which were finished in the Gothic style. Most of the ornamental ironwork, chandelier lighting, hardware, and marble mantels in the Capitol building came from Philadelphia and the desks and chairs were made by the Raleigh cabinetmaker William Thompson. The Capitol's construction was completed in 1840 at a cost of $532,682.34, which was more than three times the yearly general income of the state at that time. The building is a cross shape, centering on a domed rotunda where the wings join. It is approximately 160 feet from north to south, 140 feet from east to west (including the porticoes), and stands 97-1/2 feet from the rotunda floor to the crown atop the dome. The exterior walls are built of gneiss, which is a form of granite, and the interior walls are made of stone and brick. Until 1888, all of North Carolina's state government housed the Capitol building. Today, only the governor, the lieutenant governor, and their immediate staff occupy office on the first floor. The second floor houses legislative chambers, whereas the State Library and Cabinet of Minerals Room occupy the third floor of the Capitol. Monuments in and around the Capitol honor people and events of North Carolina's history. The earliest bronze statue on the grounds is of George Washington. The statue was placed in remembrance in 1857. The most recent monument at the Capitol honors the men and women from North Carolina who served in the armed forces during the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War. The monument was constructed in 1990. Inside the building are busts, plaques, statues, and paintings that commemorate the state's historical times. Worth noting is statue of Washington portrayed as a Roman general and a portrait of Washington painted by American artist Thomas Sully in 1818. This was the first work of art purchased by the state and can now be viewed by tourists from all over the country, if not world."

"The Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina is the Country's Grandest Estate","North-Carolina","The Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina is the Country's Grandest Estate","	The Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina is the largest privately-owned home in the United States. The house was built by George Washington Vanderbilt, youngest son of American businessman and millionaire William Henry Vanderbilt, between the years of 1888 and 1895. The home is 175,000 square feet in size and boasts 250 rooms. It was intended as George Vanderbilt's summer estate. His love for Western North Carolina and its Blue Ridge Mountain views prompted him to build this expanisve home in Asheville. The Biltmore Estate, considered to be one of the most prominent remaining examples of the architecture of the Gilded Age, was designed by Richard Morris Hunt, a renowned architect who had created other Vanderbilt mansions, including the fabulous Breakers'' in Newport, Rhode Island. It is said to be modeled after the chateaus in France's Loire Valley. It most closely resembles the Chateau de Blois, the former residence of many French kings. Vanderbilt also hired renowned landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, to design the grounds around the estate. Olmsted is best known as the designer of New York City's Central Park. Originally, the self-sustaining estate also included poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms and a dairy, as well as the Biltmore Forest School, the first forestry education program in the United States. Today, much of the 125,000 acres on which the Biltmore Estate once sat has been sold off to the federal government and is now part of Pisgah National Forest. The home and grounds occupy the remaining 8,000 acres. It has been a public house museum since 1965 and is owned by the Biltmore Company, headed by George Vanderbilt's grandson.

"The Blowing Rock Geological Formation - Blowing Rock, North Carolina Large Rock Tourist Attraction","North-Carolina","The Blowing Rock Geological Formation - Blowing Rock, North Carolina Large Rock Tourist Attraction","The Blowing Rock is a huge cliff over 4,000 feet above sea level in Blowing Rock, North Carolina and has been a tourist attraction since 1933. The town is named after the unusual geological formation, which overhangs Johns River Gorge some 3,000 feet below. The name originated from the northwest wind sweeping with so much force through a flume created by the walls of the gorge causing light objects to be blown up in the sky. The tale of how the wind started this phenomenon was that the daughter of a Chickasaw chieftain living at Blowing Rock fell in love with a Cherokee brave from the wilderness below. The brave on seeing the reddening sky one day decided it was a sign he had to return to his tribe, but was torn between doing that and staying with the girl. He decided to leap from the rock in to the wilderness below. The girl prayed for his return on a daily basis to the Great Spirit. One evening a gust of wind blew her lover back onto the rock and they were reunited. It is said that a constant wind has blown from the valley below up to the rock ever since. The unusual shape and size of the rock formation has been formed over millions of years. Much of its features have been caused by the strong pressure on the earth's crust during the formation of the Blue Ridge Mountains. That coupled with immense weathering over the years causing erosion in the rock has created the odd shaped cliff. The rock is the main attraction but there are other attractions at the site. One of the first things people will see on entering the site is a gazebo, whilst nearby there is a trout pond and small waterfall. Walking along the 1200 foot trail will take from 15 to 25 minutes, where visitors can also bring their pets along if they are kept on a leash. There are various points from which great photographs can be taken, including the rock itself and an observation tower. Visitors can observe the natural beauty of the area when they follow the nature walk and sit amongst the gardens at this tourist attraction. There is a snack shop and gift shop on site, and an area for people to take picnics as well. Admission for adults is $6, senior citizens $5, children (4-11) $1and kids under 3 can enter for free. There are reductions for group bookings for parties of 20 or more people, with adults down to $5, senior citizens $4, and 4 to 11 year olds $0.75. It is recommended that group bookings are made in advance so that any special requests can be dealt with accordingly. It is a popular attraction for school field trips. Students can learn much about the history of the rock and surrounding area and about the rock's geological composition. Some reviews from previous visitors suggest the place is well worth a visit, but just as a one off as the views can be taken in for free from many other vantage points in the mountains."
"The Bog Garden","North-Carolina","The Bog Garden - Greensboro, North Carolina - Public Garden and Nature Sanctuary","The Bog Garden in Greensboro, North Carolina is one of three public parks maintained by Greensboro Beautiful Inc. This organization works in conjunction with the City of Greensboro and its citizens to conserve and enhance the beauty of the city. Set up in 1968 as a non profit group it is reliant upon volunteers, and staff of the city Parks and Recreation Department to maintain the beauty of the area. The organization has created three different gardens; The Bicentennial Garden, The Greensboro Arboretum and The Bog Garden, with a fourth due to be opened in late 2009. Each garden has its own identity serving to provide enjoyment for the community and its visitors, and are open all year round from sunrise to sunset. Greensboro also hope that the gardens provide additional benefits such as education, environmental conservation, health and recreation. Set within Benjamin Park at Hobbs and Starmount Farms Road, the Bog Garden is perhaps the most unusual of the gardens and was officially opened in 1991. It displays not only beautiful plants but also attracts many birds and animals indigenous to the area. The garden can be explored by following a half mile raised wooden walkway, which acts as a path over the wetland. The conservation aspect of the garden is underlined by as many as 16,000 plants that were recovered from construction and development sites. Aside from the lush planting of shrubs, trees and ferns, there is a lake attracting geese, ducks and turtles. Many people like to visit the lake to watch and feed the birds. Another big attraction at the Bog Gardens is the 160 foot Dr. Joe Serenity Falls, which are named after Dr. B Joseph Christian. Dr Christian is a retired physician and founder of the park and was largely responsible for the construction of the falls. Not only are the falls dedicated to Christian, there is also a bronze statue of him near the entrance to the bog garden to welcome visitors. Dr Christian's idea for the park came about quite simply through walking the wetland, and thinking it would be nice to have plants and flowers to grace the area. His passion for plants has seen him travel up to 500 miles to collect plants for the bog garden. He helped coordinate resources to rescue plants from being destroyed, whilst also growing many in his own greenhouse. The Bog Garden can be found to the southeast of the Bicentennial Garden, which has a parking lot in Hobbs Road. There is also parking available in Starmount Farms Road. Admission is free of charge but bicycles are not permitted on the Bog Garden trails. Reviews of the gardens left by visitors are very positive. People are struck by the serenity and beauty of the gardens, and the many varieties of plants, flowers and birds that are found at the Bog Garden. Some offer the advice of the need to take along bug spray though."

"The Fourth Ward Neighborhood in Charlotte, NC is a Historic Treasure","North-Carolina","The Fourth Ward Neighborhood in Charlotte, NC is a Historic Treasure","	Located between Graham and Church streets north to south and Tenth to Fifth streets east to west, the Fourth Ward Neighborhood in Charlotte, North Carolina is a lovely blend of beautiful historic homes and more modern architecture. Originally taking its name from its designation as a political unit in the mid 1800s, the neighborhood is far enough from the downtown area to be quiet and pristine, lined with trees and houses dating back to the late nineteenth century. For many decades, the Fourth Ward neighborhood, located in the northwest portion of the city, was the place to live for many of the city's most affluent citizens. More a suburb than part of the city, mainly because the trolley lines did not travel to the Fourth Ward, it was the neighborhood of choice for wealthy merchants, doctors, attorneys, and others. It was also home to numerous churches, making it the center of influence for religious matters. However, as the trolley lines extended, people began moving out to the suburbs and the Fourth Ward suffered from a loss of population. Buildings became dilapidated and crime rose in the area. However, concerned citizens began to reinvigorate and area by the late 1970s and, today, the Fourth Ward neighborhood of Charlotte is one of the most desirable. And while the beautiful Victorian homes are still here and the historic churches still operate, the area has also become home to modern apartments and condominiums, making it a truly diverse place to live. The region is also home to the city's performing arts district, including the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center, an excellent venue that offers a number of concerts, plays, and Broadway musicals throughout the year. The condominiums and townhouses in the Fourth Ward can cost upward to $2 million or more, but it is the charming older houses that have caused this neighborhood to repeatedly be voted one of the best walking'' areas in Charlotte. Indeed, a walking tour of the community provides visitors with a look at some of the loveliest buildings and homes in the city. These include the North Carolina Medical College Building, constructed in 1907 of red brick with stamped metal trim and used as a hotel after the college closed; the Liddell-McNinch House, a Victorian with shingle-style and Queen Anne influences that was home to local industrialist, Vinton Liddell; the 1931 Frederick Apartments, known for the structure's elaborate use of terra cotta decoration; the Bagley-Mullen House, the best example of brick Queen Anne-style architecture in the city; and the stunning First Presbyterian Church, still the religious centerpiece of the city, built in Gothic Revival style in the mid 1800s. Other locations not to miss include the Settlers' Cemetery, opened in the 1770s and the burial place of many early settlers and war heroes. Also in the Fourth Ward is the Charlotte Cotton Mill Complex, the first successful textile plant in the city. A great time to visit the Fourth Ward neighborhood of Charlotte is during the annual Holiday Home Tour. A much-anticipated event for more than 30 years, this holiday happening includes tours of 7 private homes and the Presbyterian Church, all decorated for the holidays.

Overseen by the Wilmington Historic Preservation Commission and the Historic Wilmington Foundation, the neighborhood has long retained its architectural charm and integrity and continues to be one of the top tourist attractions along the southern North Carolina coast. Just minutes from the state's beaches, the historic district of Wilmington is often visited by those heading to the shore. A stroll around this part of the city is delightful just about any time of the year, but particularly picturesque during the spring, when flowers and trees are awash with new color. Most of the streets are shady, with large moss-covered trees that form a promenade down each avenue and many of the charming, older homes boast lovely gardens that are well tended. Visitors will find a huge variety of homes in the historic district but the most popular are the antebellum beauties that line many of the streets in this part of town. Built in a variety of styles, these grand homes are usually privately owned but passers-by are generally free to take photos without permission of the owners. Some are open for tours, such as the historic Bellamy Mansion, which now plays host to a Museum of History and Design Arts.

The arboretum is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Bent Creek stream runs through the center of the property, making it especially picturesque. The 434-acre garden focuses on the education, economic development, research, conservation, and garden demonstration with respect to landscape, architecture, and plant sciences.'' As part of this mission, the arboretum regularly offers classes, workshops, and educational programs for all ages in a variety of subjects dealing with gardening and horticulture. Several gardens can currently be explored at the North Carolina Arboretum though the attraction is not yet complete so more may be added in the future. Currently, the gardens available for viewing include the Blue Ridge Quilt Garden, an area arranged in the Kaleidoscope Quilt block pattern, a nod to the rich crafting heritage of the Blue Ridge Mountain communities. The Dickinson Holly Garden features a variety of native and non-native hollies, while the Heritage Garden showcases plants used in the multi-million dollar craft industry in the area. The National Native Azalea Repository includes nearly every species of this colorful flowering plant native to the United States. Two trails loop through this garden, the perfect place for a leisurely stroll. In addition, the Plants of Promise Garden features plants that show promise for use in the gardens of Southern Appalachia. Local gardeners and home owners can visit to garner ideas for their own creations. New plants are constantly introduced. Also, the Stream Garden, one of three planned demonstration gardens, shows how indigenous and non-native plants can be used in landscape design. The French Broad River Watershed Education and Training Center is also located on the grounds of the North Carolina Arboretum. It provides educational programming and demonstration projects on low impact development, storm water and sediment, and erosion control practices pertinent to the region. Most are open to the public. The arboretum's Bonsai Collection features 100 display specimens and many more in various stages of development. This unique garden, located in the onsite greenhouse, is open to the public with limited hours. The North Carolina Arboretum also has an excellent collection of art works, located in the Education Center, the main gardens, and the Bonsai garden. An ArtWalk brochure, available at the entrance to the arboretum, provides a guide to the pieces of art in the facility's permanent collection. The arboretum also sponsors temporary art exhibits from time to time. The North Carolina Arboretum is open daily year-round except for Christmas Day. Admission fees include a self-guided tour but visitors can also purchase a Segway tour for an additional cost. Youth can enjoy spring break and summer camps at the arboretum for a reasonable cost.

"The Wilmingtonian","North-Carolina","The Wilmingtonian, Wilmington, NC","Wilmington, North Carolina received its name because of an English Earl, Spencer Compton. His official title was Earl of Wilmington and he was considered a patron of the state's Governor. Wilmington became a city in 1739 and was the county seat of New Hanover. Wilmington boasts elegant homes and beautiful boulevards. Although the population is approximately 82,000 people those numbers swell with visitors and college students. Wilmington's surroundings captured the attention of Hollywood, and Screen Gems Studio built a facility for making motion pictures and television shows. Today it is one of the attractions that can be visited. Downtown Wilmington is a historic district with many fine nineteenth century homes, and The Wilmingtonian sits amidst this splendor. The hotel consists of five buildings, many of them historic. The oldest was built in 1841 as a private mansion. This dignified mansion is named the de Rosset house. The Dram Tree house is the second oldest home in the complex, built in approximately 1904. All of the buildings have been returned to their former glory. The newer buildings have the same charm with modern amenities. A true southern experience with the balconies and courtyards to relax in, vacationers or business travelers will enjoy the service and facilities. The Wilmingtonian is considered a boutique hotel'' joining the charm of a bed and breakfast with excellent modern conveniences. The hotel invites guests to relax in the many rockers that dot the balconies. The suites at the Wilmingtonian offer their guests comfortable beds, cable television and alarm clocks.

"Tiger's Eye Golf Links at Ocean Ridge Plantation","North-Carolina","Tiger's Eye Golf Links at Ocean Ridge Plantation, Sunset Beach, North Carolina- The Crown Jewel of the Plantation's Four Golf Courses","Tiger's Eye Golf Links is one of four courses at the Ocean Ridge Plantation, but it's considered the crown jewel'' of the resort and the course that golfers typically come to see and play. Golf Digest ranked the course among the Top 100 Courses in America 2007-2008. The layout is said to be one of the best in the North Strand, and runs through coastal property and virgin pine forest. The course also contains elevation changes of up to 65 feet, which is considered a lot for the area. Some reviewers have described the course as a stunning combination of North Carolina's Sandhills, native grasses, natural waste areas, pine and oak trees, wildflowers, as well as water from marshlands and even waterfalls. The Tim Cate's layout pieces together a traditionally designed links course, with giant coquina boulders and wall-to-wall concrete paths. There's also an abundance of flowers on the course, which has been called the Caledonia of the north,'' and people are said to stop by just to look at all the blooms or to listen to the waterfall at the 18th hole. The 18-hole, par-72 course opened in 2000, and plays to 7,014 yards from the longest Saber Tooth'' tees, with a USGA rating of 73.5 and a slope rating of 144 on Bermuda grass with rye overseen fairways and Bent grass greens. The greens are where much of the difficulty can be found on this course, as the putting surfaces have virtually no flat spots and can be ridiculously undulating at times. Water comes into play on 13 of the holes, and hazards have been placed primarily on the right side of both fairways and greens, which can make for a long day for golfers with a right-hand fade or slice. Fairway landing areas tend to be huge, but at times the layout employs some visual deception that can force golfers to plan their shots like moves on a chessboard. The par-4s on this course have been described as manageable,'' but it's the par-3s that have been called knee knockers.'' Hole No. 2 is a prime example. The hole only plays to 190 yards from the longest tees, 150 from the Whites, but it's perhaps the most difficult one-shotter on the course. It's all carry over a long water hazard to a slightly elevated green guarded by two large bunkers at the front left. Hole No. 11 is another par-3 that calls for some steely nerves. The hole only plays to 165 yards from the longest tees, but tee shots must find an island green that ends with a large sand bunker at its tip. What makes this hole even more daunting is when the coastal breeze is playing toward the tee box, which can make the hole play two clubs longer than normal. Hole No. 17 is the last of the par-3s, but can be just as intimidating. The hole plays to 208 yards from the back tees and 165 yards from the Whites, and is shaped roughly like an elongated figure-8, with water hazards pinching in from both sides. To further complicate matters, the green is guarded by two large bunkers on the right front, which is the bailout area from the water to the left. The resort also features practice facilities, including The Golf Academy at Ocean Ridge. And there's also a full-service golf shop."

"Tryon Palace Historic Sites & Gardens","North-Carolina","Tryon Palace Historic Sites & Gardens - New Bern, NC - Historic Governor's Palace and 13 Gardens","Originally built between 1767 and 1770, Tryon Palace was meant to be the home of the Royal Governor and his family. It was also the first capitol of North Carolina. The Palace was designed in a Georgian style by John Hawks for Governor William Tryon. Rich in history, in 1791, the Palace was the site of a dancing assembly and dinner held in honor of President George Washington. After Raleigh became the capital of North Carolina in 1794, Palace space was rented out to several different entities, including a private school, a boarding house, an a Masonic lodge. In 1978, a fire destroyed much of the main building, but the Kitchen and Stable Offices were not destroyed. Early in the 19th century, the Kitchen Office was demolished. The Stable Office managed to survive. Over the years, many changes were made to the area. A movement began in the 1930s that sought for restoration of the Palace. Nearly two decades later, the Palace restoration began. In April of 1959, the Palace was opened to the public. Currently, both floors of the Palace are open to the public, as is the cellar. Dressed in clothing from the original period, guides now conduct tours of the building. Palace furnishings are primarily English. Governor Tryon made a list of his possessions following the fire, and this detailed list was used as a guide when the Palace was reconstructed and refurbished. The Kitchen Office and Stable Office were reconstructed with guidance from John Hawks' 1767 architectural plans. Today, visitors can experience the sounds and sights of what was considered a modern kitchen in the 18th century. Craftspeople invite visitors to try ironing, spinning, and weaving. Craftspeople also demonstrate how household chores were done in the 1700s. The Stable Office is the only part that remains of the original Palace complex. During restoration, several parts of the Stable Office were replaced or removed, but roughly 75% of the original brickwork remains. The Palace features several collections. Paintings, ceramics, silver, glass, furniture, paper, and other objects are displayed. The Palace also features two galleries with objects d'art. In addition to the Palace itself, the area around the Palace includes 14 acres of gardens. No one can be certain about what the original Palace Gardens looked like, as at least three different garden plans have been discovered. As a result, the current gardens are not based on any of the historic plans. Instead, Morley Williams designed the gardens when the Palace was restored. The design of the gardens is in the colonial revival style, which was popular in the middle of the 20th century. The Palace Gardens are actually made up of 13 different gardens. The Kitchen Garden is behind the Kitchen Office and includes different varieties of 18th century vegetables, fruit trees, and herbs. The Kellenberger Garden is a walled garden. The Wilderness Garden is located south of the Palace, and the Latham Garden is a formal garden. The Green Garden is in a small enclosed space and was designed for the private use of the family whereas the Stanley House Garden is home to two reproductions of summer houses. The Carraway Garden is located behind the Visitor Center and is a parterre garden. The Commission House Harden is a Victorian garden while the Pleached Allye Garden features yaupon holly that has been pleached across the top of the walkway. Named after the Palace architect, John Hawks, Hawks Allye Garden features Italian statues that are surrounded by flowers. Surrounded by a white picket fence, the Stoney Flower Garden is behind the Carraway Garden and features antique roses and old-fashioned perennials. The Tyler Garden is home to a mixture of beds that are similar to the New Bern gardens of the mid 19th century. As a more practical garden, the Hay House includes vegetables, herbs, and fruits that were likely to be grown for food or medicinal purposes. Tryon Palace Historic Sites and Gardens is located at 610 Pollock Street in New Bern, North Carolina. Hours and ticket pricing vary based on which areas are being visited and what season it is. Additional information on ticket pricing and hours can be obtained by calling 800-767-1560 or 252-514-4900."
"Tube World","North-Carolina","Tube World - Maggie Valley, NC - Snow Tube Park","Tube World is located off of Highway 19 in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. Tube World works in association with Cataloochee Ski Area. It is a snow tube park that utilizes Cataloochee's snowmaking expertise. The park offers 5 different runs. Snow is created through two different devices. The first uses water and compressed air to spray a mist on the ground, which will freeze and turn into snow before it settles on the ground. The other is a big gun that is a funnel in shape and has a large, jet like fan that shoot snow at a rate of up to 80 gallons of water a minute and at a distance of over 50 yards. The snow makers of Cataloochee are constantly upgrading equipment and water capacity so all that is needed for excellent tubing conditions is just a cold night. Optimal weather for creating snow are dry, cold days. Making the right snow depends on temperatures and humidity. The park is open from December through March, with varying hours. Some days are 10 AM to 6 PM, some are 4 PM to 10 PM and some are 10 AM to 10 PM. Tube World also provides visitors with the latest snow conditions as well as a web cam of their park so visitors can be prepared before arriving. The run works by having guests take a moving carpet lift to the top of the hill and then sliding down to the bottom. Tubers are expected to ride head first on their stomachs. It does allow riders to slow themselves by dragging their feet, but it some former tubers felt it wasn't the safest way to hit the sandbags at the bottom of the run. No outside tubes, sleds, or other devices are permitted in the park and all tubers must slide individually. Each guest must purchase a ticket. Tickets are priced per session. For those guests who do not meet the height requirements of 42 inches, a Wee Bowl Snow play area has been added. However, Wee Bowl is open only a limited basis so it is best to call ahead and confirm. There is a nominal fee for the Wee Bowl area. Tubing sessions are available on a first come, first served basis. Each session is one hour and forty-five minutes and they start every two hours. It is possible that a session will sell out, so it may be a good idea to arrive prior to the session you wish to attend. If the session is sold out, visitors may purchase a session for later in the day if space is available. Guests who have been to Tube World recommend arriving first thing in the morning to buy tickets for later in the day or trying to by them a day in advance. Alley Cat Photos provides pictures of the guests' day on the slopes. Pictures are available online from that day, as well as prior weeks and months. Customers do have mixed reviews on the park. Some guests had a wonderful time and had no problems at all when visiting this attraction. They believed that the price was fair and would go back. Other guests felt that the people who work there were not well informed and did not provide helpful information. Many had trouble getting tickets and once they did felt that the experience was not worth it for the price they had paid."
"Tweetsie Railroad","North-Carolina","Tweetsie Railroad - Blowing Rock, North Carolina - Rail Museum and Family Theme Park","Tweetsie Railroad is a Wild West style family theme park located in Tweetsie Railroad Lane, between Boone and Blowing Rock, North Carolina. It is open seven days a week between May 23 and August 23, and Friday, Saturday and Sunday during the rest of the year. The park also holds specials events on July 4th, Labor Day and in the month leading up to Halloween. The Tweetsie Railroad began operations in 1882 as 32 mile track running between Tennessee and North Carolina via the Blue Ridge chain of the Appalachian Mountains. The railroad was named Tweetsie'' by local residents after hearing the tweet tweet'' whistling sound of the trains running along the track. The trains were also called Tweetsie locomotives. Changing times reduced the necessity for the railroad by the mid 20th century and it ceased to be commercially viable. However, one of the locomotives was revived and in 1957 it ran again to become a tourist attraction. The Tweetsie locomotive now makes scenic journeys carrying passengers three miles through the mountains at Blowing Rock. As well as the views, the train ride has action along the way with Cowboys providing entertainment alongside the tracks. A variety of entertainment is provided at the site with live music, can-can girls and a 1800s saloon show all recreating the country and western feel. For the smaller children there is a musical show presented by a puppet rabbit and tortoise, which tells how they keep the train moving on time. Aside from the trips on the historic locomotive, there are many rides to try out in the fun fair. There are rides with varying degrees of thrills with some such as the Free Fall, Tornado and Round Up having warnings that they are not suitable for pregnant ladies or people with heart conditions. These also have minimum height restrictions too, whereas others are suitable for smaller kids if accompanied by an adult. Some of the more traditional rides are there too, such as the Carousel and Ferris wheel. Visitors can also take a ride on the chair lift up to Miner's Mountain, where there is the promise of more fun for kids of all ages including a magic show. Several shops are open for visitors to purchase souvenirs and even Miner's hats, Cowboy and Indian costumes and many other items There are plenty of areas at the site to buy food and drink, catering for sit down hot meals or just snacks and drinks. Given 24 hours notice the staff will prepare box lunches for groups of 20 or more, and have it ready for whatever time is specified. As an addendum a company picnic package can be arranged for groups of 100 or more, whereby guests can eat and drink as much as they like from a choice of menus. Previous visitors' reviews of Tweetsie Railroad are generally very favourable. It seems to be a great place to take children, although for older kids 10 and over the historical content may be more useful for school projects. Parents seem to be going back with their kids where they were once taken in their own childhood years, so it is crossing the generations."
"U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, NC a Treat for Water Lovers","North-Carolina","U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, NC a Treat for Water Lovers","	Founded in August 2006, the U.S. National Whitewater Center (USNWC) in Charlotte, North Carolina is a 307-acre outdoor recreation and environmental education center. Originally designated as a center for kayaking, rafting, and canoeing, it has now expanded to include areas when visitors can practice other outdoor sports as well. Located 10 minutes from downtown Charlotte along the Catawba River, the U.S. National Whitewater Center was inspired by the success of similar areas built for use in the Summer Olympics of 2000 and 2004. Now designated as a training site for various U.S. Olympic teams, the USNWC is currently home to the only multi-channel re-circulating whitewater river in the world. Indeed, this whitewater river remains the centerpiece of the National Whitewater Center and a number of different adventures can be enjoyed on this body of water. Whitewater rafting is probably the most popular and can be arranged to suit a variety of ages and skill levels. The river presents an opportunity to challenge rapids that range from Class II to Class IV. Rafters begin by paddling through the wilderness'' section of the course and then the competition channel. After a run down that channel, a conveyor belt takes the raft up to the upper pond for another challenge. Levels are broken into three categories: Family Rafting, which is a more relaxed ride designed with younger and less experienced riders in mind; Adventure Rafting, an opportunity to run all the channels at the facility, open to ages 11 and up; and Rodeo Rafting, the toughest challenge of all, which includes the use of 10 foot rafts and expert guides who can instruct paddlers on the toughest portions of the river. Whitewater kayakers can run the same rapids or take advantage of kayak instruction provided by several experts in the field. Flatwater kayaking is also available on the 1.5 acres of the Catawba River that skirt the USNWC property. Two-hour guided tours are available as well. The Center also functions as a training facility for swift-water rescue and has hosted myriad fire departments, rescue squads, military personnel, government agencies, and recreational paddlers interested in learning the particulars of water rescue in similar conditions. Outside of water activities, an all day pass at USNWC allows patrons to try their hand at land-based activities including climbing on more than 5,700 square feet of diverse climbing surfaces, and more than 40 roped climbs. Instructors teach belaying, climbing, rapelling, and bouldering. A zip line and high rope course is also available at selected times and 11 miles of trails are offering for biking, hiking, or running. Leashed dogs are welcome on the trails. Children and adults will also enjoy the eco caching program at the U.S. National Whitewater Center near Charlotte.

"Umstead State Park","North-Carolina","Umstead State Park, Raleigh, NC","Umstead State Park was founded in 1934 as a recreational park. The Resettlement Administration purchased 5,000 acres to develop. Over the next three years picnic facilities were constructed, along with roadways. The park officially opened to the public in 1937, with camping areas. Needing more land, the state decided to purchase Crabtree Creek Recreation Area to build more facilities for park goers. In 1940 the recreation park became a state park. By the 1950's, another 1,000 acres was added. The additional 1,000 acres was used as a park for African American individuals, since it was a time of segregation in the Southern states. The African American section was called Reedy State Park. Crabtree Park Recreation was renamed William Bradley Umstead, a couple years after the addition of Reedy State Park. In 1960 both parks were united, keeping the Umstead name. Today William B. Umstead State park is 5, 579 acres. It sits between Raleigh, Cary, and Durham North Carolina in Wake County. The cities unite to make the Research Triangle Park, a location known for its businesses, financial district, and colleges. Umstead State Park is an oasis in the middle of professional and financial development. The park offers hiking trails, bike trails, boat rentals, camping, and programs for educational purposes. William B. Umstead Park opens each day at 7am during the summer months for trail access. Other gates do not open until 8am. All gates will close between 6pm and 9pm depending on the time of year.

"UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens","North-Carolina","UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens","The University of North Carolina at Charlotte Botanical Gardens is an oasis of plants, flowers, and trees. The botanical garden has a mission and desire to share the world of plants with people. It is a university garden that promotes knowledge and appreciation for plants. UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens focuses on the positive environmental, educational, and aesthetic impact plants bring to the world. The garden started in the 1960's by a biology professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. He garnered the financial support from local Charlotte residents to create a living classroom for field-based biology courses that would be taught at the school. The professor had plans to make the garden a horticultural resource for the general public. With the help and financial support of the community, the biology professor was able to create a greenhouse and ten acres of outdoor gardens. The UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens is composed of three main areas - the Susie Harwood Garden, Van Landingham Glen area, and the McMillan Greenhouse Complex. The Susie Harwood Garden contains winter-blooming plants, flowering trees, azaleas, Japanese maples, perennials, spring bulbs, and water plants. A mosaic patio and Asian Garden can also be found in the Susie Harwood Garden. The McMillan Greenhouse contains exotic flowers and plants all year round. Orchids, carnivorous plants, fruits and spice plants, desert plans, tropical vines, flowers, ferns, and shrubs have all made their home in the greenhouse. The Final area, Van Landingham Glen has a focus on wildflowers and rhododendrons. The garden is in a wooded atmosphere and has a large extension of native plants that can be viewed in any season. All three areas are located on the east side of the University of North Carolina college campus. Each area has something unique for visitors to learn about and see. Visitors to the UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens learn about botany and horticulture in a tranquil setting. The gardens are open to the public and there are no admission fees to enter but donations are encouraged. A donation box is located at the greenhouse entrance under the visitor sign-in. The outdoor gardens are open all week long during the daylight hours. The McMillan Greenhouse is open Monday through Saturday from 10AM to 3PM and Sundays from 1 to 4PM. Guided tours are available for groups of at least seven kids or adults. All guided tours must be scheduled at least two weeks in advance so the staff can have time to make preparations. The fee for a guided tour is $3 per person. The tours can last anywhere from half an hour to a full hour depending on what parts of the garden the group desires to explore. One of the best features of UNC Charlotte Botanical Gardens is that visitors have the option of taking a piece of the garden home with them for a fee. Plants from the permanent collections are not sold to the public, but the botanical garden often has a small selection of plants for purchase through out the year. Three times a year, the garden has larger plant sales."

"Webbley","North-Carolina","Webbley - Shelby, NC - Restored Historical Home of Shelby Political Dynasty","Located about forty-five miles outside of Charlotte, Shelby North Carolina has a rich historical district and is home to one of the most historical residences in the state. Webbley, also known as the O. Max Gardner house, was the setting for the one of the state's most celebrated political dynasties and home generations of Shelby residents. Built sometime around 1852 to 1855 the original core of the house is two stories and stands out as a example of the grandeur and grace of the Old South's architecture. The house faces what is Washington Street in the Central Shelby Historic District. Shelby attorney, Augustus W. Burton was the builder and original owner of the house. He shortly sold the house and it changed many hands for the next fifty years. In 1905 J.A. Anthony a prominent local attorney bought the house and along with his wife, Ollie Gardner Anthony, initiated a drastic renovation of the house. The Colonial Revival drastically changed the appearance of the house to what it looks like today. The lot size of the house had been dramatically decreased as the city of Shelby grew around it. They also added on to the house increasing its size from the core construction done in the 1850s. Anthony's brother in-law and business partner was Oliver Maxwell Gardner, who had married into the politically influential Webb family. Gardner not only was a lawyer but also owned a farm, the Shelby cloth mill and Gardner Land Company. In 1911, Gardner's father-in-law, Judge James L. Webb bought the house from Anthony. He moved his family and the Gardners in, and the locals quickly started calling the house Webbley. Gardner, who was raised on a farm, insisted on instilling a hard ethic on his children. Despite their wealth he made them herd cows from their farm through Shelby to the Webbley, which embarrassed them greatly. Despite their political power and large estate the Gardners held onto their farming roots. Gardner entered politics by becoming state senator in 1910. After a litany of other offices he was elected as the Democratic governor for North Carolina in 1928, despite the beginning of the Great Depression and a nation wide dislike of the democrats. He initiated programs insuring the protection of small farmers, with whom he sympathized. He went to Washington where he was chairman of the Advisory Board of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion, Undersecretary of the Treasury and ambassador to the United Kingdom. He died during the last appointment. Webbley remained in the family and was turned into a bed and breakfast in 1993. Due to an illness in the family in 1998 the house was converted back to private use. Its significance goes beyond that of a North Carolina political dynasty. Thomas Dixon used Webbley as inspiration in his 1905 novel, The Clansman. The home was also used as a real life model in the movie based on the novel, the seminal 1915 Birth of a Nation. The house is located at 403 S. Washington St. and is available for public viewing Monday -Friday 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Webbley is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places"
"Western North Carolina Nature Center","North-Carolina","Western North Carolina Nature Center - Asheville, North Carolina - small public zoo and nature center","The Western North Carolina Nature Center in Asheville, North Carolina is a small public zoo and nature center founded in 1973. The initial funding for the zoo, originally called the Children's Zoo and Nature Center, was raised by the Junior League. An initial $25,000 donation provided the impetus to raise the remainder of the construction money, which cost was significantly defrayed by the contribution of services from the Asheville Building and Trades Council. Many area businesses also contributed building materials, making the Children's Zoo and Nature Center a true community project. The Nature Center is still managed by the Friends of the WNC Nature Center, which was formed in 1975 as The Nature Society. The Nature Society worked with the staff of the budding Nature Center to come up with a mission - to educate the public to the natural history and ecology of the Southern Appalachian. The new Children's Zoo and Nature Center opened in 1977 on the site of the old Children's Zoo, though the site was completely unrecognizable. The cages and buildings were gone, replaced with natural and naturalistic habitats that were ahead of their time in animal care. Over time, the Nature Center became a sanctuary for injured wildlife, wild animals who had been pets or who had been raised as part of animal reintroduction programs. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Nature Center broke ground on yet another ambitious project - the Predator Habitat Project which reintroduced a breeding pair of red wolves into a habitat built specifically for red and gray wolves. In the mid-1990s, a second phase of the Predator Habitat was completed with habitats for cougars and bobcats. In addition to the conservation projects, the WNC Nature Center opened other projects aimed at entertainment and education for children and other area residents. Those include a hands-on nature lab, where children are encouraged to indulge in the kinds of things that kids love to do - hold turtles, stroke corn snakes and get to know animals up close and personal. The WNC Nature Center is committed to education for children and adults. Over 30,000 schoolchildren visit the Nature Center over the course of a school year, participating in various programs offered by the Center staff. Summertime features at the zoo include Zoo Camp for children and a Youth Naturalist program for area youth. The Center is also available for private events such as birthday parties and sleepovers, as well as offering fun, recurring events like the Wolf Howl.

"Whiteside Mountain","North-Carolina","Whiteside Mountain - Highlands, NC - Sheer White Cliffs Offer Hiking and Climbing","In southeast North Carolina the Nantahala National Forest offers many natural sights and attractions, most notably Whiteside Mountain. Located a few miles from Highlands, NC on Highway 64 the mountain is a popular landmark and iconic representation of the Appalachian Mountains and eastern Continental Divide. Take Highway 64 east for 5 miles from Highlands and turn right on SR 1680 and simply follow the signs. The sheer white cliffs of Whiteside are 750 feet tall, and are the largest sheer cliffs in the Eastern U.S. The area is pivotal in Native American folklore. The Cherokee believe that the giant monster Spearfish lived on the mountaintop and the sheered off cliffs were created when a bridge to her lair collapsed. Ancient hunting camps can be found all around the mountain. The mountain itself is estimated to be over four hundred million years old by geologists and is sure to keep any rock hound intrigued. The mountain is now a Mecca for hikers in the area, offering a two-mile loop, which ends at the 4,930-foot summit. For the daily admission of $2 or a season pass of $15 hikers can take the trails up and around the mountain to enjoy the great views of the surrounding forests and other peaks in the mountain chain. An old growth forest at the top of the mountain is a hiker favorite. Wind, rain and ice have twisted the trunks of the northern red oaks making for a very interesting sight. Besides hikers, the sheer cliffs attract mountain climbers. The unique mountain geography is rare in that part of the country and allows experienced mountain climbers challenges normally found in the western United States and Rockies. The cliffs sheer faces are not for the weak of heart and even some of the more experienced climbers in the country opt to tackle more forgiving mountains in the area. Other professional climbers have mapped out routes and ample resources and guides are available for climbing tips. For those not that experienced to climb the face of the cliffs, a favorite past time is to hike to the summit and repel down the face of the cliffs. Of course this should only be attempted with the proper training, guides and equipment. Climbers are prohibited from scaling or repelling down the cliffs during certain parts of the year due to concerns over interfering in the nesting season of the Peregrine falcon. The bird is an endangered species and was reintroduced to the area back in 1985 by biologists and wildlife experts to slowly build the population back up. Make sure to contact the local park ranger in order to find out when climbing is allowed. Besides unique wildlife like the falcon, the mountain is home to a wide variety of plant life and flowers. Hikers have commented on the beauty of the flowering forest during springtime, and recommend planning your trip for around it. Wildflowers like the speckled wood-lily, white snakeroot, brighten the forest floor. Other flowers like the dwarf dandelion and grey beard tongue have adapted to bloom on the mountain face itself. This colorful spectacle is a favorite amongst hikers and mounting climbers a like."
