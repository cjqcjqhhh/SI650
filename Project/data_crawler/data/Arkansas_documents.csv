Opening hours are 11am to 4.30 pm Sunday to Friday and 10am to 4.30pm Saturdays with the museum remaining closed on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The museum first opened to the public in 1986 in one of the few remaining all wooden hangars from the Second World War era. It is now the largest air museum in Arkansas and was built as a tribute to the state's rich aviation history as well as coinciding with the 150th anniversary of statehood. Nowadays the museum provides a history of manned flight with of course its aircraft, engines, artifacts and exhibits. Many of the aircraft housed here are still airworthy with examples dating from both World Wars, Vietnam, the Apollo rockets and much more. The collection here is always rotating as the aircraft are owned by private collectors and taken to air shows across the country. Therefore, no guarantees can be made about which aircraft visitors will see when they visit the museum. One of those planes seen at air shows around the country is the LearJet 23, which was built in 1964 and is perhaps one the most modern craft to be seen here, along with 1960s helicopters. The Stinson S Junior is one of the older planes on display here and was built around 1928, and visitors can also see the Boeing-Stearman plane that helped trained U.S pilots during World War II. There is also an international presence here with a replica of an early British plane used in World War I. There are many more examples of aircraft at the museum as well as rare engines that are workshop mounted and fully accessible, including some special manufacturer's cutaways that show the inner working. Here visitors will see examples of aircraft engines such as the Allison J3, which is a direct descendant of the famous jet engine design of Frank Whittle. Also there is a Rolls Royce engine, the Double Wasp, the X-Power from the 1950s and a rocket engine design that was part of the Saturn booster program in the race to the moon.

Some of the exhibits are about personal achievements in aviation history such as that of Louise Thaden, who was the first woman to win major flying events, whilst another is about a local hero Richard Covey, who took part in shuttle missions.

For both adults and children the Center hosts a museum school, which teaches arts and artistic crafts of all kinds. Metal working, pottery, watercolor - there are programs on nearly every art form. Some take the form of long classes, while others are one day seminars with guest artists. Advance registration is needed for many of the classes, which are usually held on the grounds.

The first documented diamond found here was in 1906 by John Huddleston, who owned the property at the time. Over the next seven decades the property changed hands several times and hosted many failed mining ventures. It became a state park in 1972, but has been open to the public since around 1910.

The tools needed to mine diamonds are very simple and readily available. Visitors have the choice of bringing their own tools or renting them from the gift shop in the visitor's center. The tools needed include a small shovel, wooden box, a screen, a bucket and a trowel. Knee pads are also a good idea. These can be rented from the gift shop for a small fee and deposit. The hours of the park are a bit complicated, so it is a good idea to call ahead to check the schedule as the hours vary by season. Organized groups wanting to visit the park will find that calling ahead could net a half price discount, depending on the season. It is very cheap to visit and hunt for diamonds, although no promises of discovery are made.

Other park attractions include hiking trails, wildlife observation blind, camping sites, a pavilion, the Kimberlite Cafy Restaurant, and a water park. Most of these attractions, including the restaurant, are seasonally operated. For reservations, hours and group pricing call the visitor's center at (870) 288-3113."

"Arrowhead Crystal Mine - Mount Ida AK Arrowhead Crystal Mine public fee mining","Arkansas","Arrowhead Crystal Mine - Mount Ida AK Arrowhead Crystal Mine public fee mining","Privately owned, the Arrowhead Crystal Mine is just outside the city of Mount Ida. The crystal mine has produced several award winning specimens. Finds include clear point quartz, Blue Phantom, and all kinds of hued crystals. The most popular part of the mine is the fee digging section. The pricing does get a bit complicated, however. There is a standard base fee of $20.00 per person over the age of nine years old, and children under age nine can dig for free if they are accompanied by a paying adult. On top of the base fee this organization offers four digging packages that start at $100.00, depending on what buyers would like to do. Arrowhead Crystal Mine does not rent tools, as guests are encouraged to bring their own. The tools needed include a flathead screwdriver, long crowbars, three pound hand mallet, two or three inch wide tip chisels with hand guards, small garden tools, rock picks, and safety glasses. It is also recommended that visitors wear old clothes and gloves. Crystals can be sharp and flying splinters have been known to cut guests. The gloves and safety glasses will protect hands and eyes from accidents. The mine is open all year round, weather permitting, and the road sign has a portion that will inform visitors if the property is open or closed. The road leading to the mine is passable for most passenger cars, but it is a gravel road, so compact cars might encounter some difficulty. Visitors to this establishment say the staff is quite knowledgeable and responsive to questions. The crystals are plentiful, although most are small to medium in size. Large crystals can be found as well, and the policy of this company is finder's keepers, up to whatever can be found and transported during a visit. In addition to the fee digging they offer both wholesale and retail crystal sales. Calling in advance for pricing and hours is highly recommended since Arrowhead Crystal Mine does not have set operating hours. For more information call (870) 326-4443 or (501) 538-9627."

The Aviation Cadet Museum in Eureka Springs, AR, contains many exhibits that point to the history of those cadets who learned to fly here. Cadets would come from all over to the area to learn to fly. At the same time, they were also being trained to be officers. They would become part of the Army Air Corps, which is what the Air Force was called in those days. The training program was started in 1917, and nearly all of the men who flew in the military were trained here. Many pilots who were in the armed services of our Allies were also trained here. Altogether there were 325,000 men who had completed the program. The last pilot to go through and complete the training was graduated in 1961; then, he finally retired from the military as recently as 1998. The museum was opened by Beth and Errol Severe. He had been trained at the Vance Air Force Base nearby and was a pilot, flying on the KC-97 tankers. He had also flown as officer and ultimately as captain of commercial airliners. He retired in 1985. Errol has also written a book about the pilot training program called The Last of a Breed.''

"Bathhouse Row","Arkansas","Bathhouse Row, Hot Springs National Park, AR - Park","While you are visiting in the Hot Springs area, you will want to stop by the Bathhouse Row in Hot Springs National Park, AR. This well-preserved historic landmark has been the place where millions of people came for centuries to get relief and healing from many different ailments. The Indians were certainly avid users of the natural healing powers of the hot springs, which are warmed up to 143 degrees. Prior to the invention of modern medicine, this was one of the most effective and favorite methods of getting the needed relief. Some of the more famous guests to the bathhouses include famous people such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Babe Ruth. It seems that the gangster Al Capone also loved to come here. In order to accommodate the people that wanted to enjoy the healing powers of the waters, many bathhouses were built here. Each one often had its own architectural style and it may have been totally different than the one right next door. Visitors can see bathhouses that were designed and built in Spanish, Italianate, neoclassical, and renaissance-revival styles. Altogether, eight large bathhouses were built, but only one is still operational today - the Buckstaff. Wanting to preserve the benefit of the natural Hot Springs for future generations, the US Government obtained the area as the first Federal Reserve in 1832. At that time, there were 47 natural hot springs that did not have the typical sulfur smell of many other hot springs. Visitors now can visit the Park and see the magnificent buildings, which are well cared for. One of them, the Fordyce, now serves as the Visitor Center. It was probably the most luxurious of all of the bathhouses, and this was the goal of the founder - Col. Samuel Fordyce. At that time, it included almost anything that could be desired for health and fun. Inside the luxurious building, there was a gym, a bowling alley, a billiard room, a museum displaying various Indian artifacts, and even a spot on the roof for getting some sun. The luxuriousness of the Fordyce can immediately be seen when you visit the Center. It was built in the Spanish Renaissance Revival style, and marble is used to decorate the halls. There are also cherub fountains, aquatic images in the stained glass, featuring the god of the sea - Neptune, and much more. There is also a hall giving tribute to DeSoto, who first discovered the healing properties of the water and led Europeans there. Not far from the Fordyce, there are two different scenic drives that can be taken to view the park and the Hot Springs Mountain. Either one takes about 45 minutes. The one to Hot Springs Mountain has several parking areas for overlooks and also the Mountain Tower on the summit - all of which offer tremendous views of the area.

"Christ of the Ozarks","Arkansas","Christ of the Ozarks - Eureka Springs AR - Statue Jesus  Christ of the Ozarks","The Christ of the Ozarks is a large sculpture located just outside Eureka Springs. This Christian monument is on the grounds of the Great Passion Play religious theme park. The sculpture is seven stories high. The statue of Jesus stands at an altitude of 1500 feet, meaning that it can easily be seen from the valley below as well as from a number of locations in the surrounding area. As the third largest evangelical statue in the world after the two in South America, Christ of the Ozarks is the work of Emmet Sullivan. Mr. Sullivan was supposedly one of the artisans who helped construct Mount Rushmore, and sculpture buffs may wish to compare the style for similarities. Christ of the Ozarks was dedicated in 1966. Building the structure took two million pounds of mortar and steel. The foundation alone required 340 tons of concrete interlaced with steel to provide a firm enough base to keep the statue upright. The monument was constructed in 24 sections, instead of being poured into one mold, as that would have been a truly heroic engineering feat to even create a mold. Other fun measurements for trivia buffs include that the arm span from fingertip to fingertip reaches 65 feet, the head alone weighs seven and half tons, and the distance on one hand from wrist to fingertip is nearly seven feet. The statue is not universally loved, as some feel that it lacks a certain expressiveness. Compared to other religious sculpture, the features are considered rather hard and harsh with dead'' eyes. Yet for all its perceived chilly personality, visitors flock to the site for pictures. The statue park is open to the public 24 hours a day, seven days a week, year round. Admission is free, although to protect the solitude of the monument and the surrounding park land the parking area is a bit distant. However, those with mobility struggles should not that tThe walkway to the statue is a gently sloping paved area."

"Gangster Museum of America","Arkansas","Gangster Museum of America, Hot Springs, AR","There is something about gangsters that always draws our attention. It doesn't matter if it is a Hollywood depiction of some of the bad men of the late 19th and early 20th century or something else entirely, our appetites will be whetted. The best place for anyone to learn about gangsters is at the Gangster Museum of America in Hot Springs, Arkansas. Hot Springs, Arkansas was a huge draw for gangsters on the East Coast and from Chicago for a number of reasons. However, the history of gangsters in Hot Springs can be placed on one gangster in particular. Owen Oweny the Killer'' Madden owned the Cotton Club in New York. During his life he was arrested and tossed in Sing Sing. Upon being released he found it necessary to seek another place to live due to health reasons. It is the health issues that brought Madden to Hot Springs, Arkansas. It was known since the time of Native Americans to be a special place with healing waters. Once Madden arrived in Hot Springs he began instigating illegal activities with his Southern Club. Even the Mayor McLaughlin was aware of the illegal gambling, but did not stop it. Madden fell in love with the post masters daughter marrying Agnes Demby. Despite claims she was in full awareness of what Madden did and had done. The Gangster Museum is not located in any of the illegal gambling sites of the gangster time period. Instead it is a modest store front that houses a collection of mementoes kept from the early 1900's. Other gangsters to the area that one can learn about at the museum are Lucky Luciano, Al Capone, Bugs Moran, Frank Costello, and Meyer Lansky. Lucky Luciano had to leave New York due to a $12 billion prostitution ring that was uncovered. He was arrested in Hot Springs, but released. Then Thomas Dewey made sure Arkansas arrested him again and extradited him to New York where he was given a 30 to 50 year sentence. Alvin Creepy'' Karpis was once considered the number 1 Public Enemy by J. Edgar Hoover. He hid out in Hot Springs before getting caught in New Orleans. Capone made use of Hot Springs and the surrounding mountains during prohibition. He often stayed at the Arlington Hotel, in room 442 now named Al's Suite. He would come to the Hot Springs to get moonshine for his Chicago place. Bugs Moran was there once during Capone's stay, but he was at the Majestic Hotel. Bugs Moran was Capone's arch enemy. Another establishment in Hot Springs known for illegal activity was the Ohio Club. All of this history and more can be learned when visiting the Gangster Museum of America. They also have Al's Cadillac, which was outfitted with bullet proof materials and later seized. Roosevelt was known to use the Cadi on December 8, 1941. Admission into the museum is $9 for general admission, $8 for seniors, and $4 for children 6 to 12. It is open 10am to 6pm Sunday through Thursday and 10am to 9pm Friday and Saturday."

This visitor attraction is focused around two unusual natural rock formations, the Pivot Rock and the Natural Bridge. Open to the public and visited regularly for the past century, the location has now been registered as a historic site. The Pivot Rock is an unusual formation in that it is upside down''. The bottom of the rock measures two feet by seven feet, but the top is large enough to fit a large SUV or a small RV on it comfortably. From point to table-top, it is taller than an average height male. In contrast the Natural Bridge is relatively small, just large enough for an average size adult to walk underneath if they are bent at the waist. It is just a pretty natural foot bridge, and not blocked off from tourists. Like most places in the Ozarks, there is a legend attached to this area. Unusually, for the Ozarks, this legend has a basis in truth. It is said that the caves and ravines directly around the formations were used by Jesse James and the James-Younger Gang as a hideout. While it has been proven that Jesse James and his gang did frequent the area, it is hard to conclusively say that this exact spot was used as a hideout. The story is useful when motivating reluctant children to visit the park, however. The paths leading to the formations are paved, but can be difficult to navigate for disabled individuals. There is a small fee to visit the site, and it is open in summer, spring, and fall but closed in winter. This area also offers other nature related actives, just as longer hiking trails, fishing, and some educational programs. For more information contact the park's visitor's office at (479) 253-8860."

Visitors driving to the lake should take U.S. 70 four miles west from Glenwood, then Ark. 84 west 21 miles to Athens before turning northwest on Ark. 246 for two miles, and then north for approximately five miles on Forest Service Road 38. The recreation area includes more than 90 campsites, a swimming beach, playground, hiking trails, picnic shelter, a grass boat ramp and other recreational facilities. Camping is restricted six people per site, with a maximum stay of 14 days and RV's and trailers up to 40 feet can be accommodated here.

Game fish found in the lake include largemouth bass, catfish and sunfish species. Daily limits of five catfish and a bass minimum length of 15 inches or longer are enforced here too as the lake has only been stocked since 1998 after dam repair. The lake is also a good place to take the family for a getaway break and relax with a special area roped off for swimming and fishing as well as hiking trails, ping pong and a playground. The lake is part of the Ouachita National Forest, which covers 1.8 million acres in central Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma.

There are designated picnic areas at the campsites but if visitors wish to dine elsewhere due to bad weather for example, then there are some eateries situated in Scott. Cotham's Mercantile is on Highway 161 and serves primarily fried foods: fried green tomatoes, homemade onion rings, chicken fried steak, and the signature Hubcap Hamburgers and Cheeseburgers. The success of the restaurant was said to be as a result of Bill Clinton discovering the Hubcap Hamburgers while serving as Arkansas Governor. There are a number of other attractions in Scott that visitors to the area may like to try, especially if staying at the Shady Lake campsites on a cloudy or wet day. The Plantation Agriculture Museum is at the junction of U.S. 165 and Arkansas 161 and has several exhibits and displays, providing visitors with a detailed history of cotton agriculture practices between 1836 through to World War II.

Admission to the museum is free and they are open Tuesday through Friday from 9 am until 4 pm, Saturday from 10 am until 4 pm, and Sunday from 1 pm until 4 pm. The Tower Building is located in MacArthur Park which is in downtown Little Rock. It was constructed in 1840 as part of Little Rock's first military installation. It has since been the site of two museums, including the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities until 1997, and the MacArthur Museum of Military History, which it has been since 2001. Aside from museums, the park and building have been used for a variety of different things throughout its existence. It was the headquarters of the United Confederate Veterans Reunion in 1911, when over 100,000 Civil War vets gathered together. The area was also a popular camping destination at this time. The building later became the site of the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the top floor was converted to Little Rock's first public library. The Little Rock fire station was built in the park in 1917, and in 1936, a Museum of Fine Arts was created. This building is located south of the Tower Building and is now known as the Arkansas Arts Center. The Tower Building was renovated in 1942 and renamed MacArthur Park as it is known today. It later became a member of the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

The museum also intends to preserve the Tower Building, honor veterans of United States Wars, and have an officially dedicated site for the birthplace of General MacArthur. In addition to the history lessons available in the tower, the site hosts a Murder Mystery Dinner Theatre event that is ongoing. This popular activity is a big draw in Little Rock for those who enjoy hijinks, murder, mayhem, and horror, all while dining on delicious food and enjoying social interaction with others.

The mill is also open on many of the holidays with the exception of Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day, while on Christmas Eve it closes early at 2pm and again on New Year's Eve at 3pm. The mill was initially built in 1832 when Sylvanus Blackburn and his wife Catherine settled in the area and started to plant corn in the creek valley. Given the nearest mill was some 25 miles away in Richand, the couple built their own mill using the War Eagle Creek as its energy source. Subsequently the Blackburn's neighbors brought their corn to the mill for grinding During the lifetime of the Blackburns the mill had quite a lively history, with the initial building washed away by floods in 1848. Then when they evacuated to Texas for four years during the American Civil War, both the Union and the Confederate Armies used the mill to grind grain for food at different times. The mill had to be rebuilt after the war and was completed in 1873 only for it to be burnt down in 1924, where it was left untouched until 1973 when once again a mill was erected using much the same design used over a century before. A big striking feature of the water mill is the waterwheel, which is an eighteen feet cypress waterwheel. This is the only working mill in Arkansas so visitors can see the flour making process and the owners believe it to be the only undershot water wheel currently in operation in the United States. Formal and informal tours are provided at the mill by a member of staff, with information provided about the history of the place and the products made and sold here.
