"A Culture of Eclectic Shopping","Oregon","A Culture of Eclectic Shopping, Liberal Foods, and Artistic Entertainment - Hawthorne District in Portland","Portland has a reputation for its liberal environmentalism, opinionated yet friendly citizens, and passionate love for the arts, and nowhere is this culture more thickly represented than in the avant-garde Hawthorne District. This is one of the most unique and popular places in the Southeast Portland area. While the restaurants and shops give a funky feel to it, the neighborhood is also full of restored old and historical homes, mostly of the bungalow style, that are surrounded by tall trees that line the sidewalks. Visitors can find trendy clothing shops, cafes, antique stores, boutiques, used-clothing stores, and locally-owned restaurants. It's also a fantastic place to get a cold one, as the area is full of fun pubs and breweries. For night-time entertainment, pubs with sidewalk seating offer a pleasurable nightlife. The district is between 17th and 43rd Avenues, across the Willamette River from Downtown. It covers a three-mile stretch. It's not recognized as a single neighborhood, but instead is made up of the Mt. Tabor, Sunnyside, Hosford-Abernathy, Ladd's Addition, and Buckman neighborhoods. There you can find the Hawthorne Bridge, which is the oldest vertical lift bridge that is still in operation in the United States. Another popular landmark is a Portland relic that has been restored by the popular local McMenamins chain, The Bagdad Theater and Pub. McMenamins commonly restores old and historical buildings in Portland, including schools, retirement homes, and theaters, and turns them into a funky gala of art and alchohol. The Bagdad Theater and Pub show second-run movies that visitors can view while sipping McMenamins' famous craft beer. It was put on the National register of Historic Places. Powell's Books, the world-famous city of books that claims to be the largest independent new and used bookstore, has one of its seven locations in the Hawthorne District. Some other popular attractions include the Daily Grind, an incredible bakery and natural foods store, Pastaworks, an Italian grocery store featuring fresh pastas and sauces, Ink and Bread, a northwest-influenced bistro famous for its luscious desserts and Yiddish brunches, and the Lucky Labrador Brew Pub, serving hand-crafted ales and inviting patrons' dogs to stay in the back patio. There are many other restaurants and pubs ranging from thin-curst pizza, to Italian, to sushi. Some of the best places for shopping include the well-known Red Light, full of 70's style used clothing and accessories, Presents of Mind, Imelda's and Louie's Shoes, and Greg's. Visitors and reviewers comment on the laid-back atmosphere of the area and commonly refer to it as Portland's version of Haight Street.'' The fun and vibrant culture of the Hawthorn District is incredibly important to the locals living there. Only a few years ago, residents of the neighborhood and surrounding area organized to keep McDonalds from setting up a franchise in the area. They were successful, and the space is now a set of condos and retail shops. Hopefully the district will always be a unique and eclectic place for culture and enjoyment."
"A Kaleidoscope of Thousands of Roses In the Rose City - International Rose Test Garden","Oregon","A Kaleidoscope of Thousands of Roses In the Rose City - International Rose Test Garden","This five-acre rose garden features fountains, paths, statues, art, tours, a charming gift shop full of rose-related gifts, and - of course - every kind of rose you could possibly imagine. Over 8,000 rose bushes from approximately 550 varieties are available for viewing up-close, creating a kaleidoscope of colors and an intoxicating potpourri of scents. There are climbers, grandifloras, hybrid teas, landscape roses, floribundas, and miniatures, just to name a few of the types of roses in this lush garden. Thousands of visitors come to see and smell the numerous flowers every year. Because it's set in the West Hills above downtown Portland, various places in the garden offer spectacular views, including a nice view of Mt. Hood and the Cascade mountains. In 1905, officials had planted 20 miles of rose-bordered streets in order to draw attention to the Lewis and Clark Centennial Celebration. This earned Portland the name City of Roses.'' A former president of the Portland Rose Society, Jesse A. Currey, rounded up numerous supporters to encourage the city fathers to create a rose test garden. The purpose of the garden was to test new rose varieties, but it must have appealed to city officials as an attraction that would heighten Portland's reputation for having beautiful roses. This garden, completed in 1917, is the oldest continually operated and official public rose test garden in the US and contains various roses from around the world. During World War I, Europeans sent many new hybrids to this testing site in order to prevent them from being destroyed by the current bombings. It is a non-profit attraction that is free to viewers, and is maintained by over 500 hours yearly of volunteer service. There are numerous different gardens with different themes contained within the test site. The Gold Medal Garden contains every selection from the yearly Gold Medal award. The International Rose Test Garden contains exceptional roses from the All-American Rose Selection (AARS). These roses there are tested on 14 characteristics, including color, disease resistance, form, foliage, fragrance, and habitat. The Miniature Rose Garden is unique in that it only tests miniature roses. There are only 5 similar testing grounds owned by the ARS. The Shakespeare garden is a popular spot that only contains trees, flowers, and herbs that were mentioned in Shakespearian plays and roses named after Shakespearian characters. The Queen's Walk honors Queens of Portland's Rose Festival, Oregon's premier civic celebration since 1907, with a bronze star for each crowned Queen. Tourists agree that this garden is a must-see for anyone visiting Portland, and some declare that it's worth a special trip to Portland just to see the many brilliant flowers. There are many picnic areas, and a amphitheater there hosts events such as concerts and plays.  Roses bloom from April to October and reach their peak in June, so visitors and owners recommend visiting the place in mid-summer."
"A Quirky Extravaganza of Art and Diversity - Alberta Arts District in Portland","Oregon","A Quirky Extravaganza of Art and Diversity - Alberta Arts District in Portland","This artsy, unique area prizes its individualism and displays its eclectic mix of art galleries, shops, and restaurants with great, swelling pride. The interesting mix of Alberta style is in part created by the multi-cultural diversity of the residents, the visitors, and the art. Some stores have been in the district for what seems like forever, while new ones contribute to the ever-changing flair. The Alberta District didn't earn its nickname, the Arts District,'' just because of its many galleries displaying local artworks. In fact, each and every restaurant and coffee shop gratuitously displays arts of all kinds, and each shop is so unique that it almost functions as its own art gallery. As if this wasn't enough to show off their incredible, vibrant style, the district is full of murals and statues that can be enjoyed by people just passing by. In fact, the Alberta Arts District feels like a functional museum, and it's impossible to pass by without noticing it and taking a long look. Retail stores sell all kinds of trendy and interesting items, such as paper mache lamps, handmade local designer clothing, and imported gifts from afar. Each subculture in Portland seems to be represented by at least one coffee house, since it seems there can never be enough coffee shops in the city, and events, such as artsy fairs and festivals, take place in the area year-round. For example, the district features an event called Last Thursday'' where on each Thursday of the month, galleries and shops are open late for viewers to enjoy. It's perhaps the most popular and well-known event in the district, and its made possible be Art on Alberta.'' Art on Alberta, a nonprofit coordination of art-related organizations, functions to provide education to a wide ranging audience to foster understanding and appreciation al all forms of art.'' This organization is in charge of the annual Art Hop, which displays varieties of art, juried exhibits, and all kinds of performances. During the Art Hop, an enormous diversity of stands and carts are available selling food, face painting, crafts, and art works. The AoA (Art on Alberta) proudly states that their intent is (to increase) the visibility of the art events in this community to foster the voice that we lend to the larger dialogue. Hosting a major art event such as Art Hop challenges our members, animates and inspires artists, unifies the business community, and builds Alberta Street's reputation as an exciting place for art in the Portland metropolitan area.'' AoA also provides an Art Map for the Last Thursday Art Walk. It organizes the Art Agog project, which creates scrap metal structures made by teens in the Vocational Village to display on the street, and the Tannenbaum Maddness where unusual holiday trees are displayed. They even publish a monthly electronic newsletter. They oversee the Community Mural Project, inviting community members to increase the beauty of the district through painting, and they also focus on revitalizing buildings all over the district, commercial as well as residential. Without AoA, Alberta would not be the magnificent collection of art and culture that it is today."
"A World of Trees for the Future","Oregon","A World of Trees for the Future - and the Present - Hoyt Arboretum","The Hoyt Arboretum is a non-profit museum of living trees from across the globe spanning 187 acres of land. There are more than 1,000 species of trees and plants represented there, all of which have been grown from seeds that were collected in the wild. Tourists and locals alike can enjoy the magnificence of the titanic collection by strolling down the miles of trails, soaking in the peace and calm that the beauty of nature brings. The Hoyt Arboretum views itself as a promise to future generations.'' Most trees take decades to grow to be mature, and the creators of the arboretum state that Just as we are enjoying mature, wonderful trees that were planted many years ago, the trees we plant today will grow to provide shade, beauty and value for decades and centuries to come.'' To remind visitors of the gain future generations will have from this large garden, the arboretum commonly displays the Greek Proverb: A society grows great when men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.'' The Hoyt Park,'' as it was originally called, was deeded to the city in 1922. The property that is now known as the Hoyt Arboretum was going to be used for residential development, but civic leaders had a vision of placing a public park in that space devoted to conserving a wide variety of trees from around the world. The idea quickly caught interest and the first steps were taken to create the beautiful park that we see today. The arboretum isn't just a calm oasis from urban life, with 21 trails covering 12 miles for visitors to unwind and enjoy. In fact, this living laboratory'' is an important resource to conserve plant biodiversity. The area is used by scientist and students for plant research, as well as the preservation of hundreds of magnificent tree species. It's an especially important place because, since the collections feature trees from all around the world, scientists and students are given the opportunity to study plants and trees that don't grow in the Northwest. The Hoyt Arboretum has another function that is a huge benefit to our planet: because the area maintains the growth of so many species from such a wide area, the seeds the plants produce are useful to restore destroyed or at risk native ecosystems. Visitors are given several resources to make their visit more enjoyable: in the Visitor's Center, people can find free trail maps, self-guided walk brochures, and educational material as well as volunteers that answer questions and provide information about the collections. Parking, restrooms, and ADA accessible trails are provided. Each tree is identified with nearby labels to help curious viewers to learn more about any of the trees they are interested in. Each collection of the trees is organized by geography and plant families (technically referred to as taxonomy''). The world of trees for all seasons'' is only 2 miles west of the bustling metropolitan downtown area of Portland. It's easy to access by bus, car, or Max light rail."

"All You Could Ever Buy and as Much Fun As You Could Ever Have at Lloyd Center Mall - Lloyd Center mall","Oregon","All You Could Ever Buy and as Much Fun As You Could Ever Have at Lloyd Center Mall - Lloyd Center mall","Anyone living in or visiting Portland can find a plethora of shopping opportunities at Lloyd Center mall. With over 200 stores to choose from, using three levels and 1,472,000 square feet of space, anyone can find just about anything they need in this large shopping center. The mall offers complimentary wheelchairs, a lost and found, strollers, gift cards, and a customer service center to make buyers' experience in the mall more pleasurable. Also, with Lloyd Center just a few minutes drive from downtown, the mall is only a short distance from other restaurants, shops, and attractions. There's more to do in the mall than just shop and eat: within the mall is a Regal Cinemas theater that has 18 screens, and there's another bigger theater owned by Lloyd Center right across the street. On the floor level is the Lloyd Center Ice Rink where hundreds of children, adults, and families come to have fun every day. The ice rink offers classes, birthday parties, freestyle, dance, summer camps, group parties, skate rentals, broomball, and private ice. Shoppers that want to get away from the bustle to relax need only cross the street to get to the park, a lovely place full of trees and shade to sit on a bench and relax. Next to the park is a Max light rail platform, making it easy to get to and from Lloyd Center quickly. The mall was opened in 1960. Owners wanted to build it decades sooner, but because of events such as World War II and the Great Depression, it was put off for 37 years. When the mall was first built, it had about 100 stores, making it the largest shopping center in the Pacific Northwest. Today, the mall remains the biggest in Oregon. It is currently owned by Glimcher Realty Trust. Back when it was first built, the mall had an open ceiling, but in 1991 it was renovated and the owners closed the ceiling. During that renovation, the owners also added a food court that houses 17 restaurants. The restaurants of the food court provide all kinds of different delicious foods, from fancy Asian food, sea food, fast-food chains, and coffee and pastry shops. The Lloyd Center mall gets its name from the Lloyd District it is centered in, a commercial neighborhood named after Ralph Lloyd, who started the development in the area. Most of the district is east of I-5. It includes many principal landmarks (Lloyd Center being one of the primary landmarks), as well as restaurants, hotels, shops, apartments, condominiums, and office buildings. The mall has specialized products, such as the Disney Store, Made in Oregon, Bath & Body Works, Motherhood Maternity and much more. A reviewer of this mall wrote, Great Vibes at This Mall! For some odd reason, the first time I went to Portland's Lloyd Center Mall, I fell in love with it instantly! I feel so good there - it has a great atmosphere.'' Locals visit Lloyd center regularly; it's a common place for activities, get-togethers, and - of course - shopping for just about anything."
"An Architectural Masterpiece Sits at the Top of Portland - Pittock Mansion","Oregon","An Architectural Masterpiece Sits at the Top of Portland - Pittock Mansion","This home, built by Portland pioneers and completed in 1914, is a richly decorated, eclectic architectural wonder. It stands as a testament of two hard working people that started out barefoot and penniless. The mansion represents Portland's early history and documents the transformation of Portland from a forest clearing and a small lumbar town to a business center and bustling city. Visitors can learn about what life was like in the early 20th century, as well as picnic in the breathtaking gardens and capture photos of the scenic backdrops. Henry Lewis Pittock was born in England and traveled to Oregon in 1853. Georgiana Martin Burton, native to Missouri, met him after making the voyage to Portland and became his wife in 1860. Henry Pittock was a brilliant businessman and built real estate, steamboats, railroads, silver mining, banks, sheep ranches, and the pulp and paper industry. He became the owner of the Weekly Oregonian, which is still in circulation and being read by Oregonians today. His wife was passionately involved in community service and assisted in founding the Ladies Relief Society to care for needy children, and she worked for the Woman's Union and helped build a the Martha Washington Home for working, single women. The couple lived together for 58 years and had six children, though they only lived in the mansion for 5 years. Planning for the mansion began in 1909. Henry and Georgiana had it built in the West hills 1,000 feet above the city's skyline so that it would overlook their beloved Portland. The home is a stunning example of early 20th century architecture, with Turkish, French, and English designs and ingenious features, such as a central vacuum system, indirect lighting, and intercoms. The estate was put on the market by one of the Pittock's grandsons in 1958. Citizens became worried about the rising threats of storm damage and demolition by land developers, so they raised funds and persuaded the City of Portland to purchase and restore the community landmark. The City bought the home for $225,000 and spent fifteen months restoring it. Finally, in 1965, the mansion was opened for the public to discover the beauty and intricacy of the structure and to learn about the remarkable family that once lived there. Not only is the house itself of immense historical interest, but the mansion is full of old furnishings, art works, and artifacts. Some of these pieces were bought by Portland citizens who wanted the home to become as true to its original appearance as possible before it became open to the public. They were purchased from Pittock family members that had inherited the original furniture. These magnificent pieces include the Stinway grand piano and Henry Pittock's ceremonial sword. The rest were collected from generous donors and interior design shows. In fact, 90 percent of the artifacts in the Pittock mansion collection were donated. After much work, funding, and donating, the Pittock mansion is a complete display of the splendor the house might have had, waiting for curious tourists and loyal locals to admire and enjoy."

The museum owns the U.S. Navy's last non-nuclear, fast-attack submarine, the USS Blueback (SS-581), which is open for visitors to crawl inside and tour. This submarine is special because it was the first battle-ready one to use the teardrop hull, and because it appeared in the hit movie The Hunt for Red October. Many labs are available for children and adults to get their hands dirty playing with real science demonstrations. There's the vernier technology lab where visitors can learn about computers and robotics, the physics lab where visitors can play with electricity, the paleo lab where visitors can excavate models of fossils cast from real Oregon fossils, the life science lab where visitors can see spiders, insects, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, the chemistry lab, the discovery lab, the watershed lab, and the laser and holography lab.

If that's not enough to entertain the average visitor, OMSI also has occasional events to make the experience even more memorable. But OMSI is more than just an ingenious museum. It also provides many educational programs (one of which is the largest outreach education program in the US), some of which travel to students in five different states. There are also summer camps, development workshops for teachers, works in partnership with schools throughout Oregon, and more. The influence OMSI has on the local community is incredible; the influence it has on visitors, unforgettable."
"An Unusual Garden of Art Made of Rocks - Petersen Rock Garden, Redmond","Oregon","An Unusual Garden of Art Made of Rocks - Petersen Rock Garden, Redmond","This is the most quirky yet fascinating art display anyone could ever see in the Northwest. The garden contains four acres of all kinds of structures built merely from local rocks mortared together. There are castles, replicas of historic buildings, miniature bridges, terraces, towers, lagoons, monuments, light houses, fountains, and more. Visitors that aren't interested in the folk-art can stop by to stretch their legs and enjoy the tranquility of the area, which is beautifully landscaped with lily ponds and picnic tables, lush gardens and small streams. Wildlife such as ducks, chicken, cats, and peacocks roam free around the property. The structures and statues were created by Denmark immigrant Rasmus Peterson. In 1906, Peterson had settled in Redmond where he began his life as a farmer. The Cascade Mountains have seen a lot of volcanic activity, making this area a lush museum of rare and beautiful stones. Peterson started collecting rocks within an 85-mile radius of his home as a hobby. Some of his common finds include Oregon agates, petrified wood, obsidian, malachite, thunder egg, and jasper. Over the years, Peterson's rock collection grew enormous. He finally used his collection to build monuments, bridges and miniature buildings in 1935. It instantly started attracting attention until in 1950, the place opened as the Peterson Rock Garden, spanning four acres around Peterson's farmhouse. Now, sixty years later, people from all around the world stop by to visit this eccentric display of large art. Most of the art is very folksy. Peterson definitely honored his Danish roots, but he also paid respect to his newly found home with American styles. One of the most popular structures, a replica of the Statue of Liberty, has a plaque at the bottom that reads, Enjoy Yourself - It Is Later Than You Think.'' Near the parking lot is the Peterson Museum, a cute space with items for sale and all kinds of rock and mineral specimens on display. The family keeps the museum and garden running for a small fee by donation. Peterson's step daughter, Mrs. Hegardt, recalls that No sooner had he started (building) than people were telling him about the different kinds of rock they'd seen, and he'd go and haul it back and use it to make something.'' Reviews concur they haven't seen anything like it. Whether they leave breathless and marveling over the intricacy of the art, or they leave shaking their heads and wondering how anyone could have so much spare time, they pretty much all agree that they enjoyed the break. Visitors can spend as little has half and hour and as many as four hours in the garden, depending on their interest. As time goes by, the garden continues to catch the attention of those that love anything unusual. It has been featured in books such as Weird US,'' Strange Sites,'' and Eccentric America.'' Yet, although there is nothing else remotely like it, there's something almost comfortable about the structures. It's a trip worth taking that adults and children alike are sure to enjoy."

To add to the authentic beauty and serenity of the garden, music is played every Sunday and Thursday by the Portland Orchids and Bomboo Chinese Ensemble. Mosaic pathways wind through the landscape, leading visitors through the peaceful array of blossoms and plant life. As new plants blossom and new ones are added, owners boast that the Portland Classical Chinese Garden is never the same.'' The idea for the garden began in 1988 when Portland became a sister city with Suzhou, China, one of the oldest cities in China. Suzhou has a mild climate that is similar to Portland's, making it easy to imitate Suzhou plant life in the Western Town. Imperial court officials had planted magnificent gardens in housing complexes to imitate Chinese landscape paintings. The builders of the attraction decided to base it on a garden that was built in Suzhou during the Ming Dynasty, which existed between 1368 and 1644 A.D. It takes up one city block in China town and is approximately 40,000 square feet. The garden didn't open until September 14, 2000, and it cost approximately $12.8 million to complete. All of the plants are indigenous to China, though many of them are US grown, and some of them are over 100 years old. Some of the plants have been added to introduce wild Asian flora to the Western world for the first time. Other plants have been in traditional Chinese gardens for many centuries, while others are scientific experiments attempting to breed certain traits. Regardless of their purpose and individual history, each plant and flower blends into a magnificent display of Chinese excellence. Almost all of the materials came directly from China. Over 500 tons of limestone that was mined from a Lake in Suzhou, Lake Tai, was shipped to Portland to be added to the garden. These rocks - called Tai Hu - are significant because of their rough texture, slenderness, top heaviness, and holes that are inside them. The Chinese believe that life force can flow freely through these holes, making them a useful addition to a garden. Because tea is a vital part of Chinese culture, no Classical Chinese Garden would be complete without a tea house. Tea was used originally as medicine, but it has grown to become a tradition and an important symbolic aspect of everyday life. The Tao of Tea is in the Tower of Cosmic Reflections in the garden. Visitors can taste tea authentic from China and sample a small snack."
"Bagby Hot Springs","Oregon","Bagby Hot Springs - Estacada, Oregon - Hiking, Camping, Hot Springs","Bagby Hot Springs are developed natural hot springs located in the Mount Hood National Forest. Wooden flumes channel spring water into several bathhouses and private tubs. Naturally heated at the spring source to one hundred and thirty-six degrees Fahrenheit, there are wooden buckets to fill from cold spring water spigots, and then mix the cold water in the hot tubs until you reach your desired temperature. The trailhead to Bagby Hot Springs is approximately fortymiles from Estacada, Oregon. From Estacada take Highway 224 for 26miles to Ripplebrook Guard Station. Then follow Forest Service Road 46 for 4miles to the junction with Forest Service Road 63. Turn right and follow Road 63 for 4additional miles to Forest Service Road 70. Turn right onto Road 70 and follow it for 6miles to the Bagby Trailhead. A Forest Service permit is required to park at the trailhead. Access roads to the trailhead can be closed after winter snowstorms. From the trailhead the hike to Bagby Hot Springs is about a mile and a half. You leave from a Forest Service parking lot and the trail is well marked. There are no services at Bagby Hot Springs. At the big round tubs there are cold water spigots. The water comes from a spring in the woods and people are known to drink this water. There are two outhouses at the trailhead. The Private Deck or main bathhouse has five rooms, each with its own hollowed log tub. A half roof over the chambers allows you to soak in the weather, or enjoy the night sky, without getting your clothes wet. Sometimes there is a line of people waiting for a private room. The Public Deck also goes by the names Open Deck, or Lower Deck. This platform has three, hollow-log tubs that were salvaged from the original bathhouse fire in 1979. Traditionally the Public Deck is used for communal bathing, please respect this and invite others to join you. One hundred yards south of the main bathhouse is the Upper Deck. This is not a private deck, it is meant to be communal, so please invite others to join your group. Here are a few tips to allow you to really enjoy Bagby Hot Springs and use them respectfully: -The hot springs are clothing optional. -Weather permitting they never close. -There is no charge for the hot springs. However, a day use permit for the parking lot is required. -Limit your soak to two hours if people are waiting for the private tubs. -There is the same time limit if you can't add more to the communal tubs and people are waiting. -Don't use soap or shampoo. -Clean the tub after each use with the provided brushes. -Bring a camera. -Visit the springs at odd hours or times of the year and in poor weather. That way they won't be so crowded. During the winter, the trail can be icy and very difficult. In any weather you need to wear a pair of good trail shoes or boots, dress for the weather, and bring a flashlight. Often bathers get up to the springs and stay much longer than they planned. So take a flashlight, even if you think you'll be back before dark."
"Bandon Dunes Golf Course","Oregon","Bandon Dunes Golf Course, Bandon, Oregon - A True Links-Style ``Thinker's Course'' Ranked As One of the Best in the Country","Bandon Dunes is one of three golf courses at the Bandon Dunes Resort in Bandon, Oregon. A fourth course is slated to open in 2010. The resort is set on Oregon's rugged coastline about 100 feet above the Pacific Ocean, making it an ideal location to capture the essence of Scotland's great links courses. Here, golfers will experience untamed shores that go on for miles, and grassy, primeval dunes that run out to the ocean. In describing the land used for the resort's courses, GOLF Magazine had this to say: Probably the finest land made available for a golf course in America since Alistair Mackenzie was shown the site for Cypress Point Club on Monterey Peninsula...'' Bandon Dunes was the first of the resort's courses to be built, opening in 1999. Designed by a Scotsman, David McLay Kidd, the course is situated on a bluff high above the Pacific Ocean and plays along the native dunes to reveal ocean views on nearly every hole. Said to be a thinker's course,'' Bandon Dunes is routed through completely natural, indigenous vegetation, with winds always present and adding to the challenge. In describing the routing, course architect McLay Kidd had this to say: I imagined the routing having the structure of a symphony - a strong start, a sense of anticipation, small crescendos, and an incredible finishing sequence along the Pacific. The course had to provide not only a challenge to every skill level, but also a sense of adventure and an exploration of this great landscape. As on true links courses, each hole offers several strategies to reach the green. Although the fairways and greens are large, the best line of attack requires accuracy, which can always be tricky. Players must consider the sea breeze and the firm sand-based turf. Newcomers to links golf must master playing the ball along the ground, shots that have all but disappeared from today's game.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,732 yards from the back (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.6 and a slope rating of 145 on Fescue grass. From the next set of Green tees, the course plays to only 6,221 yards, making it a relatively short course. The course begins on a massive dune, then winds through upland forests and open meadows before returning to finish in the dunes. Like all the courses at the resort, Bandon Dunes is for walkers only. Since its opening, Bandon Dunes has received much acclaim, including rankings among the top golf courses in the country. GOLF Magazine rated Bandon Dunes #6 among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play, Golfweek ranked it #5 on its list of Best Resort Courses and #6 on its list of Best Modern Courses, while Golf Digest ranked it #7 among America's Greatest Public Golf Courses. The resort features a Practice Center that covers 32 acres just east of the Pacific Dunes course, allowing players to work on all aspects of their game. Lessons and a golf shop are also available. A variety of lodging options are also available, as well as several full-service restaurants, lounges, hot tub, sauna, exercise room, and locker rooms."

In describing the course, architects Coore and Crenshaw had this to say: In the profession of golf architecture, all one can ask for is to be given an extraordinary site and the freedom to work with it. Mike Keiser has afforded both at Bandon Trails. We have tried to tread softly on this spectacular landscape, laying out a golf course that required little alteration to the site while providing golf as diverse as the land itself. As its name implies, Bandon Trails will take you on a journey, a nature walk if you will, through windswept dunes, meadows of vegetation framed by indigenous shrubbery, and through woodlands of towering fir and spruce trees. Sometimes the journey and the golf will be wild and tumultuous, sometimes serene. Whichever, we hope it will always be interesting and enjoyable.'' Since its opening, Pacific Dunes has received many honors and awards, including rankings among the top golf courses in the country.

This area, which is spread out over 300 yards from the base of the rock, is filled with tide pools and offers many opportunities to see various kinds of sea life. It is common to see anemones, crabs, sea stars, and more. Haystack Rock itself offers an excellent opportunity to do some bird watching due to the presence of a wide variety of seabirds.

"Columbia River Gorge","Oregon","Columbia River Gorge - Hood River, OR - a natural wonder formed by the Columbia River","Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area is home of the Columbia River Gorge in Hood River, Oregon. The river cuts through the canyon at sea level making it the only one in the Cascade Mountain Range. The canyon's southern walls are in Oregon and the northern walls are in Washington making the canyon eighty miles long; it reaches depths of four thousand feet. A number of basalt flows formed what is known as the Columbia River Plateau by covering thousands of acres. Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area was created when President Reagan signed a law for the 292,500 acres. While concerns for the management of the gorge were not solved new possibilities did emerge. The act did not turn the area into a park or wilderness but determined that the existing scenic and rural characteristics would be maintained. The goal of the act was to keep the areas as pure as possible while aiding in the economy of the surrounded area. The scenic area offers visitors the opportunity to go boating, hiking, camping or fishing. In addition visitors to the Columbia River Gorge can also harvest mushrooms, or gather firewood if they wish. While a number of services and facilities associated with participating in these activities there are some that require participants to obtain a permit or pay a fee. The fees and permit costs go toward managing, maintaining and improving the Columbia River Gorge.

Underground springs in Larch Mountain feed the Multnomah Falls, the flow is normally the highest during the spring and winter months. Visitors to the falls have the opportunity to study floods exposed by geology. There are five Yakima basalt flows that can be seen on the cliff surface of the falls. Columbia River Gorge has provided support to flourishing civilizations for over thirty-one thousand years. The Marmes and Folsom people that traveled from Asia across the Great Continental Divide left evidence of living in the area that has been found through archaeological digs. Evidence that people occupied the site of Five Mile Rapids which is a salmon fishing area for over ten thousand years was found during excavations of the area. The Columbia River Gorge itself and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area provide visitors with numerous opportunities to enjoy the natural beauty."
"Columbia River Gorge","Oregon","Columbia River Gorge, Hood River, OR","The Columbia River Gorge in Hood River, Oregon is one of the most spectacular natural sites North America has to offer. The Columbia River Gorge runs farther than the Hood River area as it is actually eighty miles long. The gorge is 4,000 feet deep in the north canyon, which is actually in Washington State. The south canyon walls are no less impressive in Oregon State. Columbia River Gorge is the only section of river canyon that is at sea level. The gorge is part of the Cascade Mountain Range. Recreation activities include hiking, mountain biking, windsurfing, camping, fishing, wildlife watching, birdwatching, boating, photography, rock climbing, and picnicking. All of this can be done at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. Visitors to the Columbia River Gorge area can spend time hiking a variety of different trails. Along these trails are numerous waterfalls. Over time the water in the gorge has created areas where the water must go over higher peaks in the Cascades, allowing for breathtaking views to be created. Multnomah Falls is the second highest water fall in the United States. It is also the second largest to remain year round rather than stop during winter when water is frozen. The falls are quite popular at all times of the year. The Columbia River Gorge has taken 31,000 years to form. A number of civilizations have taken up residents near the gorge for the water source it provides. This includes the Folsom and Marmes people who came over the Great Continental Divide from Asia. Geologists and archeologists have found evidence of these individuals during excavations. Other excavations near Five Mile Rapids, which is east of The Dalles have shown human remains. It was discovered as a great place for salmon fishing about 10,000 years ago. Geologically the Columbia River Plateau was formed due to basalt flows. These flows covered 164,000 square kilometers over time running through northeast Oregon, southwest Washington and the west of Idaho. The gorge as part of the national park can have some closures throughout the year based on danger. Fire closures, restrictions, and certain road conditions can account for the closures. A new trail bridge is open at Triple Falls. This trail takes visitors through a small area of the gorge with many trees and water to welcome visitors. Oneonta trail is going to be closed for a time in 2009 between Horsetail Falls and the new bridge. The river that runs through the gorge is actually 1,200 miles long with water from the Snake River emptying into the gorge.

Most of the holes also feature subtle-to-sharp doglegs through tree-lined layouts, often bending right near the ideal landing zones, but wayward shots will encounter thick rough, dirt, rocks and wild desert scrub brush farther from the short grass. There are only a handful of fairway bunkers, but the greens tend to be elevated, more heavily guarded by sand traps, which are often steep and deep, and surrounded by tight chipping areas. The greens are relatively flat, with only subtle to average controus, and tend to roll true. When they firm up later in the season, however, they can become rather slippery'' in both their breaks and speed. Water is fairly minimal on the course and only comes into play on a handful of holes, such as on hole No. 18, which doglegs through two large ponds. The layout also features old-growth trees, which will on occasion intrude into a fairway, as well as volcanic rock outcroppings and other elements of the natural environment. Since opening, the Sunriver Woodlands course has served to put the locale on the golfing map, while garnering numerous awards.  Golf Digest named Sunriver Woodlands a Top 25 Resort Course, a Top 5 Course in Oregon, and gave it a 4-Star Rating. Practice facilities at Sunriver include a driving range and putting and chipping greens. The clubhouse is designed as a classic, Northwest Lodge, which houses a golf shop, snack bar, lockers, and The Grille restaurant. Other amenities at the resort include a swimming pool, exercise facility, two tennis courts, and 3.25 miles of hiking and biking trails."
"Crosswater Club at Sunriver Resort, Crosswater Course, Sunriver, Oregon An Upscale, Heathland-Style Golf Course","Oregon","Crosswater Club at Sunriver Resort, Crosswater Course, Sunriver, Oregon An Upscale, Heathland-Style Golf Course","The Crosswater course is part of the 63-hole golf complex at the Crosswater Club at Sunriver Resort. The club is set amid 600 acres of scenic woodlands and wetlands, and the Crosswater course plays through a picturesque meadow. Water and wetlands come into play on as many as sixteen holes, depending on tee selection, as the Little Deschutes River threads through the course, while the Big Deschutes River borders the course on its west side. The Crosswater course is a traditional heartland layout and plays at an elevation of 4,183 feet, while offering views of Mt. Bachelor, Broken Top and The Three Sisters. Due to the elevation and low humidity, the course tends to play shorter than its yardage. That's a plus, since the course plays to a whopping 7,638 yards from the longest tees, with a daunting USGA rating of 76.9 and a slope rating of 150 on Pennlinks Creeping Bent grass and Poa Annua tees, fairways and greens, and Kentucky Bluegrass rough. From the Blue tees, the course plays to a more manageable 6,811 yards. The course, which opened in 1995, is a Robert E. Cupp design that tends to play firm and fast. When it's tournament time at the course, which has hosted both PGA and NCAA events, the stimpmeter on the greens has been as high as 12. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 2, a par-5 that plays to 582 yards from the longest tees. Known as the Water `N Woods,'' the hole offers a generous landing area off the tee. The hole still plays as one of the most difficult, however, thanks to a water hazard that guards a large, inviting putting surface that calls for an accurate approach shot. Hole No. 17 is a challenging par-3 that plays to 243 yards from the back tees, and 218 from the Blue tees. Nicknamed The Homestead,'' the hole ranks as one of the longest par-3s known to golf. Wetlands protrude into the fairway and also surround the left side of the green, as well as sand in the front and back, making for an exacting tee shot. The green is huge, which adds to the challenge of hitting an accurate tee shot for any hope of birdie or par. Since opening, the Crosswater course has received many accolades. GOLF Magazine named it one of the Top 10 Most Adventurous Golf Courses in America and also ranked it among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play. Golf Digest named Crosswater one of Golf's 50 Greatest Destinations, while Golfweek ranked it #17 among America's Best Residential Golf Courses. Practice facilities at Crosswater include a driving range and putting and chipping greens. The clubhouse is designed as a classic, Northwest Lodge, which houses a golf shop, snack bar, lockers, and The Grille restaurant. Other amenities at the resort include a swimming pool, exercise facility, two tennis courts, and 3.25 miles of hiking and biking trails."
"Discover a Surprise within ``Oyster Shells'' at the Pearl District Pearl District, Portland","Oregon","Discover a Surprise within ``Oyster Shells'' at the Pearl District Pearl District, Portland","This was once an area of warehousing and industrial yards called Northwest Industrial Triangle,'' but the Pearl District has blossomed into an upscale neighborhood of residences, businesses, and notable art galleries. Now it is recognized internationally and is an award-winning leader in urban renewal. It is located close to downtown Portland and right next to the Willamette river, making it a lovely area in close proximity to many important Portland locations. It is home to Portland icons such as Powell's Books, the former Weinhard Brewery, and is houses two public and highly innovative plazas. Part of the warehouse area was demolished in the 1990's, which allowed development opportunities for dozens of city blocks. Development boomed, encouraging pubs, restaurants, shops, and art galleries to scramble for a place in the new, ritzy area. It now stands as a testament of how new life can sprout for urban decay. Visible changes were actually few. According to urban legend, the name Pearl District'' was coined by a local gallery owner named Thomas Augustine, who said the warehouse buildings in the district were like oysters, crusty and drab, while the galleries, shops, and boutiques were like the pearls within the shells. However, the name could have come from an oyster canning factory that was in the area, and some say the name came from the fact that Chinese seafarers once hid pearls under the cobble stones in Twelfth Street. Regardless of the origin, the name quickly stuck. Today, the Pearl District is an enticing attraction for Portlanders and tourists alike. The restored buildings offer a historic perspective. The dining establishments there are considered to be some of the best in the city. There's a wide assortment of music, theater, and art activities to make the area culturally rich. The stores offer trendy and chic fashion, unique items, and more. Salons, spas, and beauty and health services are offered all around the district. To make the place even more pleasant, soothing urban parks are provided for visitors and inhabitants. Even free wireless internet is available throughout the area. Many have referred to the Pearl District as the gold standard'' for a mix-use space of living, working, and playing opportunities. Residents rarely own cars, since every needed service is close enough to walk, ride a bike, or take a bus to. The district has a tight community of friendly residents, many of which left single family homes in order to take part in the unity of the inhabitants. Part of what makes the people so harmonious with each other is the well-known fact that they all share an appreciation for the artistic, trendy, rich culture of the upscale Pearl District. And to think that such a chic city within a city grew from the crumbling remains of an industrial district."

"Eagle Point Golf club, Eagle Point, Oregon ? A Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Golf Course Set in Oregon's Rogue Valley","Oregon","Eagle Point Golf club, Eagle Point, Oregon ? A Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Golf Course Set in Oregon's Rogue Valley","Eagle Point Golf Club is a semi-private facility that's open to the public. Located in Oregon's Rogue Valley, the course is a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. design, which makes use of the natural terrain to create a pastoral setting as well as panoramic views of the volcanic Southern Cascade Mountain Range. The Rogue Valley features a gently rolling landscape with black, sticky clay as the prevalent soil. As a result, Jones used six inches of sand veneering to enhance drainage, and the course is considered one of the best drainage systems in Southern Oregon, making for ideal playing conditions year-round. The course, which opened in 1996, also features plenty of sand in its directional and strategic bunkering, with many traps located well forward of landing zones and well short of the sizable greens. This approach can lead to many optical illusions on the course and add to the challenge of proper club selection. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,096 yards from the longest (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 135 on Bermuda grass fairways and Bent grass greens. From the next (Gold) set of tees, the course plays to 6,576 yards. The layout for the course has the front nine holes weaving clockwise around a broad plain, while the back nine holes wind through a more challenging, elevated landscape. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 5, a short par-4 that plays to only 308 yards from the Gold Tees. The challenge on this hole is a fairway that pinches in around the landing zone, with two large sands traps encroaching from either side. Approach shots must then find an undulating green that's guarded by four more traps and also features a false front that falls off steeply. One of the most dramatic holes is No. 16, a long par-5 that plays to 591 yards from the back tees. When players tee off, they'll be looking at a backdrop that includes the snow-capped peaks of Mount McLoughlin and hitting to a rolling fairway that slopes downhill to meet a lake that guards the right side of the green. Eagle Point has received a number of accolades since opening, including being ranked #8 among Public Golf Courses in Oregon in the Golf Digest list of Best Places to Play for 2009. The course has also hosted many tournaments, including the Oregon Amateur Championship. The practice facilities at Eagle Point are also considered some of the finest in the Rogue Valley, with a grass driving range that simulates fairway conditions, chipping areas, a practice sand bunker, and 15,000-square-foot putting green. Eagle Point also features a clubhouse with a Golf Shop, a full-service lounge, and fine dining and full-service bar at Arthur's Restaurant."

"Forest Park","Oregon","Forest Park - Portland, Oregon - Plenty of Trails and Wildlife","Forest Park is a public park located in Portland, Oregon. The park is in the Tualatin Mountains and was acquired in 1947. It consists of over 5,150 acres and has hillsides that overlook the Willamette River. Park hours are from 5:00am to 10:00pm daily. There are hiking trails, biking trails, equestrian trails, and guided trails. There are roughly seventy miles of trails available. The 30-mile Wildwood Trail segment of the 40 Mile Loop System crosses back and forth through the park. The 40 Mile Loop is a misnomer, because the total path is now roughly 140 miles. The Wildwood Trail is recognized as a National Recreation Trail. The trail begins at Hoyt Arboretum and ends at Newberry Road. The Stone House is one of the landmarks on the Wildwood Trail. The Stone House was originally a public restroom that was built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. Due to vandalism, the building was gutted because the repairs would have been quite costly. The Stone House still exists as a landmark and a place to rest along the trail. There are over 62 different mammalian species and 112 unique species of birds in the park. The park has a huge canopy of trees and a wealth of undergrowth. This makes the park a good natural air purifier and erosion controller. Forest Park is also home to over 100 native species of shrubs and trees. The three main species of trees in the park are the western red cedar, the western hemlock, and the Douglas fir. Other types of trees are present in smaller numbers, such as the black cottonwood, the madrone, the western yew, the grand fir, the red alder, and the big leaf maple. There is a variety of vegetation, including bracken, fireweed, and thistle grasses. Salmonberry, thimbleberry, and blackberry shrubs are located throughout the park. Some of the different forms of wildlife found in the park include: bobcats, black-tailed deer, little brown bats, blue grouse, northern flying squirrels, gophers, elk, great horned owls, ospreys, orange-crowned warblers, pacific jumping mice, and creeping voles. Park wildlife is threatened by overuse of the park, invasive plants, encroachment, and a lack of maintenance. Pollution and urban development have reduced the number of wildcats, bears, and wolves. At the same time, the number of small predators like raccoons and weasels has increased. The English ivy present in the park is invasive and less supportive of some of the native insects. The population of these insects has declined, which has also led to a decline in the number of salamanders and other amphibians that feed on the insects. The Forest Park Conservancy was created to help support the park. The Conservancy helps with fundraising, resource management, and improved recreational experiences for visitors. The park receives about forty inches of rain each year. There are several small creeks that run through the park, most of which are unnamed. There are five names streams: Miller Creek, Doane Creek, Saltzman Creek, Rocking Chair Creek, and Balch Creek. These streams eventually flow into the Willamette River."

"Haystack Rock","Oregon","Haystack Rock - Cannon Beach, OR - Scenic Beach","One of the most photographed places on the west coast has to be that of the Haystack Rock, Cannon Beach, OR. This beautiful rock, which is 235 feet tall, stands majestically out of the water. It is the third largest monolith in the world. Haystack Rock is a world of biodiversity and a protected place. On the rock itself, there are many seabirds that lay their nests there each year. Birdwatchers will be able to see tufted puffins, cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots, and gulls. The Rock is declared to be a sanctuary and no boats, planes or even helicopters are allowed near it, because this may cause mothers to abandon their babies. People are not allowed to climb the Rock, either. At the base of the Rock is another world of biodiversity - the tidepools. When the tide goes out, it leaves a large area for people to see the various kinds of life in the tidepools. Because the beach area is very shallow, this leaves an area about 300 yards surrounding the Rock. Visitors can carefully walk through the area, called the Marine Garden, and will find starfish, anemones, crabs, seastars, and more. When the tide goes out, there are official people nearby who can talk about the area and the various types of sea life that is found in the tidal pools. They are there to answer questions and to help protect the area, too. Many people come to Haystack Rock to be able to take pictures. It certainly is one of the most photographed objects in Oregon. The Rock is beautiful from many angles and times of day. The beach offers a number of activities, too. It is nine miles long, and it is next to the town of Cannon Beach. The town is small, with only about 1,600 people, but it is ready for tourists. About 750,000 people visit the area each year.

Bricks for the lighthouse came from San Francisco. -The builders finished the compound in August 1893, at a cost of $80,000 -The assistant lightkeepers' house is now a bed and breakfast with facilities for group events. -The head lightkeeper's house was sold for $10 in 1940 to a buyer who tore it down and used it for lumber.

The mariners that sailed the waters between Newport and Coos Bay asked to have a lighthouse assist them in finding their way a center later and Heceta Head was the perfect spot. The order for a First Order Fresnel Lens was placed during 1892 with Chance Brothers in England.

"History of the Columbia River Preserved at the Oregon Maritime Museum Oregon Maritime Center & Museum","Oregon","History of the Columbia River Preserved at the Oregon Maritime Museum Oregon Maritime Center & Museum","Portland has always been an important river port , making river marine and recreation a vital aspect of life in the state and nearby communities. The Oregon Maritime Museum seeks to teach locals and visitors about the history of the Columbia river basin and preserve maritime objects and records for scholars and the public. It features many models of different kinds of ships that travelled the Willamette and Columbia rivers, including military ships such as the Battleship Oregon, as well as paintings, navigational instruments, and other relevant artifacts. The history this museum covers spans a 150-year period of rich and interesting maritime activity. The museum includes several exhibits, all on boats and ships. Str. Portland is a stern-wheel tug boat that was built in 1947 to help ocean going ships into the Portland Harbor. In 1981, she was retired, and the Maritime Museum was able to add her to their collection. Her hull, which is where the fuel, 8 watertight bulkheads, and the feedwater and potable water tanks are located, is made of welded steel plates over steel frames. The Gil Netter is set on the Moms Boat, which was built in Astoria, Oregon for fishing in 1929. This type of boat was known for being very fast for the period. This boat was originally made out of materials that are impossible to find today, including oak ribs and Port Orford Cedar planking. The materials used explain how the boat was able to survive, despite the rigors of fishing. A visitor said the highlight of the museum is the engine room, where visitors can see steam engines, the boiler, and control systems and learn more about how these historical boats functioned. The museum includes tours, lectures, educational programs, and a research library. Lectures inform visitors about the ship's construction and function, life as a sea-farer, and how nautical instruments worked. There's even a gift show that sells different maritime items, nautical books, and shirts and hats. All in all, it's a wonderful example of history and the technical skill of a past era. The Oregon Maritime Center and Museum is located in Tom MCall Waterfront Park, a beautiful grassy area where many Portland fairs and events take place, in front of the Battleship Oregon Memorial."
"Hometown of Multnomah Falls (Oregon) on Historic National Scenic Highway Beckons to Tourists and Investors","Oregon","Hometown of Multnomah Falls (Oregon) on Historic National Scenic Highway Beckons to Tourists and Investors","Only a 30 minute drive from Portland one finds the Multnomah Falls in Troutdale Oregon. Unlike many of the waterfalls in the north western United States, these falls are permanent, flowing throughout the year, making it the second in the country, only after Yosemite Falls. There are 77 waterfalls in all on the Oregon side of the Colombia River. At the misty base of the falls the Multnomah Falls Lodge, offers lunch and a beautiful view from your table in this quaint structure that was erected in 1925. The trail to the top of the walls begins at the lodge and goes past the concrete bridge where the Gorge National Scenic Highway crosses the lower part of the falls and goes all the way to the top of the 620-foot falls (a little more than a 1-mile trail hike), The hike can be extended from the top of the falls by taking another trail to the top of Larch Mountain. (Real adventure hikers climb down into the nearby Oneonta Gorge to hike the river that winds beneath a series of falls.) The Gorge National Scenic Highway, where the Multnomah Falls (Oregon) is located is a beautiful 70-mile drive which relaxed travelers may want to spend a week to enjoy. Eleven waterfalls in all can be found along this one stretch. This is the first scenic highway to become a National Historic landmark. Built in 1913 and considered quite the feat of engineering at the time, it was deliberately designed to take advantage of the local natural beauty. When one goes into town at Troutdale, one is immediately charmed by the historic downtown's 19th century architecture housing antique shops and galleries. Fishing is abundant in Troutdale as the Sandy River, which the Multnomah pours into, is famous for its salmon. The various gorges in the area are home to abundant vegetation and flowers. At Lewis and Clark State Park in Troutdale there is boat access to both the Sandy River and Columbia River. White water rafting and windsurfing are both big pastimes in the area although the town promotes numerous activities, from kayaking to Karate lessons. Roughly 14,000 people live in Troutdale, which since 2007 was declared, together with Fairview, an Enterprise Zone by the State in an effort to attract industrial development and quality jobs to the area. Eligible businesses are being given full tax abatement for up to 3 years, thus making it a timely moment for environmentally friendly investors to consider relocating to Troutdale, home of the Multnomah Falls (Oregon)."

"Kidd's Toy Museum","Oregon","Kidd's Toy Museum - Portland, Oregon - One of the Finest Collections of Mechanical Banks","The Kidd's Toy Museum is located at 1300 SE Grand Avenue in Portland, Oregon. Mr. Frank Kidd is a lifetime toy collector, and Kidd's Toy Museum houses his collection. When he first began his collection, Frank Kidd was mainly interested in collecting vehicular toys. His interest was probably influenced by the fact that his family was in the automotive parts business. Even today, Kidd's Toy Museum is next door to his auto parts store. Kidd expanded his interest in toys and later began collecting trains, banks, railroad locks, early Oregon memorabilia, police badges, and lanterns. His wife, Joyce, expanded his collection by adding her own collection of teddy bears, holiday collectibles, and dolls. The museum itself is in a dull, gray building and can easily be missed. There is only a small white sign on the door that lets patrons know that the museum is there. The first toy acquired for the collection was a Buddy L pedal car. Since that time, Kidd has traveled to Europe and various places in the United States in order to acquire more toys for his collection. Kidd's collection today consists primarily of toys from the 1869 to 1939 period. The heart of the collection is Kidd's mechanical banks. Kidd's Toy Museum boasts one of the finest collections of mechanical banks in existence. The collection contains lead and brass patterns that were used for making mechanical banks, as well as some patent office models. Also included in the collection are a number of original sand-casting molds. One of the highlights of the bank collection is a pair of banks that show Jonah being swallowed by a whale and then being spit back out again. Another one of the banks shows Michael Dukakis and George H. W. Bush peering through the holes of an 88 logo, which is the year that they were both presidential candidates. While the collection is kept behind glass, there is much to see at Kidd's Toy Museum. The collection includes toy trucks, Disney paraphernalia, and gumball machines. Many of the more modern toys in the collection are plastic banks that were bequeathed to Kidd by a friend. One of these banks is called Dual at the Dome.'' This particular bank features a football player attempting to tackle someone else before they are able to score a touchdown. The museum also has a corner display of a cast iron toy stove. It is actually a fully-functional miniature version of a cast iron stove with four burners. Even though it is considered a toy, a person would actually be able to use it to cook if firewood were placed in it. Several of the toys in the museum are not what would be considered politically correct by today's standards, but they reflect a part of history. The museum is open Monday through Thursday from 12:00pm to 6:00pm and from 1:00pm to 6:00pm on Friday. Weekends and other hours are available by appointment. The museum can be reached by calling 503-233-7807. Currently, there is no charge for admission to the museum."

"Life-sized Dinosaur Statues on Display in the Prehistoric Gardens Prehistoric Gardens, Port Orford","Oregon","Life-sized Dinosaur Statues on Display in the Prehistoric Gardens Prehistoric Gardens, Port Orford","Dinosaur buffs can come to the Prehistoric Gardens to see over two dozen life-sized dinosaur statues set in a genuine Oregon rain forest. Children and adults alike can be awed by the gigantic and colorful Tyrannosaurus Rex, which could grow to be as much as 40 feet high, as well as a Pterodactyl, a Triceratops, and many more beautiful dinosaurs. The forest is nestled in a small valley that is mild in climate and typically drenched in rainfall, complete with steamy mist and colorful vegetation to match the look of a prehistoric jungle. It is completely over run with drippy moss and giant ferns wrapped in shadow, making it an adventure for any lover of wildlife. When sculptor E. V. Nelson had the idea to create these works of art, he had no idea that he would spend 40 years building them. Once his art works increased in quantity, the artist decided to make the works into a tourist attraction. Nelson boasted that his cement-over-wire statues are scientifically correct, in design as well as size. The gardens aren't just a pleasant walk in an authentic jungle with enormous works of art; the experience attempts to be educational as well. Visitors can learn a little history about the dinosaur (and learn how to pronounce the large animal's large name) by looking at plaques placed nearby the statues. Many visitors and reviewers have described this place as somewhat kitsch,'' saying it's something of tawdry design created to appeal to popular taste. However, many agree that it is still a nice place to stretch one's legs while traveling on the road, and most viewers that weren't impressed with the gardens agree that they're worth stopping at if you're tired of driving on highway 101. The Moon Coastal Oregon travel handbook says that when driving past the gardens, If you've got children in the car, unless they're sleeping or blindfolded, you're probably going to have to pull over'' (Morris, 172). And what child wouldn't want to imagine that giants who roamed the earth millions of years ago are still alive today?"
"Lithia Park","Oregon","Lithia Park, Ashland, Oregon","Ashland, Oregon is in the southwest section of the state. In fact it is almost in a direct line from Portland, and is one of the largest cities of the state. It borders California. Ashland is a popular college town with the Southern Oregon University. It is also home to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Ashland was settled by Shasta Indians until the 1800's in which European settlers began to move west following the Applegate Trail. There were violent clashes with settlers due to the gold found in Rich Gulch, a tributary of Jackson Creek in Ashland. From the gold found in the area, the city began to increase in size to be the commerce city it is today. In 1887 Portland, Ashland, and San Francisco were placed on the same rail line. This line ran until 1926 when it changed routes to go through Klamath Falls. Lithia Park is an attraction in Ashland. It has been registered with the National Historic Society. The park contains 93 acres of forested land sitting on canyon land around Ashland Creek. It stretches towards downtown, and ends at Mount Ashland. The name arose from the origins of Lithium Oxide or Lithia found in the stream water, which gets pumped into the park grounds. The park has two large green areas, a musical stage, two duck ponds, a playground, tennis courts, and an ice rink. There are also community buildings for shelter and picnics. Throughout the park are miles of hiking trails. The area known as Lithia Park was established by Abel Helmen and Eber Emery. The entrance to the park was once the entrance to the flour mill the two had. At this time it was called Ashland Mills. However, the building depreciated due to disuse, and many wanted the mill and livestock buildings which were abandoned to be removed. The Women's Civic Improvement Club worked on tearing down the buildings to establish a park. In 1907 the Lithia water spring was found at Emigrant Creek. A journalist even wrote about the natural springs which gained them popularity as a place to visit. In 1914 the Park Commission passed a bond to have the park landscaped and designed by John McLaren, well known at the time for Golden Gate Park. The park has always been a place for residents and visitors to enjoy outdoor activities. In 1974 the park was severely damaged by a flood which uprooted a lot of the landscape. It took several years to repair the park, as well as improve the drainage. Unfortunately the work was not enough for the 1997 flood in which the park and Ashland Plaza were damaged. Work around Lithia Creek and parks bridges in the following years helped to decrease the chance of floods. Now Lithia Park is even more of a centerpiece for Ashland. During the summer months live bands, concerts, and other events are held during the evenings for free entertainment. The day allows for children to play around on the playground while their parents set up a picnic."

It's a cross between a cabin and a tent. Yurts are round, canvas covered wood structures. They have a deadbolt on the door and come equipped with heater, beds, light and table. The floors are elevated off the ground on a wood platform so they stay dry, no matter the weather. Just roll out your sleeping bag or make the bed with blankets and you're ready to go. There isn't a kitchen, nor is there a bathroom, you are still camping. This campground has a meeting hall that accommodates fifty people. Great for all-weather gatherings like family reunions or club meetings. Reservations are recommended. Bird song, the sound of ocean waves, and the whisper of the wind are a few of the sounds of Nehalem Bay State Park, sunsets over the ocean just one of the views. There are so many things to do at this park, or you can sit and do nothing but meditate. Enjoy the often-reported serenity of this place. Online reviewers of the park list serenity frequently in their comments."
"Newberry National Volcanic Monument","Oregon","Newberry National Volcanic Monument - Bend, OR - an active volcano in Bend, Oregon","The Newberry National Volcanic Monument was created during November 1990 in the Deschutes National Forest boundaries. The U.S. Forest Service manages the monument which provides unique opportunities to see central Oregon's Lava Lands. The monument has fifty thousand acres of varying geologic features. Paulina Peak is the highest point in the Monument at 7,985 feet high and emphasizing the view of the High Desert and Oregon Cascades. There are two alpine lakes in the Newberry Volcano's summit area that are filled with salmon and trout. The volcano is five hundred square miles and active both geothermally and seismically. It is believed that the caldera is over a body of shallow magma that is only a maximum of five kilometers deep. The Lava Lands Visitor Center at the Newberry National Volcanic Monument is open Wednesday through Sunday from 9 A.M. until 5 P.M. during May through June and from September 8th through October 15th. The center is open seven days a week from 9 A.M. until 5 P.M. from the first of July until the 7th of September. The Newberry Volcano is composite volcano shaped like a shield with over a half million years of activity that includes caldera filling volcanism and caldera collapse. The volcano has erupted frequently with a number of eruptions in the Holocene. The volcano itself is approximately 3600 feet higher than the area around it. The Newberry Volcano covers over five hundred square miles and is one hundred and ten cubic miles in volume. The alluvium and lava flows of the volcano reach over forty miles from its base meaning that the volume of erupted material is probably more than the volume of the volcano. The Newberry Volcano's are made up of mainly air fall tuffs, ash flow, basaltic flows and alluvial deposits on the west and east sides. Lava flows and basaltic andesite cinder cones on the south and north sides. The fissure vents and cinder cones which are the source of a number of flows covering the volcano's surface are estimated at around four hundred. The upper and middle portions of the volcano also have a number of areas with flows, rhyolite domes, rhyodacite and dacite. The area of Newberry's summit caldera is estimated at being four miles north to south and five miles east to west. Paulina Creek cut a channel into the volcano to drain Paulina Lake making the caldera's west wall just a few tens of feet high in this area, other places in the wall of the caldera are only 500 to 1600 feet high. The Holocen and Pleistocene times found the caldera starting out 1600 feet deeper until domes, sedimentary rocks, flows and pyroclastic rocks filled it. The history of Newberry Volcano and the beauty of the surrounding area make the Newberry National Volcanic Monument in Bend, Oregon an interesting place to visit if you are ever in the area. Visitors to the volcano can see millions of years of the land formations history in the lava flows. Additional details can be gotten by contacting the visitor's center at Newberry Volcano National Volcanic Monument directly."

"Oakway Center","Oregon","Oakway Center - Eugene, OR - a shopping center that has been completely renovated","Oakway Center is a recently renovated shopping center with both national and local business within it. The Heritage Courtyard was added giving visitors a place to enjoy entertainment, dining and shopping under oak trees. The center can be reached using Interstate 5 from the west, north and south; those traveling from the east can take highway 126. Oakway Center was built during the 1960's and was the first enclosed mall in Eugene, Oregon's northern suburbs. Thirty years after the construction the amount of customers visiting the mall had begun to dwindle because of the tenants and outdated appearance of the building. A family owned business found in Eugene, McKay Investment Co. owns the center and claims a low rate of vacancy. There was a ninety-three percent rate of occupancy during January of 1995 when the renovations began. The idea behind the renovations was to create an upscale center and return it to the original standing. The Oakway Center is 150,000 square feet making it unable to compete with regional malls. The center is on a triangular piece of land that covers twenty-five acres. The cosmetic appeal of the center is not the only thing that was of concern with the renovations although the store fronts and roof were a concern of the inner and outer appearances. The large amount of traffic that goes through the area on a daily basis was taken into consideration as well to find the best methods for attracting patrons to the mall. The first phase of renovating Oakway Center was at a cost of approximately two million dollars. The interior, exterior and signage were redesigned as part of this renovation phase. The fazade was ripped off the front of the building and redesigned. A canopy of glass and steel was built and a gray skin put up in place of original exterior. A short tower made of glass was placed at the mall's northern entrance. The interior floors were redone as well. Oakway Center new graphics incorporated an oak leaf into the logo for the exterior signs in an effort to make them more appealing and fit into the new dycor better. New lighting on the outside of the center and landscaping designed to redirect traffic and improve parking at the facility in order to increase safety for pedestrians were part of the renovations as well. Making the traffic flow simpler was a large part of the goal. In order to achieve these goals the center's access points were reduced and the parking areas realigned. Oakway Center is adding new tenants as part of the renovations being done. The goal of Oakway Center is to provide visitors a chance to shop in a relaxing atmosphere. Everything that can be done to improve the development and attract new patrons is being done. The center is adding new tenants as well in its efforts to revitalize the centers business. If you are ever in the area it is worth it to stop and give Oakway Center a try."
"Oregon Caves National Monument Oregon","Oregon","Oregon Caves National Monument Oregon","The Oregon Caves National Monument is located in southwest Oregon and is situated in the Siskiyou Mountains. The mountain range is a coastal one that passes through the states of California and Oregon and extends for a hundred miles along the coast. The monument is most noted for its marble caves. The caves are small and narrow with winding passageways that appear to go on for miles. The marble caves are one of the nations' most diverse geological realm. As explorers walk through the caverns they learn about geology and underground life. The marble caves have a complex ecosystem that consists of many different creatures. Some of the animals and insect life that can be found in the cave include daddy longlegs, moths, bats, and even crickets. The nearest city to the monument is Cave Junction. In order to get to the monument visitors are required to take a steep mountainous road with sharp curves. Oregon Caves National Monument covers 488 acres of land and is one of the smaller monuments in the state. The cave was discovered in 1874 by a local man named Elijah Davis. Once the attraction become popular, developers opened the caves to capitalize on Oregon tourism. Later in 1909, President William Howard Taft designated the caves a national monument. Initially, the monument was managed by the United States Forest Service but was later transferred to the National Park Service. The cave became an instant national attraction that drew thousands of visitors to the monument over the years. Improper upkeep and natural wear created a rubbled mess on the interior of the marble caves. It was in the 1980's that the National Park Service decided to remove over a thousand tons of rubble from the cave in an effort to start restoration. Once all of the rubble was removed - archeologists and researchers discovered thousands of new formations that had been buried for years. All asphalt trails, cabins, and transformers that were located above the cave were demolished and removed in order to prevent oils or sewage from leaking down in to the marble caves. Visitors can visit the caves by purchasing a ticket for a cave tour. The tours are arranged on a first-come, first-serve basis and arriving early to the monument is recommended in order to participate in a tour. The fee for a tour is $8.50 for adults and $5 for children. Discount rates are available for groups of twelve or more. There are annual and life time passes available that can be purchased for additional charges. During the tours, visitors are not allowed to touch any formations they see in the cave. The marble cave formations are easily breakable and can become discolored from the oils on human skin. During the winter, the cave tours are closed to the public. Each year, almost a hundred thousand people attend Oregon Caves National Monument in order to view its history and scenic views. The landscape of the monument is rich in a variety of plants and animals. Wildflowers, amphibians, birds, and conifers have all made their home in the area."

"Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area","Oregon","Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area - Reedsport, OR - Park on Coast","When it comes to having fun on the coast, the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, Reedsport, OR, is the place. This National Recreation Area (NRA) extends for 50 miles, going from Coos Bay on the south end, up to Florence on the north. This stretch of sand dunes goes from the coast to about two and a half miles inland in places. The sand dunes are generally low, but some of them are up to 500 feet high. In this narrow strip of land, there are many places for fun. To start with, there are more than 30 lakes which provide ample places for fishing and swimming. Boating, canoeing, and even scuba-diving are also available at some of the other lakes. The mouth of the Umpqua River, near Reedsport, is well known for having the largest sport fishing fleet on the coast of Oregon, and boats can be chartered there for deep sea fishing. Fresh and salt water fishing will yield salmon, sturgeon, bass, steelhead, shad, crab, and more. Three areas of the NRA have been marked off just for off-road vehicles, special maps show where these areas are. They are closed to other uses - giving riders one of the best places on the coast and miles of sand dunes to ride on. The highest dunes are in the Umpqua Riding Area. There are designated routes and off-road vehicles can be rented from various places along the coast. Permits for off-road vehicles will have to be obtained. Fourteen hiking trails provide hikers with a wide variety of sights as they walk through wetlands, forests, and sand dunes. Eleven places are designated for beach parking, and there are thirteen campgrounds. Some of the campgrounds are open all year, and some provide facilities for RV's. A visitor center provides guests with information about the area, and maps showing where the different locations are. The center is in Reedsport, on Route 101, and it also contains exhibits about natural history of the NRA, and a video about the dune area. Horseback riding is available, too.

If you prefer hiking to riding the dunes, or to the water, there are plenty of places to find solitude in the forests. A number of trails offer hiking, too, and these can be moderate to difficult as some of the trails go up to 1,000 feet."
"Oregon Shakespeare Festival","Oregon","Oregon Shakespeare Festival - Ashland, Oregon - An Award Winning Festival","The Oregon Shakespeare Festival was founded in 1935. It is one of the largest and oldest professional non-profit theatres in the United States. The festival season runs from February through October. During that timeframe, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival produces eleven plays using three stages. Typically, a season at the festival will include three plays on an outdoor stage, which is called the Elizabethan Stage or the Allen Pavilion. Five plays are usually produced in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, and the other three take place in the New Theatre. The festival also includes non-Shakespearean plays, although there are normally three to five Shakespearean plays each season. The Elizabethan Stage is modeled after the 1599 Fortune Theatre in London. The stage itself is trapezoidal. There is a shingled roof with a windowed gable. In keeping with Elizabethan tradition, one of the actors opens the window prior to every performance, runs a flag up the pole while a trumpet sounds, and doffs his cap to the audience. This signifies that a play is in progress. The Paul Allen Pavilion contains the control room, balcony seating, and two box seats. When attending a performance, patrons will receive a Playbill, which includes the cast list, a synopsis of the play, and any statements from the directors. More detailed information on the play, the playwright, and the actors can be found in the annual Souvenir Program. The Souvenir Program provides biographies and pictures of all of the actors. It also lists many of the people who work behind the scenes. In the warmer months (typically from June through October), there is a Green Show prior to the actual play. The Green Show has transformed over the years. Now, patrons can expect to see anything from dance groups to jugglers. The Green Show has also been known to feature a fire show or clowns doing ballet on stilts. The Green Show may also consist of individual performers, bands, or improvisation. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival also generates support through membership. They offer four different levels of membership: sustainer, donor, patron, and benefactor. Sustainers pay the least to become members, and benefactors pay the most. All four levels of membership offer the ability to purchase tickets before they go on sale to the general public.

"Pacific Dunes Golf Course","Oregon","Pacific Dunes Golf Course, Bandon, Oregon ? A Links-Style Course Ranked As One of the Best in the Country","Pacific Dunes is one of three golf courses at the Bandon Dunes Resort in Bandon, Oregon. A fourth course is slated to open in 2010. The resort is set on Oregon's rugged coastline about 100 feet above the Pacific Ocean, making it an ideal location to capture the essence of Scotland's great links courses. At the resort, golfers will experience untamed shores that go on for miles, and grassy, primeval dunes that run out to the ocean. In describing the land used for the resort's courses, GOLF Magazine had this to say: Probably the finest land made available for a golf course in America since Alistair Mackenzie was shown the site for Cypress Point Club on Monterey Peninsula...'' Pacific Dunes was the second of the resort's courses to be built, opening in 2001. Designed by a Scotsman, David McLay Kidd, the course is situated on a bluff high above the Pacific Ocean and plays along the native dunes to reveal ocean views on nearly every hole. In describing the routing, course architect McLay Kidd had this to say: I suspect that any golfer would have found some of the same holes, like the par-4 13th along the ocean, but it was an enormous responsibility to find the best possible routing on a site of such potential. The rippling fairways are mostly as we found them; so are the natural bunkers at the 2nd, 7th, 11th, 13th, 16th, and 18th holes, which guided our routing. Our layout is short enough to give every golfer hope, but its rugged nature will test every facet of your game.'' The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 6,633 yards from the back (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 72.9 and a slope rating of 133 on Fescue grass. From the next set of Green tees, the course plays to only 6,142 yards, making it a relatively short course, which is good since it's for walkers only. In designing the course, course architect McLay Kidd had to move very little earth, since the land has been described as near perfect'' for a wild, classic links-style golf course. Pacific Dunes also features some monstrous'' greens, sometimes longer than 100 feet from front to back. That makes lag putting a vital skill, as well as a solid bump-and-run game to keep the ball low and out of the often vicious ocean winds. Since its opening, Pacific Dunes has received many honors and awards, including rankings among the top golf courses in the country. GOLF Magazine rated Bandon Dunes #1 among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play, Golfweek also ranked it #1 on its list of Best Resort Courses and #2 on its list of Best Modern Courses, while Golf Digest ranked it #2 among America's Greatest Public Golf Courses. The resort features a Practice Center that covers 32 acres just east of the Pacific Dunes course, allowing players to work on all aspects of their game. Lessons and a golf shop are also available. A variety of lodging options are also available, as well as several full-service restaurants, lounges, hot tub, sauna, exercise room, and locker rooms. h h h"

PDX is also known for the free wi-fi available throughout the terminal zone and the children's play zones.

"Portland Japanese Garden Speaks to All the Senses - Portland Japanese Garden","Oregon","Portland Japanese Garden Speaks to All the Senses - Portland Japanese Garden","Professor Takuma Tono, the designer of the Portland Japanese Garden, said, A Japanese Garden is not only a place for the cultivation of trees and flowering shrubs, but one that provides secluded leisure, rest, repose, meditation, and sentimental pleasure... The Garden speaks to all the senses, not just to the mind alone. His creation certainly lives up to Tono's expectations. Using a mix of plants, stones, and water, the harmonious 5.5 acres constitute five different individual gardens with distinct styles: the Flat Garden, the Strolling Pond Garden, the Tea Garden, the Natural Garden, and the Sand and Stone Garden. The Flat Garden is the most formal of the five. It encircles a hundred-floormat Pavilion hall and is comprised of deep evergreen and contrasting white sand in the shape of water to create a careful seascape. Symbolism and meaning is rampant in this flat garden of complete balance. The largest of the five gardens, the Strolling Pond garden is so named because of the two pond in its interior. Within the Upper Pond is the island of Hokkaido, which visitors can reach by crossing the Moon Bridge. By the Lower Pond, the Zig Zag bridge wanders through the flowers, statues, and decorative stones. The ceremonial Tea House, named Kashin Tei or Flower Heart house, is surrounded by two gardens. Originally the tea house was built in Japan, but it was disassembled and then reassembled in Portland. The Tea Ceremony is very important to Japanese culture and is performed very precisely, so the garden isn't excessively decorative in order to not detract from the ritual. Every element in the garden - every flower, water feature, and stepping stone - was specifically chosen to contribute to the peace of the Tea Ceremony. The Natural Garden is a windy path lined with ponds, waterfalls, shallow streams, trees shrubs, ferns, and moss that have been left to grow naturally. The path through the garden is meant to b symbolic of the spiritual journey of life. The abstract style used in the Sand and Stone Garden is typically used in Zen monasteries. Here, sand is carefully raked into designs with weathered stones placed on top. It is a simple yet unique garden method and is worth a look for anyone curious about Japanese culture. When Portland and Sapporo, Japan became sister cities in 1958, locals gained an interest in Japanese culture until the Mayor decided to create a traditional Japanese Garden for citizens to view and learn from. In 1967, the Portland Japanese Gardens were finally opened to the public. Today it receives more than 200,000 visitors annually, and it has been viewed by many important Japanese officials. His Excellency Nobuo Matsunaga, the Ambassador from Japan to the United States, said the garden was the most beautiful and authentic Japanese garden in the world outside of Japan. His Excellency Ambassador Kunihiko Saito, on the other hand, exclaimed, I believe this garden to be the most authentic Japanese garden, including those in Japan."

"Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club, Ghost Creek Course, North Plains, Oregon - A Traditional Robert Crupp, Parkland-Style Golf Course","Oregon","Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club, Ghost Creek Course, North Plains, Oregon - A Traditional Robert Crupp, Parkland-Style Golf Course","Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club features 36 holes of championship golf on its two courses, Witch Hollow and Ghost Creek. Both are Robert Crupp designs, and both have been ranked among the best golf courses in the country and have hosted professional tournaments. Ghost Creek, which opened in 1992, is a parkland-style course that's been described as traditional and challenging, yet fair.'' The course is set amid rolling hills and framed by wispy Fescue grasses. There are a good many trees, but the course is not especially tight, nor is it a links-style course. The one element that appears, disappears and reappears consistently throughout is the course's namesake, Ghost Creek. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 6,839 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.8 and a slope rating of 140 on Bent grass. The course is much longer on the front nine than the back, and the front nine is also considered the more difficult of the two nines. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4, where the course has been said to turn ghoulish.'' This long, uphill par-5 plays to 533 yards from the Black tees, and features a fairway that slopes severely from right to left toward the creek. The green is also quite challenging, as it's crested and nestled among trees. It's also multi-tiered and has been said to play like three different putting surfaces.'' Hole No. 9 is considered to be the most difficult hole on the course, a long par-4 that plays to 469 yards from the back tees. Bunkers and water come into play just past the midway point of the fairway, and approach shots must find a green tucked alongside the water hazard. Even on the NIKE Tour, the average score on this hole is a half-shot over par. The back nine plays several hundred yards shorter than the front and features three par-3 holes, two of them short. One of the most noteworthy holes on the back side is No. 18, which again brings Ghost Creek into play. The hole is another par-4 that plays to 454 yards from the longest tees, with water coming into play on the right as the hole approaches the green. If the pin is back and right, that can add further to the difficulty, making this a very challenging hole. Since opening, Ghost Creek has received much acclaim, including being ranked among GOLF Magazine's Top 100 Places You Can Play in 2005. The course also hosted the NIKE Tour Championships in 1993 and 1994. Practice facilities at Pumpking ridge include a driving range and short-game practice area.

"Running Y Ranch Resort Golf Course","Oregon","Running Y Ranch Resort Golf Course, Klamath Falls, Oregon - The Only Arnold Palmer Golf Course in Oregon","The Running Y Ranch Resort offers 6,000 acres of land devoted to outdoor activities, including an 18-hole, championship golf course, which is the only Arnold Palmer design in the state of Oregon. The course plays through picturesque wetlands and mature pine forests in the heart of southern Oregon's Cascade Mountain Range. The par-72 course, which opened in 1997, plays to 7,138 yards from the longest (Palmer) tees, with a USGA rating of 73.4 and a slope rating of 132 on Blue grass. The course features generous fairways, a fair amount of water, more than 100 sand bunkers, and fast, undulating greens. The front nine holes open along the edge of Klamath Lake and its restored wetlands and flowing meadows, while the back nine begins on an open plain with some water features and spectacular Scottish mounding, then winds back through Payne Canyon. Palmer is known to have a philosophy of leave it as it lies'' when it comes to course design, and he's been said to consider the Running Y course one of his best designs. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4, which has been described as a beautiful par-4.'' The hole plays to 409 yards from the Palmer tees, but a short 325 yards from the Whites. The challenge on this hole is the water that runs from tee to green on the right, and the fairway bunkers that are reachable off the tee. The green is also a challenge, as it's long, narrow, tucked behind water, and slopes away from approaching shots. Hole No. 5 is the signature hole for the course, a short par-3 at only 147 yards from the longest tees. The entire hole is surrounded by water, and while there's no forced carry per se, the green is cleverly tucked behind the curving water hazard. Hole No. 16 is said to be Palmer's favorite on the course. This par-4 plays to 446 yards from the back tees and is rather straight, but the challenge comes from a tree-lined fairway and a reachable bunker on the left. Approach shots to the green play downhill, making the green somewhat difficult to hold. Since opening, the Running Y Ranch golf course has received a number of awards. Golfweek magazine ranked it #8 among the Best Courses You Can Play in the State in 2008-2009, while Golf Digest ranked it #51 among the Top 100 Public Courses in America in 2003-2004, and Best New Public Course in America in 1998. The resort also features a ranch-style Lodge with a fully equipped golf shop, Snack Bar, guest rooms, a sports & fitness center, and the Ranch House Restaurant.

"Sea Lion Caves","Oregon","Sea Lion Caves - Florence, OR - Caves on West Coast","The Sea Lion Caves at Florence, OR, are an excellent way to see live sea lions at work and play. The caves are about 11 miles north of Florence and are a must-see place to go when passing through the area. Many types of sea lions migrate with the weather, but the type that are at the Sea Lion Caves, called Stellar sea lions, do not migrate. This means that there are always some of these wild sea lions there for you to see. A few of them, however, will travel toward Alaska and back. The cave itself is massive. It is more than 200 feet high, and longer than a football field. Elevators were added in 1961, and people can easily get down to a viewing area above the sea lions. The Cave is privately owned and is considered to be the largest sea cave in the world. It was discovered in 1888. Sea lions breed in the summer, but during the spring, you will see the bulls sparring for the right to a harem, which count about 10 to 20 cows. In June, the cubs are born. At times, there could be as many as 200 sea lions in the cave. It is the only place on the US mainland where these seals reside. Sea lions themselves can become quite large. The female is considerably smaller than the male, and she will often weigh about 700 pounds and will be seven or eight feet long. The bull, however, will grow up to twelve feet long, and can weigh up to 1,500 pounds. A baby sea lion will weigh about 50 pounds. The stellar seal is a northern seal and is unique from many other seals. One unique aspect of them is that they have external ears. They also have rear feet, or flippers, that point to the rear. Sea Lion Caves presents the visitor with two different ways to view the sea lions. There is one viewing area on top where the sea lions that are outside on a rocky ledge can be seen. During the summer months, they are mostly outside. The other way is to take the elevator down to the viewing area, which is inside the cave. There is a cost to go down the elevator. There are some pay telescopes on top, but there are not any in the cave itself in the viewing area. It is recommended that visitors bring binoculars in order to get the best look at the seals. Taking photos are not allowed in the cave. Because the Sea Lion Caves, Florence, OR, is so close to the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area at Reedsport, you have a great opportunity to see and do other things nearby. At the Dunes, you can find many activities - including swimming, fresh water and deep sea fishing, horseback riding, ATV's you can rent and ride the dunes with, and much more. Elk herds can also be seen in the area. By going to the Dean Creek Elk Viewing Area, it is possible to see hundreds of elk at a time.

"Seaside Aquarium","Oregon","Seaside Aquarium - Seaside, Oregon - Beach, Seals, Aquarium","Seaside Aquarium is privately owned and one of the oldest aquariums on the West Coast. Established in 1937, some of the founders' decedents remain active with the aquarium today. The aquarium can boast having one of the best captive breeding records for Harbor Seals in the world, many of their seals are third or fourth generation. While there is more to see and enjoy than just seals at Seaside, they are the main attraction. The online reviews all say some version of, It was worth a visit just to feed the seals,'' or that Feeding the seals was the highlight for a two and a half year old.'' Another online reviewer said, The first thing you see upon entering is the seal area ... maybe ten feet by twenty-five feet, with a few smooth rocks. More than a dozen seals are clamoring for your attention and slapping their sides, begging for the little pieces of fish you can throw at them.'' Visitors to the aquarium can purchase fish to feed the seals. The seals eat 19,000 pounds of capelin and 19,000 pounds of herring in a year. Most of the seals were born at the Seaside Aquarium. The National Marine Fisheries Service rescued the only one not born at the aquarium in 1978. The aquarium hasn't taken in any wild seals since then. From the north or south, Seaside Aquarium is easy to get to by taking U.S. highway 101 to Seaside, Oregon. The physical address is 200 North Promenade.

The displays change with the seasons and some allow you to interact with them. There are microscopes to view the tiniest creatures, and staff members are available to answer questions. The aquarium has a Touch Tank where you can touch starfish, sea urchins and other sea life. A reviewer said, The tiny, dark Seaside Aquarium has its charms, partly for its old-fashioned, mom-and-pop tourist-trap vibe, and partly for some interesting fish and enthusiastic seals.'' Decorating it in this fashion was done on purpose. When it opened in 1937, the intent was to entertain the masses and the dark interior was supposed to make visitors feel as if they were swimming through an ocean cave. Today the intent is to educate and get the community involved with the aquarium and the ocean beyond. Seaside is a leader in the regional Marine Mammal Stranding Network. They've added an Interpretive Center and helped start a Watershed Estuary Beach Discovery Program. The aquarium is modernizing and expanding their focus."

It did become swallowed by Portland as the city began to expand for commerce, but Sellwood still offers that small town feeling and Lawrence Welk could still draw a crowd. Other districts of Portland offer more modernity. But Sellwood is all about sundaes in the park, civic events, and galleries. Gallery 7126 is a combination art gallery and espresso bar. It has a Moorish style Masonic lodge to house the varying art. Moorish styling exists in several parts of Sellwood with the Moreland Theater, which was a first run movie house in the 1920's.

Forest and large boulders surround the eight creek pools found there. While there is no camping permitted at the hot springs fishing, swimming, camping and water skiing can be done at lakes near them. Getting to Terwilliger Hot Springs is easy take State Route 126 to mile marker number 45. Take a right at the mile marker onto the road close to the sign for Cougar Reservoir, pass the bridge, and take a right. Follow the road for approximately three miles until you reach the damn. Go to the right for four miles and you will notice a small lake to the right and a sign for a waterfall. Parking is on the left side of the road with a trail on the lake's north side. It is a hike of around a quarter mile through the woods to the hot springs from here. The geothermal pools that make up Terwilliger Hot Springs are in Willamette National Forest which is fifty-three miles east from Eugene, Oregon. Rider Creek is where the springs drain and it drains into the Cougar Reservoir. The springs can be found approximately one quarter of a mile from Auferheide Memorial Drive or the Forest Service Road 19. The Terwilliger Hot Springs are managed by Hoodoo Recreation Services. Four of the pools were built with river stones by visitors to the area with sizes ranging from three to twelve feet across and being up to three feet deep. The source of the hot springs is located above the highest pool; it is a spring flowing out of the face of a rock at an estimated temperature of 112 degrees Fahrenheit. This creates a waterfall that flows into the three pools below it. The floor of the pools is mainly bedrock unless they have not been cleaned recently then sand, gravel and debris can be found there as well. In 2009 volunteers and a stones-man based in Eugene renovated the pools. The concrete was removed and natural mortar was used to build the pools. This made the pools easier to keep clean and increased the appeal as a place to relax and soak in the water. The cost of the renovations is estimated to have been $40,000. The hot springs do not have a strong sulphur odor. The cost of using the hot springs is five dollars each person, payments are made to the person that guides you down the trail to the springs. There are people of all ages at the Terwilliger Hot Springs and clothing is optional. This means that if you have smaller children you may want to go alone. When visiting the hot springs it is vital to remember that the rocks are slippery so you must take care. Those in the Eugene, Oregon area that just want to relax in a hot spa while enjoying the outdoors should make it a point to visit the Terwilliger Hot Springs found there."
"Terwilliger Hot Springs","Oregon","Terwilliger Hot Springs, Eugene, Oregon","Terwilliger Hot Springs are also known as the Cougar Hot Springs in Eugene, Oregon. These hot springs are actually located outside of the city limits of Eugene in the Willamette National Forest. The hot springs flow from a tiered grade, meaning that they flow from high to low with pools at a lower elevation. The pools become cooler at the lower elevation because the water is further and further from the original source. It is here that individuals can get into the hot springs. The cooler water makes it more comfortable. Hours are day use only, meaning that once dusk hits the area is closed. The fee for the hot springs is tied into the forest permit and is $5. This is for the entire day. To get to the park one must go to the Rider Creek Arm of Cougar Reservoir. The hot springs are 53.3 miles east of Eugene. By taking I5 and I105 from Eugene visitors can end up on Highway 126 which will lead to the reservoir. Forest Road 19 is at the Cougar turnoff and visitors will be on that for 39 miles until they reach a right turn towards the dam. It is 3.4 miles to the dam, and another 4.3 to the trailhead for the hot springs. At the parking lot visitors will have to back track a small ways to get to the trailhead for the hot springs. The path will take .1 miles to get to the springs along the spur trail, which goes down to the larger swimming area. Terwilliger is one of the more popular hot springs in the state because it is technically free to go to the springs; visitors just have to pay to get into the park. Nudity can be expected at the springs and the swimming hole as there are no rules to eliminate this. So for visitors with children it is best to get a look before allowing the children down into the swimming area. The hot springs were constructed for use by residents. They are quite rustic now since they have been there for many years. The top pool nearer the source is going to be the hottest, but once visitors reach 12 feet down the water becomes cooler. There are a total of eight pools all ranging in size from three to twelve feet across. The depth of the pools is two to three feet. The top pool is 112 degrees Fahrenheit. The floor of the pools is usually bedrock, but some have gravel, sand and debris. A waterfall can be seen providing the spring water into one of the larger pools, the swimming area. The forest does ask that all visitors do their part to keep the water clean of all human debris. The area sees more than a million visitors a year, and to keep it open visitors must do their part. For a forest retreat on a day trip the hot springs are worth a trip."

Thousands of works, most of them gifts from museum founders and community members, are on display. It is internationally recognized and serves over 350,000 visitors each year. This attraction was founded by seven leaders from business and cultural institutions in 1892 when they started the Portland Art Association. The first collection they purchased comprised of approximately one hundred plaster casts of sculptures from the Greek and Roman eras. This collection quickly gained attention and popularity until it became one of the most important cultural resources in the city. The Association continued collecting works until in 1905 they were too big to remain in the library where they were originally displayed and the museum moved to its present location. The museum didn't acquire its first original piece of art until 1908. The pieces included Afternoon Sky and Harney Desert by Childe Hassam, an American impressionist painter. It continued to grow until it became one of the leading cultural institutions in the Pacific Northwest, and it still continues to grow. The museum's permanent collection includes 112,000 square feet of galleries, with more then 42,000 objects from a huge range of periods and styles created from ancient times to today.

Education and Outreach programs are a fundamental aspect of the museums mission. It provides classes, lectures, tools for researchers, community programs, educator resources, and more.

One of these acres is home to the Oregon Vortex, it is infamous for being an area with a long history of defying the laws of physics. Legend has it, as far back as the 1930's, that this area is a spherical force, half above and half below the ground with an area of approximately 165 feet in diameter. There have been many reported occurrences on this property; the most common claim is that people, depending on where they stand within the vortex, it makes them grow smaller or taller, objects such as balls actually role uphill and it can cause a compass or other type of instrument to malfunction and go haywire. Every year scientists, researches, psychics and thousands of tourist visit the Oregon Vortex, to experience their own version of the unexplainable. Some people even visit the vortex, under the belief it can ease the suffering of back pain, while others report feelings of being dizzy when standing inside the vortex. Either way, this site is either home of unexplainable oddities or a popular tourist attraction. The Oregon Vortex is also an area shrouded deep in mystery and folklore, dating as far back as the Native American Indians. The Indians considered the area to be The Forbidden Ground'', their horses refused to go near the area and as a result neither did they. The area is also devoid of any other type of animal as well, as most will not go anywhere close to it. In the 1920's, a geologist by the name of John Lister settled in the area and was at a loss to explain the strange occurrences. He began performing all kinds of experiments and tests, then began to develop theories surrounding his findings. He first opened the grounds to the general public in 1930, and continued to perform experiments and probe the mysteries of this area until he died in 1959. It has been reported that the ghost of John Lister has been spotted at various locations around the property, most prominently in the House of Mystery. In the Oregon Vortex Visiting Center, hangs a portrait of what is believed to be John Lister. The House Of Mystery was built in 1890, by the Old Grey Eagle Mining Company. It was originally designed to be an assayers office. Miners who came to the office to have gold weighed, reported that the scales in the office were very inaccurate, and were at a loss to explain this phenomena. The house slid off its foundation in 1910, coming to rest at an odd angle and is still there to the present day."

The South course is considered the more traditional'' of the two courses, and is John Fought design that plays through rolling hills and native trees, especially on its southern side, which is bordered by forest lands that are home to the deer and other wildlife that will often visit the course. The course features a fair amount of water from greenside ponds and their adjoining waterways, which run along a number of holes. But what really distinguishes this course are its 114 white-sand bunkers. Even though the course is tree-lined, many golfers find the bunkers to be the most penalizing and club-altering element on the course, and it's inevitable that players will be holding a rake at some point during a round. Hole No. 6 alone features 16 sand traps, and there's even a bunker in one of the double-headed (shared) greens. The greenside bunkers are also a challenge, especially when the wind is blowing. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,172 yards from the longest (Championship) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.3 and a slope rating of 134. From the Blue tees the course plays to 6,809 yards, and 6,201 yards from the Whites. Much of that length comes from a fair share of long, demanding par-4 holes. The greens have been described as being as good as it gets,'' rolling fast and true. The slope of the greens is said to be not exceedingly difficult, but there are some unusual elements to be found on the putting surfaces, including two double-headed (shared) greens and the aforementioned bunker in a green, which separates the putting surfaces for Holes No. 3 and No. 5. Among the accolades the South course has received include being named the 8th-Most Difficult Golf Course in Oregon and Southwest Washington by the Oregon Golf Association in 2006, and being named the 15th-Best Golf Course in Oregon by Golf Digest in 2007-2008. The par-4 No. 17 hole also earned the title of 5th-Best Hole from The Oregonian in 2003. The course has also hosted numerous professional events, including being the first golf course in Oregon since 1960 to host a PGA Tour event. The course also features a 70,000-square-foot clubhouse with a lounge and lobby bar, patio buffet, live entertainment, and dining at The Vintage Room Restaurant.

"Tillamook Cheese Factory","Oregon","Tillamook Cheese Factory - Tillamook, Oregon - Many Cheeses and Over 20 Ice Cream Flavors","Throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, Tillamook County was home to many dairy farms and industries. In 1909, the Tillamook County Creamery Association (TCCA) was formed in order to regulate and consolidate the various dairy products of the county. A plant was developed by the consolidation in the 1940s, which became known as the Tillamook Cheese Factory. A visitor center and gift shop were also built adjacent to the plant. TCCA is located west of Portland, Oregon, near the Pacific Coast, on Highway 101 North. It is southeast of Tillamook Bay and Bay City in Tillamook County. The TCCA is featured by the Oregon Coast Visitors Association and the Tillamook Chamber of Commerce. The Visitor Center is open daily from 8:00am to 6:00pm from Labor Day to Mid-June. From Mid-June to Labor Day, the Visitor Center is open from 8:00am to 8:00pm. It is closed on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In celebration of their 100 year anniversary on August 1, 2009, the Visitor Center is offering musical entertainment, product sampling, and games for children. The Center admits over one million visitors per year. Some of the products manufactured at the plant include cheese, ice cream, butter, and yogurt. They create over twenty flavors of ice cream. The plant remains famous, however, for its quality cheeses, such as five styles of cheddar, three Jack cheeses, Mozzarella, and Colby. There is also a kosher cheddar cheese and a couple of reduced fat cheeses. These products are marketed in loaves, shredded, or sliced. The quality and characteristics of Tillamook cheeses are attributed to several factors in its production. The first is the quality of the milk provided by dairy farmers. The Tillamook Cheese Factory is equipped with a Cheddarmaster machine. It is a large, stainless steel machine with a six-foot wide conveyor belt that drains whey from the curds. The factory was equipped with this automatic machine in 1990. After the curds are drained, an enzyme is added to coagulate the curd. Tillamook Cheese Factory uses a vegetable-based enzyme that is kosher and halal approved. Another key process is the specific aging process, which is used to develop the taste and consistency of the cheeses. The cheddar cheese, for example, is aged for no less than 60 days in a temperature controlled environment. Tillamook products have been received with acclaim, having won awards for both their cheeses and their ice cream at the National Milk Producers Federation contest and the Oregon Dairy Industries dairy products contest. Similarly, their business and financial acumen have been recognized by industry magazines like Dairy Foods and the Portland Business Journal. They have also been recognized by the International Dairy Foods Association. In 2005, the TCCA ensured that their products would not be made from cows given rBST. rBST is a protein hormone that is given to bovine animals to increase milk production. The suppliers of TCCA are certified not to use rBST and all of Tillamook's products are free from rBST. The Visitor Center includes a caf, that sells grilled cheese sandwiches and cheeseburgers. The gift shop sells their dairy products as well as numerous memorabilia, accessories, and collectables. In 2008, TCCA opened an online store to supplement their marketing."
"Timberline Lodge Ski Area","Oregon","Timberline Lodge Ski Area - Government Camp, Oregon - Ski Resort","Timberline Lodge is a showplace, a historic marvel that perfectly highlights both the craftsmanship of the past and the amazing setting of this ski area. Above the tree line at six thousand feet, this resort is located on the side of Mount Hood. The Timberline Ski Area is open twelve months out of the year and there is skiing well into the summer months. You'll find an alpine or downhill ski area as well as limited cross-country or Nordic skiing. Many Olympic and competitive teams practice here during the heat of summer. With 3,690 vertical feet in the winter and 2,616 feet in the summer, Timberline boasts longer, steeper slopes than anybody else in the Pacific Northwest. Located near the top of the tallest mountain in Oregon, in reality this 11,245-foot rock is an inactive volcano. Let's review the winter ski stats: -There are 41 trails. 50% percent of these are for intermediate skiers. The other 50% is divided between the beginner and advanced skier. -There are 1,415 acres of ski-able terrain. The average snow base is 175-200 inches per season. -There are five high-speed quad lifts. -Timberline can move almost 10,000 people per hour up the mountain. To get to Timberline from the Portland area, take State route 26 to the town of Government Camp. Just past Government Camp take the Timberline Highway up to the Lodge. In the winter the last five miles is plowed, but not snow-free. This is a steep road up to the lodge and snow tires or chains are often required so carry chains with you. During the snow season it is strongly advised that you have Oregon-approved snow tires. The winter season typically begins early to mid-November and continues through Memorial Day. Summer season is dependant on the weather but usually runs from June 1st through Labor Day. Fall skiing is Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in September and October. Again, this depends on the snow. In the summer, when you've finished skiing, there are other things to do as well. This online review highlights some of the choices. I could see families pouring out of the Magic Mile chairlift to a prime picnic spot at 7,000 feet and guests at the 1937 Timberline Lodge lounging by the swimming pool. Within the Mount Hood National Forest's 1 million acres of wilderness, visitors can hike hundreds of miles of trails, including the adventurous route to Hood's 11,240-foot summit. You can also angle from the shore of clear blue lakes or shoot down the Clackamas or Salmon rivers by kayak or raft.'' With the amazing exterior of Timberline Lodge and the breath-taking surroundings, there have been several movies shot at the Timberline lodge or in the immediate area. The classic horror movie, The Shining, immortalized the lodge in 1980. It's easy to see why movies are filmed here. When you first see Timberline Lodge, you realize it is a building that commands your undivided attention. A hand-made wonder, this lodge opened September 28, 1937. This magnificent building has always been more that just an addendum to the ski resort. Today it serves as an art museum as well as a lodge."

Lancaster also felt it would be a fitting memorial for Oregon pioneers who had a hard life homesteading. In 1918 the site was finished, and opened for millions of travelers a year. It is 733 feet above the Columbia River. Photographers have often found the vantage point one worth photographing, and taking photos from. They used to call the area Thor's Heights'' due to the basalt land, with volcanic lava flows, floods, and winds that were used to carve the Gorge. In 1971 it was named a National Natural Landmark. Vista House is 44 feet in diameter and 55 feet in height. The roof was copper for fifty years. During the restoration it was again restored to the green tile matte glaze of the original construction.

"Yaquina Bay Lighthouse","Oregon","Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, Newport, OR","The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse, Newport, OR, was built in 1871, when the port was very busy and ships needed the light to safely find the harbor. This more than 100 year-old lighthouse stands on the coast of Oregon - still watches over the harbor at Yaquina Bay overlooking the Pacific Ocean. At the time the lighthouse was built, Yaquina Bay was seen to be the next San Francisco, a major sea port on the west coast. For a while, it was the busiest seaport between Puget Sound and the Californian city. In order to help ensure that it would develop in that direction, a lighthouse was quickly constructed there - on the north side of the harbor. It was a wood construction building and the lighthouse keeper's house was attached to the lighthouse - which was rare - and is only one of a few lighthouses ever to be constructed that way on the West coast. Shortly afterward, the Commission that ordered the construction of the first lighthouse discovered that another location might actually be better for the light. The location of the new lighthouse, just a few miles away, was considered to be the ideal location. It was also decided that it should be more powerful than the first one. Its light would be capable of being seen up to 16 miles away, instead of just 6 - which was the limit of the first smaller lighthouse. Once the new lighthouse was built and ready for operations, just three years later, the Yaquina Bay light was decommissioned, and its light removed. Since that time, the house has been used occasionally by various groups performing construction projects for the government - but the light never shined again until 1996. The old historic light keeper's home has since been renovated and is available for public tours. The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse is the main feature of the Yaquina State Park and it is surrounded by a forest of spruce and pine trees. Although tourists can see the lighthouse keeper's house, and the lighthouse tower, the actual light room is closed to the public. The lighthouse is fully automated and does not need anyone attending it. The light keeper's house is filled with period furniture, and is considered by some to be the best display of what life was like for a lighthouse keeper and his family. There is an excellent gift shop in the basement of the Lighthouse. Also, movies are shown in a theater that presents some of the history of the Yaquina Bay Lighthouse. It is a popular spot and many tourists travel to see the lighthouse while they are visiting the Park and Newport, OR. Because of its mostly vacant history the lighthouse has had over the years, several ghost stories have arisen about the lighthouse. This has attracted many visitors to the lighthouse, and visitors are invited to read about some of them when they visit. The lighthouse is located right off of the Yaquina Bay Bridge. Currently, there is no parking for tour buses available, and there is not any handicap accessibility, either. The lighthouse is open to the public and there is no charge for the tours, although donations will be asked for. The Yaquina Bay Lighthouse is open all year, and closed on major holidays."
