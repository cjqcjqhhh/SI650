Over the years there has been a lot of controversy regarding the development of the ski area. The area is part of the United States Forest Service. In the 1930's the USFS began construction on a ski lodge on the western slope. A full development was planned, but several Native American tribes and community groups opposed this idea. Therefore, the shops, restaurants, and numerous lodges were never built. In 1979 the USFS was able to build a new lodge, pave the road, and expand the parking. This is when four ski lifts were added. The forest service was also able to create 50 acres of trails on to the original land. Expansion at Arizona Snowbowl has been turned down several times. In 2008 the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals again ruled in favor of the tribes. However, this decision was reversed by the full court. Arizona Snowbowl has the go ahead to reclaim water to make artificial snow. They could also add 2 new lifts, 10 more tails, a half pipe, and expand the lodges. In January 2009 the US Supreme Court saw a new appeal. The chair lifts they have now can handle 425 to 1200 visitors a day. The aspen ski lift is 1600 feet in length with vertical feet of 250. Hart Prairie handles 750 passengers with a length of 3200 feet and a 650 feet vertical lift. The Agassi goes up 6,450 feet with 2000 vertical feet. Though expansion is on hold, the ski area is open for visitors."

"Barrio Historico","Arizona","Barrio Historico","A reminder of Tucson a hundred years ago is represented by what remains of the Barrio Historico. The facility is there today because it has been neglected and forgotten by the entire city not because it has been carefully preserved and cared for.

The residents of the Spanish and Mexican community that it is the center of have strong ethnic and cultural ties to the area. The difficulty maintaining the structure has lead to the decline of the area. The structure is reminiscent of another time with an uncertain future. The center of Tucson having been deserted over the years for the more open areas on the eastside have contributed to the Barrio Historico's decline.

"Bell Rock","Arizona","Bell Rock - Sedona, AZ - Red rock formation","Bell Rock is one of the most easily recognized red rock formations in Sedona, with its unusual stately shape and stunning color. It's one of the first rocks visible on entering the city, and it's the subject of many photographs as people wander through. Bell Rock is a favorite destination of many tourists, and can easily be traversed with a number of trails being available. In such a tranquil and beautiful location, Bell Rock offers the perfect place for picnicking and simply enjoying the scenery. The rock is one of four energy vortexes in the area, with many people reporting to feel the electrical currents swirling up around them as they walk through. This offers some fantastic experiences and is well worth the trip is only to experience the unusual and pleasant sensation. There are a number of easy hiking trails to and from Bell Rock Vista, and for more experienced hikers they could quite happily make their way to the top of the rock (or as far as can be gone without ropes) for some stunning views of the area. However, the usual trails are considered easy to moderate, and shouldn't pose a problem for anyone with a basic level of fitness. The area is home to a huge number of bird, plant and animal species, and it's worth walking through slowly to see what can be spotted. Coyote's, foxes and rabbits all call the area home, and it's possible to see them if it's quiet enough. Lizards are easy to spot as they scurry across the rocks, and hummingbirds and even hawks and eagles can be seen in the distance. Many visitors recommend that people should spend as much time there as possible, as the area is so tranquil it would be a shame to simply rush through. Bring a picnic and a book, and find a little spot to spend a peaceful afternoon. For visitors planning to spend a day in the area, a Red Rock Pass is required. These will only cost around $5 and allow access to the whole area. It isn't hard to see why Bell Rock is so popular. With beautiful vistas, scenic views and the most stunning colors, not to mention the incredible energy that can be felt there, it's well worth the trip for a great day out. If possible, head down there at sunrise or sunset to see the rocks really light up when the sun hits them, or for a really tranquil experience go there at night with a flashlight and enjoy the warm glow. Bell Rock is located just past the village of Old Creek, near Sedona, and a number of parking spots can be found along the road towards it."

The structure houses agricultural areas, a desert, rain forest, 900,000 gallon ocean and a human habitat. The managers and designers that began the project had an interest in space travel and wanted to explore the possibility of colonies on Mars or the Moon. They hoped to determine the effects of living in a system that was sealed off from the rest of the world and figure out how to solve the problems that would arise.

"Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona Exudes Tribal History","Arizona","Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona Exudes Tribal History","	Canyon de Chelly National Monument is located in northeastern Arizona on land that belongs to the Navajo Nation. This is the only National Park that consists entirely of American Indian trust land and a Navajo community still exists within the boundaries of the national monument. Established in 1931, Canyon de Chelly National Monument stretches over 131 miles (about 84,000 acres) and consists of three canyons: de Chelly, Monument, and del Muerto. These canyons were formed when headwaters cut through the adjacent Chuska Mountains. The monument was created in order to protect and preserve early Native American structures and artifacts indicative of life in this portion of the country. Both the Navajo and the Anasazi (ancient Pueblo) tribes once inhabited this land which, in addition to ruins, features many spectacular geologic formations. The National Park Service and the Navajo Nation work together to maintain the park and help lessen the impact of tourism on the area. Most individuals choose to explore the park via a self-driven auto tour. These tours remain on the rims of the canyons. They are safe and provide a picturesque view of the area and many of the ruins and interesting natural formations. The South Rim is a 36-mile round trip drive that takes about 2 hours to accomplish and provides 7 overlook areas. From this rim, visitors can catch a glimpse of Spider Rock, the park's main attraction, an 800-foot-high sandstone formation that rises from the canyon floor at the junction of de Chelly and Monument Canyons. Easy to recognize, Spider Rock has been used in many television commercials, TV shows, and movies. The North Rim, which is just a little shorter, also takes about 2 hours to traverse and provides 4 overlooks that explore Canyon del Muerto. The canyon floors can only be explored via a 4-wheel-drive vehicle that's operated by a park ranger or an authorized Navajo guide. The tours can be booked at the Visitor Center. Reservations are strongly suggested and tours are limited to a certain number each day to lessen the impact on the land. Two National Park Service-authorized stables offer equestrian tours of the Canyon de Chelly National Monument area. Tours can be booked by the hour with extended or overnight rides available. Reservations are advisable. Again, because of the fragility of the ruins, hiking is not permitted in the area unless accompanied by a ranger or authorized Navajo guide, except for the 2.5-mile White House Ruins Trail. This two-hour round trip descends from the South Rim to the canyon floor 600 feet below. All other hiking tours can be booked at the Visitor Center and usually consist of groups of about 15 individuals. A year-round campground is located near the Visitor Center and is booked on a first come, first serve basis. Group tent camping is also available.

Designated an archaeological reserve'' in 1892 and a national monument in 1918, the centerpiece of Casa Grande is a 4-story structure that dates from the late Hohokam period, probably around the 14th century. The ruin, often referred to as the Great House'' or Big House'', sits on flat terrain and is protected by a metal canopy that deflects the bright sun and heat of this portion of Arizona, where temperatures often soar to above 80 degrees during the winter and 110 in the summer. The purpose of the building itself is a mystery, though some believe it may have been an astrological observatory due to the way the building is positioned and aligned with the moon and sun. It measures about 60 feet by 40 feet and had walls that were more than a meter thick. Wooden beams supported the walls and staircases are visible inside. The exterior was fashioned from a material known as caliche, which is a naturally-occurring soil made of clay, sand, and calcium carbonate, typically found in the deserts of the American Southwest. Many of the Native American tribes in the region used caliche to build their structures. Because Casa Grande is a protected ruin in very fragile condition, visitors are not permitted to go inside. However, guests can explore the Big House from the outside, where much is visible, and visitors are welcome to photograph the ruin from fairly close proximity. Guided tours at the site of the ruins are available during the winter months, from December through April, and are conducted by National Park rangers. Schedules vary and reservations are not necessary. A Visitor Center near the entrance to the park is home to a small museum that includes artifacts and information about the Hohokam culture, one of four major prehistoric archaeological traditions of the American Southwest, particularly the Phoenix Basin. The Visitor Center also includes a small bookstore and a restroom area.

While the park is open year round, hours of operation may vary because of events, weather, and other factors. Castles n' Coasters features not one, but two of the best roller coasters in Arizona, according to critics. For coaster enthusiasts, nothing compares to Desert Storm, a wild coaster ride with unexpected vertical drops and hairpin turns taken at fast speeds. Guests can also enjoy riding the Patriot, which is milder and appropriate for the more timid roller coaster riders who are just getting their feet wet, so to speak. The park's coasters are the main attraction, but there are other rides for the whole family as well. One of the most popular non-coaster rides is the new Sky Diver. With this ride, guests climb into the car and feel the seat being lifted high above the park, only to suddenly plummet back down to the ground and stomach-dropping speeds. This ride is not for people with certain medical conditions, and guest should watch it in operation before boarding it so they know what to expect. For younger guests and those looking for fun rides that are a but tamer than the park's Sky Dive, Viking Sea Dragon is a good choice. This ride dips and rocks to simulate a boat at sea in a major storm. Guests can also go for a spin on the Magic Carpet ride, and if those are not tame enough, there's also a large Carousel, a beautiful ride featuring 60 hand-crafted horses and circus animals. The park also features a number of water rides, which guests can enjoy on hot days. Visitors can combine some cooling off with a bit of rivalry on the Bumper Boats, where riders can go out of your way to ram and slam other riders buddies into a wall while trying to avoid bumps from other riders. Visitors can also get out aggressions on the Bumper Cars or the Ram Rods, without the cooling effect of the water. The most popular water ride at Castles `n' Coasters, though, is the Splashdown, a log flume ride that takes riders through a logging town and zips through a waterfall and into a pool. There are lockets available at the facility for guests who don't want to spend all day in wet clothes, since many of these rides will end with the riders completely drenched. In addition to the thrill rides, the whole family can enjoy a round or two of miniature golf, time playing games in the arcade, or stroll through the Lil Kids area, where kids can enjoy some carnival rides designed especially for that age group. In addition, Castles `n' Coasters is available for private events and parties, as well as for corporate outings and other events. Hours of operation vary and may change without notice, so the park suggests that guests call before your visit to be certain that the attractions you want to visit are open.

"Cathedral Rock","Arizona","Cathedral Rock - Sedona, AZ - Stunning red rock formation","Cathedral Rock is a stunning outcrop of red rock in Sedona, Arizona, and visitors flock to it for some spectacular photo opportunities. There are great hiking trails both to the base of Cathedral Rock itself and to mountains opposite to get great views, and all will be well worth the trip. Cathedral Rock is one of the most famous rock formations in Sedona, and for anyone that's ever looked at photos of Sedona it's very likely that one of them was of these rocks. Headlined by twin spires and a large saddle in the middle offering spectacular views, the rocks are also surrounded in legend. One such legend is of a man and a woman who lived in the valley below, but because they were always bickering they were told by the Great Spirit that if they failed to reconcile, their hearts would become hardened and they'd turn to stone. They didn't heed the warning, and today their images are etched into two of the smaller spires, which look like a man and a woman with their backs to each other. Legends aside, the rocks are a beautiful place to hike. The saddle in the middle offers spectacular views across Sedona, and sitting on any one of the shelves gives a fantastic view of the creek below. It's the perfect place to watch a sunrise or sunset, with the rocks truly lighting up when the sun hits them. Seasoned hikers will find the trail relatively easy, but should be careful when they're further into the trek as scrambling up and down rocks will be necessary. They should also remember to bring a blanket or jacket if hiking in the winter or early spring as the temperature can very quickly drop. Equally, in the summer they should make sure to bring plenty of water, as it can be particularly hot in the lower portion of the trail where there isn't much shade. The Cathedral Rock trail is just under a mile long (or a 1.5 mile round trip) with an elevation of around 600 feet. Not an especially long trail, but it can be made longer if needed by starting on the Baldwin or Templeton trail, which both intersect with this one. Or, for views of the rock itself rather than views from it, it's an idea to head for the Red Rock Crossing just opposite. This gives some amazing views of the rock formation, and some particularly good photo opportunities will be found. Cathedral Rock is a great example of red rock formations in the area, and whether visitors wish to see the views from the rock itself or get some great photos of it from a distance, they definitely won't leave disappointed."

"Charming Old Mining Town of Jerome","Arizona","Charming Old Mining Town of Jerome, Arizona, Surrounded by the Wonders of the South West","Once a mining town, Jerome, Arizona has always had a history of cultural diversity. Immigrant workers in the mines included Irish, Chinese, Italians, Spaniards, Croatians and Mexicans.  The first claims on the rich mineral deposits, were made by Anglo-Americans in 1876. Native Americans, who were of course the first to inhabit the area, continue to form part of the population today, which is majority white. The town is situated 5,200-feet above sea-level atop Cleopatra Hill. Directly beneath the town, buried within the hill, a vast treasure trove of metals was discovered by the early settlers. Copper, gold and silver generated a vast wealth for the claim holders for decades. Jerome was the largest copper producing town in the state, turning out 3 million pounds of the metal per month. At its height, with a population of 15,000 people in the 1920's, it was the fourth largest population center in Arizona. In the 1930's Phelps Dodge took over the claims and, after it ceased operations in 1953, the town dwindled down to 50 people. In the 1960's however, it became a sort of haven for counter- culture artists, thus helping Jerome return to life. Since the 1960's residents began to promote the town as a tourist destination, first as a living Ghost Town'' and later as the historic monument and thriving small community of 450 people it has become. As the result of efforts by inhabitants to rejuvenate the town, Jerome, Arizona was named a historic landmark in 1976. Today dozens of small businesses are open, including antique stores and various art galleries. The handful of restaurants offers a variety of fare that ranges from gourmet organic foods to pizza. Nine hotels and bed and breakfasts service travelers becoming acquainted with the town and the surrounding area. Touring the town is best done at a leisurely pace, as nearly every building dates back 100 years and has some historic significance. The quiet beauty and small town charm makes for a healthy setting to raise a family. There are several schools in the area including a Montessori Charter School in Cottonwood, about 8-miles away. To the west, the Prescott National Forest awaits. To the northeast lies the Coconino National Forest. Both of these wilderness reserves are less than an hour away and are home to beautiful scenery, wildlife and extensive campgrounds. A day trip to the Grand Canyon is also easily managed from Jerome, Arizona in less than 2 hours each way. Tuizigoot National Monument in Clarkdale is as short drive to the northeast where the remnants of the disappeared Sinagua people can be found. Sedona and Prescott are larger towns, both about 27-miles away in opposite directions. Prescott, inhabited by more than 40,000 people, can provide the services not available in Jerome.

"Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona is a Mecca for Hikers","Arizona","Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona is a Mecca for Hikers","	Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona is an 18-square-mile park known for its unique geologic formations. Located at the intersection of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts, and the southern Rocky Mountains and northern Sierra Madre in Mexico, this region is considered one of the most ecologically diverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The national monument, which is made up of about 12,000 acres in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona, was designated as 	such in 1924, though it was owned by a private party, Neil and Emma Erickson, Swedish immigrants. It was sold to the National Park Service in 1979. The volcanic mountains that are part of this monument range in height from 5,100 to 7,800 feet. These spires and unusual rock formations were formed by volcanic eruptions that laid down thousands of feet of ash and pumice. The mixture fused and created such diverse formations as precariously balanced rocks and an area known as The Organ Pipes. Chiricahua National Monument is also known to be an excellent wildlife viewing area. Many unusual species of both animals and plants can be found there, including several that are on the rare or endangered species list. A small onsite Visitor Center offers an 8-minute video about the history of the park and its unique formations. Guests on a short visit can also take an 8-mile drive to Massai Point for excellent views of the rocks. About a dozen walks or hikes on designated trails range from easy strolls to strenuous treks. The Heart of Rocks Trail, which takes 5 to 8 hours to complete, takes hikers past the most unique formations - including Duck on a Rock, Punch & Judy, Kissing Rocks, and Big Balanced Rock - and provides the best views of the park's unusual terrain. Many of the trails begin at the Visitor Center and trail guides are available there. Rangers can help with trail directions as well. A few individual campsites are available within the Chiricahua National Monument, booked on a first come, first serve basis. Group sites are also available.

"Douglas Mansion","Arizona","Douglas Mansion - Jerome, AZ - Historic Mansion","The town of Jerome, AZ, sits above the surrounding area on Cleopatra Hill, at an altitude of about 5,400 feet. Once bustling with as many as 15,000 people, it now has only about 400 people - a virtual ghost town. At one time, Jerome was one of the largest cities in the state of Arizona. Its population consisted of mostly miners and businessmen connected with mining in some way. While some small mines were in the area around 1890, one company hoping to find copper had dug a mine shaft down 1,200 feet. Instead of copper, they found gold. The discovery of gold, along with earlier finds of copper and silver, made this area attractive to businessmen and others who were looking to make money. A little later, around 1912, James S. Douglas had purchased some land and then developed the Little Daisy mine. This mine produced many tons of copper each year for many years. James Douglas built his mansion in 1916, very close to the entrance of the Little Daisy mine. He made it large so that he could entertain guests and officials. The Adobe bricks he used to build the Douglas Mansion were made right there on the site. The mansion was built with the latest of conveniences at the time. It had a wine cellar, steam heat and a central vacuuming system. It also had a billiards room and a marble shower. On the second floor, he had a three dimensional model of the mine that showed all the underground tunnels and where they went under the town. After the closing of the mines in 1953, the Douglas Mansion was later declared to be a Museum in 1965. It is now the Museum of the ghost town of Jerome and it displays the history of the mines and of the town. Videos are shown all day about the history of the area. New videos are made every month. Many pictures, artifacts, and ore samples can also be seen in the museum. Many of the buildings of Jerome are original. Some of them have been restored and are being lived in now, or are being used as small stores and other shops. Some of the other buildings that are still standing are the United Verde Hospital, which is now the Jerome Grand Hotel, the Chief Surgeon's House, the Powder Box Church, The Gold King Mine, and more. After seeing the Douglas Mansion, there are also other sights nearby. For one thing, the scenic view from Jerome over the nearby valley is tremendous. Some say that you can see as far as 60 miles away on a clear day. Jerome has also become kind of a haven for artists, musicians and writers in recent years. Over 30 art studios can be found in town, and some offer lessons. The Tuzigoot Indian Ruins are nearby in Clarkdale, and Montezuma's Castle is there, too. Activities such as fishing, hiking, and mountain biking can be enjoyed in the area, and a couple of state parks are also close by.

"Fairbank","Arizona","Fairbank","Ghost towns are a popular destination in the Southwest and one of the most popular is Fairbank in Arizona.

Due to its proximity to Tombstone and the railroad, Fairbank served as a depository for goods and services headed west. It was a stage coach station and was home to about 100 residents. Many of the locals worked at the quartz mill, and the town also featured a butcher shop, a general store, a saloon, a restaurant, and a Wells Fargo office. After flooding in 1886 the Tombstone mines closed and Fairbanks began to decline. There were numerous droughts in the years that followed and after a flood in 1890, the town faced significant damage. Less than 100 years later, the town was practically deserted. Many of the buildings were deemed unsafe in the 1970's and all of the residents were gone within a few years. While many people assume that ghost towns were deserted long ago and have laid dormant until the last 50 or so years when people began visiting them as a novelty, Fairbank was actually operational up until more recently.

It makes for an excellent day hike and is located right at the bottom of the Catalina Mountains. The actual Finger Rock is a formation of rock that gives the appearance of a hand with a finger pointing upward.

The hike allows for spectacular, colorful views of the desert, as well as city views of Tucson and the surrounding area. The trail is fairly easy, but near the top requires more experienced climbing skills. If you are climbing all the way to the top, proceed very carefully in the final 300 to 500 feet. The view at the top is worth the harrowing last few feet though. When climbing, pay special attention around the area of flat clearing that is about 75% of the way up the mountain because it is easy to miss the cutoff that leads all the way to the top. The hike is easily reachable from most areas of Tucson and following an afternoon of hiking, there are plenty of places to grab a cold drink, a delicious meal, or a comfortable bed in the town of Tucson.

One trail is called the Bear Jaw, which climbs up to 8,700 feet. The climb reaches Peak A View where skiers can look out over the land and even see Flagstaff.

"Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah and Arizona Provides Scenic Vistas and Awesome Fun","Arizona","Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah and Arizona Provides Scenic Vistas and Awesome Fun","	Extending from Lees Ferry, Arizona to the Orange Cliffs of Utah, Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is an immense stretch of land that covers more than 1.2 million acres and hundreds of miles. This desert area, which is extremely hot in the summer and moderately cold in the winter, is both scenic and historic, providing amazing vistas, plenty of history, and lots of interest geologic areas. Once home to prehistoric Indian cultures that lived in the canyons, Glen Canyon has been the site of much exploration through the centuries and, throughout the 19th century, was home to hearty prospectors, miners, and ranchers who had to deal with extreme temperatures and little human companionship. The canyon area was also home to a number of Mormon (Latter Day Saints) settlements. The centerpiece of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area is beautiful Lake Powell. This man-made lake, which measures 186 square miles, began filling in following the completion of a dam across the Colorado River near the south end of Glen Canyon in 1963. It wasn't totally full until about 1980. However, in 1972, the National Park Service decided to incorporate the lake and its surrounding countryside into a national recreation area. It has since become a popular tourist area, attracting those who enjoy watersports and fascinating backcountry experiences. Lake Powell stretches from Page, Arizona to Hite, Utah but access to the lake by road is quite limited. Most of the water activities on the lake are concentrated at the western end near Page, including a marina, beaches, resort hotels, and campsites. Paved roads are also available at Bullfrog and Halls Crossing, where two marinas are located. Boating is the most popular outdoor activity at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. Visitors bring their own vessels or can rent one from local outfitters. Houseboating for an extended period of time is especially popular and an estimated two million people each year sail upon these crystal blue waters. Boaters or others who wish to fish should expect to find bass, crappie, walleye, bluegill, and catfish in Lake Powell.			Kayaking is also enjoyed here, including sea kayaking and the whitewater variety. Many of the side canyons offer prime low-keyed trips with great scenery while the water below the dam might provide a more vigorous rowing experience. For 4-Wheel-Drive aficionados, a chance to tackle the Burr Trail or the Hole-in-the-Rock Road will provide plenty of excitement and a little bit of danger. These off-road areas are best tackled by experienced 4WD drivers and can be especially treacherous in the rain and hot weather. Those who prefer to travel on foot can take advantage of several day hikes, ranging from easy to difficult, as well as multi-day backcountry treks. A few interpretive loops, like the Agua Tierra Trail, offer an opportunity to explore the flora of the area as well as local culture, along a paved route that's accessible to all visitors. For history buffs, a visit to Lees Ferry should be included on the itinerary. This area figured prominently in the settlement of northern Arizona and visitors can explore the old Lonely Dell Ranch located here. Guided houseboat tours of Lake Powell are available from local concessionaires as are flat water float trips. Guests may also tour the Glen Canyon Dam on a one-hour guided tour that travels into the interior of the dam and the generator rooms. This tour is free of charge.

"Gold King Mine Museum and Ghost Town","Arizona","Gold King Mine Museum and Ghost Town - Jerome, AZ - Ghost Town","The town of Haynes, Arizona, was once a suburb of Jerome. After finding some copper around 1890 on the hills in the area, a mining company decided to dig a deep mine shaft to dig it out. Oddly enough, copper was never found there. The miners dug down 1200 feet and never did find any copper - just gold. Not being too disappointed, they quickly began digging for this very precious metal. This mine became known as the Gold King Mine. For many years, many tons of gold had come from this mine - and other metals from other mines nearby. Altogether, more than one billion dollars worth of metals came from these mines. After a while, around 1953, the gold ran out, and the town became an all too familiar site out west around that time - a ghost town. Tourists in the area can walk around the old ghost town of Jerome and see a number of things that were just as they were back then. Visitors can take walks through parts of mines around there, and see and watch some of the original mining equipment in operation. The actual Gold King Mine is not accessible to visitors. A lot of the old machinery, however, is still present. One sight that will amaze guests is the world's largest gas engines. One of these has been named Big Bertha, which has a 10,000 cubic inch gas engine. Many other pieces of old equipment used in mining in the area and in the various mining vehicles are also present in the museum. One of the most popular sights is the old saw mill that is in operation and visitors can watch the old equipment and see how it had to be done way back when. The owner, who just loves to get the rusting engines and machines working again, fixed up an old 1943 US submarine engine and uses it to power the old sawmill. An old 1901 style blacksmith shop is also there. The Museum is open every day where a lot of this machinery can be seen. There is also a gift shop. A number of animals are present and the young ones can pet them. Apart from the Gold King Mine Museum, there is also the ghost town of Jerome.

Some old time stores are open just as they once were, as well. Jerome was once one of the largest towns in Arizona. At the prime of the mining days of the mines, which was in the 1920's, there were as many as 15,000 people in Jerome. Today, there are only around 350. The town became a ghost town shortly after the last of the mines closed in 1953. When visiting the Gold King Mine Museum and Jerome, AZ, you can choose between several bed and breakfasts that are in the town, along with some restaurants.

The river was forced out of the gorge, passed by the dam and then back to the original destination by the lava. The result was a water fall that is an off color during certain months of the year. The Reservation of the Navajo Indians is home to the Grand Falls. There is no cost for admission to the area which has an overlook with picnic tables. Dogs should be on a leash to prevent disturbing the livestock and visitors are asked to keep the area clean. Visitors are asked to stay out of the riverbed since it can be rather dangerous. The uniqueness of the Little Colorado River's Grand Falls makes them an ideal place to visit. Anyone close to the Navajo Reservation should make it a point to stop and take in the scenery."

"Havasu Canyon","Arizona","Havasu Canyon - Supai, Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - Scenic canyon","The Havasu Canyon occupies a beautiful and remote corner of Grand Canyon National Park, and is an off-shoot of the Grand Canyon itself. It's the homeland of the Havasupai Indian Tribe, who still call it home today, and the main village of Supai provides the perfect base from which to explore the stunning canyon. Supai and the Havasu Canyon can only be reached by a steep 8-mile hike, as vehicles have to be left at Hualapai Hilltop. The hike is considerably less strenuous than both the Bright Angel and South Kaibab trails, however visitors should still be prepared with all the hiking essentials. The hike down offers some spectacular views of the canyon and there are plenty of opportunities for picnics along the way. Once at the end and in Supai it's only a matter of time before the waterfalls start calling; with such beautiful scenery it will be hard to resist. For those who want to stay the night in comfort there's the Havasupai Lodge, or there are a number of other overnight options with the area being extremely popular with campers. Supai is home to several hundred tribe members and is a sight to behold in itself, showing visitors what life is really like on a Native American Reserve. Indeed, the village is the only one in the whole country that has its mail delivered by mule train, with villagers taking the 8-mile hike up to the ridge on a daily basis to collect mail and supplies. However, the flood of August 2008 has meant that the canyon we see today is vastly different to what it was before. Heavy rainfall, up to 6 inches in some parts, caused the creek to swell and break its banks, resulting in the canyon being closed off to the public for some 10 months. It was only re-opened in June 2009, with many of the pools and waterfalls having vastly changed shape or not being there at all. Navajo Falls was completely destroyed by the flood, and Havasu Falls changed shape considerably. Mooney Falls is much less damaged and can still be enjoyed by visitors, although they may be disappointed to notice that many of the smaller pools have been swept away. The canyon was, and still is, extremely popular and attracted some 12,000 tourists year on year. Today the Canyon is still home to a number of waterfalls, with even a few newer and smaller ones having been created, and is sure to continue to attract visitors despite its recent changes. The new pools offer a perfect and unique place for swimming, and visitors can't fail to be amazed at the scenery that surrounds them. Despite its changed scenery, the Havasu Canyon is still a must-see for anyone heading to the Grand Canyon National Reserve. With stunning views, an exhilarating hike down and the chance to see a traditional and remote Tribal village, it's well worth the trip."

"Historic Colossal Cave Mountain Park in Vail, Arizona - Historic Cave, Ranch, Museums and More","Arizona","Historic Colossal Cave Mountain Park in Vail, Arizona - Historic Cave, Ranch, Museums and More","Located southeast of Tucson, Colossal Cave Mountain Park has been a natural attraction since 1923 when the first tours of its underground caverns were arranged. The network of passages had actually been used for centuries by prehistoric tribes before they were discovered'' in 1879. The park's main feature now is Colossal Cave, which appears on the National Register of Historic Places and was improved with flagstone walkways, handrails and electrical wiring in the mid-1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Colossal Cave is dry'' or dormant,'' meaning a lack of water has halted the growth of formations inside, including a fascinating array of stalagmites, stalactites, helictites, flowstone, and boxwork. The basic tour through its depths of up to six stories takes a little less than an hour to complete, accompanied by a trained guide who relates the cave's history, legends, and geology. Basic tours take place daily throughout the year and not pre-scheduled. Waiting time is typically no more than 30 minutes after purchasing a ticket. No special clothing is required in the cave, which is constantly 70 degrees and dry. Both flash photography and videotaping are permitted inside the cave. Other tours take small groups of visitors through parts of the cave that were closed to the public until the 1950s. These include the Ladder Tour requiring hard hats and lights, the Wild Cave Tour through a quarter mile of unlit, unmarked, and rarely seen passageways, and the Candlelight Tour to experience the Cave in its original beauty. Another big attraction at the park is its working ranch, the La Posta Quemada. It has been around since the mid-1870s, and today features riding stables and areas for group picnics and cookouts. Western trail rides are organized daily from the ranch, starting from the site of the historic Mountain Springs Hotel and Stage Station and following the old National Mail Stagecoach route through the unspoiled Sonora Desert. Hayrides and stagecoach rides can also be arranged by reservation. The Ranch Headquarters House is home to a museum built by John S. Sullivan in 1967 to replace the original adobe structure that was lost in a fire. One room of the museum focuses on the human history of the area, starting with the Hohokam Indians who populated the region in the 10th century, while a second room takes up the history of the local environment. A second museum located on the ranch is the Civilian Conservation Corps Museum, opened in 2004. Set up like the Camp Commandant's office and open to the public every day of the year, it documents the work of the Corps. There is actual furniture built by the workers, a collection of historic photographs of the camp, copies of the camp newsletter, and a 1937 radio interview with Robert Fechner, the CCC's National Director. Additional sites to be seen at Colossal Cave Mountain Park include The Cowboy,'' a life-size sculpture by Buck McCain dedicated in 1997, the huge horizontal Analemmatic Sundial, and the Sluice, where children and adults can pan for gold the same way prospectors once did. Other points of interest are the park's Butterfly Garden and Desert Tortoise Exhibit, along with its Library and Archives. A caf, and a gift shop are also located on site. Overnight camping is permitted in the park, although the sites are primitive without electrical or water hook-ups. Fees are charged for admission, starting at $3~$5 per automobile or $1 per person. Cave tours cost $11 for adults and $6 for children aged 5~12. One-hour trail rides cost $27 per person. Dinner tours, school tours, and birthday parties may also be arranged. Colossal Cave Mountain Park is located at 16721 E. Old Spanish Trail, Vail, AZ 85641. From Tucson, it can be reached via 22nd Street east to scenic Old Spanish Trail, then south about 17 miles.

Settlements were expanded into northern Arizona by Utah pioneers during the 1870's but there were almost six hundred miles of canyons standing in their way on the Colorado River. Glen Canyon was the only place to cross wagons. There was a ferry established during 1873 since the area made it easy to get from Utah to Arizona. Lees Ferry named for John D. Lee the first operator of the ferry was important to everyone. Cars started crossing the river with the ferry during the 1920's. Marble Canyon was chosen as a place to build the Historic Navajo Bridge when it was decided a safer way to cross the river was required. June of 1927 is when the construction on the bridge began. It was difficult to get materials to the area and the ferry was used to assist. The Lees Ferry sank in 1928 and was not replaced because the bridge was so close to being completed."

"Hohokam Pima National Monument Arizona","Arizona","Hohokam Pima National Monument Arizona","Hohokam Pima National Monument is named after an ancient peoples called the Hohokam who are now the modern day Pima. The monument pays tribute to their ancient village and way of life by preserving the archeological remains of the area for future generations. The Hohokam Pima Village is composed of adobe structures and various artifacts that were created by a highly-skilled and brilliant group of ancient peoples. The monument is located on an Native American Reservation called the Gila River which is under tribal ownership. Unfortunately, the ancient village and priceless artifacts are not open to the general public and is an extremely sensitive area filled with history. Prior to the public closing of the village, excavations of the monument area were conducted in the 1930's and then again in the 1960's. The site was inhabited from 300 BC to 1200 AD and is believed to have been home to more than 2,000 people. Excavations of the Hohokam Pima National Monument are no longer allowed, they are restricted by tribal and government law. Archeologists have revealed that the Hohokam Pima people were a farming culture that lasted several centuries in the mesquite-studded desert lands. The culture was advanced and had one of the first irrigation systems in the United States. At the site of the villages, archeologists were able to discover canals that had been hand-dug and extended for miles through the Salt River and Gila River valleys. A large crop of corn, cotton, squash and other vegetation were said to have been watered by the complex irrigation systems. The Pima people were also expert weavers, sculptures, and builders.  The Hohokam were named after a Native American word which means that which has vanished. The former village of the Pima people was named after the Native American world skoaquik, which means place of the snakes. In 1972, the government authorized the village as Hohokam Pima National Monument to protect what is now commonly refereed to as Snaketown. Hohokam Pima National Monument is located on over 2500 acres of land and near a city called Sacaton in southern Arizona. The exact location of the monument is not revealed to the public in order to protect the wishes of the tribe and keep the sensitive area from being disturbed by possible explorers. The National Park Service reiterates that the national monument is not open to visitors under any conditions. There are other areas near the monument that tourists are welcome and encouraged to visit. One of the open facilities include the Gila River Indian Arts and Crafts Center. The center is both a museum an cultural center located north of Tucson, Arizona.

The rock formation is located in Papago Park which is a municipal park of both Phoenix and Tempe, Arizona. The rock formation includes a series of openings that eroded in the sandstone. Scientists speculate that the formation was created approximately six to fifteen million years ago. The area itself looks like petrified mud cakes and because of the unique structure draws visitors from all over the country to witness the uniqueness. The formation is a popular draw and attraction to the Papago Park. The formation can be climbed but is discouraged because of the danger for the inexperienced. The openings and the main chamber of the formation, near the top of the rock or summit, is easily accessible because the structure is very smooth. The chamber provides excellent views of the city and great photo opportunities. The wind blows constantly in this area so it is recommended that proper attire be worn if spending any time at the formation. Due to the wind continually blowing the sand against the structure, new formations are constantly in the works but it could take another million years before any changes are visibly noticed. "

"Homolovi Ruins State Park","Arizona","Homolovi Ruins State Park - Winslow, AZ - an Arizona State Park featuring the remains of ancient Hopi culture","The Hisat'sinom or Anasazi as archaeologists call them made their home on the Little Colorado River during the fourteenth century for a brief time before joining the people already on the mesas. These people are now known as the Hopi and continue to consider Homolovi to be their homeland. The Hopi still travel to the site to reconnect with the land telling us that the broken stones and pottery are part of the landscape creating the trail that will be followed by the Bahana when he comes back. Homolovi has changed a great deal over the years since the Hopi settled in another portion of the world. Eventually new people arrived at Homolovi and began to destroy what was there so the Hopi decided it was time to protect the land. Part of this effort was to support the Homolovi Ruins State Park which turned out to be turning the area into a park during 1983 and then opening the park during 1993. The Homolovi Ruins State Park which is at an elevation of almost 5,000 feet and over 4,000 acres big is now a center for researching the migration of the Hopi that occurred during the 1200's and 1300's.

"Lava Falls","Arizona","Lava Falls - Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - a waterfall like lava flow","Lava Falls located in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona was formed by the Uinkaret volcanic field. The field found on the Grand Canyon's north rim is made up of monogenetic volcanoes. The Colorado River has been damned by the lava flowing from the field down into the Canyon. The Grand Canyon was formed by land erosion and lava millions of years ago. The forces that shaped the canyon also changed the landscape around it. The forces that originally changed it are still changing it. The Uinkaret Volcanic Field is among the things that are continually changing the canyon. Lava Falls is above the Lava Falls Rapid. The rapid is the Grand Canyon's most severe. The shallow marine and coastal environments of the area saw thirteen thousand feet of lava and sediment deposited in them.

"Lava River Cave","Arizona","Lava River Cave, Flagstaff, Arizona","Nature creates some interesting and magnificent structures, as is the case with the Lava River Cave in Flagstaff, Arizona. The Lava River Cave is a mile long tube that was formed over 700,000 years ago. Molten rock that erupted from the Hart Prairie volcanic vent helped to shape the tube like structure. The top, sides, and bottom would solidify after the flow cooled. The rest of the lava river would then flow into the cave structure that can be toured today. Geologists have spent many years examining evidence for how the tube began. The rocks in the structure are like a map. The small wave like ripples on the walls show what happened. Today there are still some stone icicles that hang from the ceiling of the cave. These structures were formed when a final blast of volcanic heat caused the rock to re- liquefy and then drip. Temperatures even in the summer will be 42 degrees Fahrenheit inside the cave. Visitors are asked to wear appropriate clothing and sturdy shoes before taking the tour. The rocks can be sharp and slippery. There is no official tour of the cave. Instead it is open to any visitor who wishes to drive out there. It is suggested that all visitors have two to three sources of light when they take the trek. It is a very dark one mile hike into the cave. A few portions of the cave have in the past been defaced by graffiti. Luckily these areas have been cleaned up and many visitors take care to report any vandalism they have seen. The cave itself is located 14 miles to the north of Flagstaff. It usually takes 45 minutes for visitors to reach the cave. To access the cave visitors need to drive 9 miles north of Flagstaff on US 180. There is a left turn onto FR 245 that takes three miles to FR171 for another mile to FR 171B. It is a short distance from there to the Lava River Cave. Visitors can reach the cave year round. However, during the winter period it may be necessary to snowshoe or cross country ski to the cave. The cave will remain a constant temperature between 35 and 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Besides the cave and lava flow track the area has a beautiful scenic drive. It is also easy to view wildlife native to Arizona around the cave. Arizona does have snakes so individuals are warned to be cautious. Facilities are scarce around the cave. The Lava River Cave is considered a Natural Museum. This means that visitors can still learn about the history, geology, cave climates, and biology without being inside a city building. The entrance to the cave is a hole that leads to a lot of slippery boulders. The ceiling height will vary from 30 feet to some areas where it is higher. The coolest point is towards the beginning of the cave. At one point there is a low ceiling with a sharp curve in the passage."

Lee, owner and operator of the Lees Ferry. Lee was a Mormon and lived at the ranch with his numerous wives.

"Meteor Crater","Arizona","Meteor Crater - Winslow, AZ - a Meteor Crater that serves as a tourist attraction","The Meteor Crater can be found in Arizona 35 miles to the east of Flagstaff and 20 miles to the west of Winslow at the 233 exit of I-40. The visitor center at the crater is open from 7am until 7pm from Memorial Day to September 15th, from 8am until 1pm on Thanksgiving and from 8am until 5pm during the rest of the year. The Meteor Crater is closed on Christmas Day. Admission to the crater is $15 for adults, $14 for those sixty or over and $8 for those aged six to seventeen. 50,000 years ago a meteorite or meteorites hit Arizona leaving a large bowl shaped crater in Winslow, Arizona. The crater began with a depth of 700 feet and is now around 550 feet measuring more than 4,000 feet wide with a circumference of over two miles. While there is evidence to show the Native Americans referenced the crater it was not written about until 1871 by one of General Custer's scouts named Franklin. Years afterward it was called Franklin's Hole until settlers gave it the name of Coon Butte. When the crater was given the name of Coon Butte it was believed to be an extinct volcano that was part of the Hopi Buttes volcanic field. A sheepherder found iron-nickel meteorites in the area during 1886 and thought they were silver. It was not until 1891 that he reported the findings later other discoveries would result in the suggestion that the crater had been formed by a meteor. G.K. Gilbert the chief geologists for the United States Geological Survey briefly examined Meteor Crater and incorrectly determined that it was indeed a of volcanic origin this opinion would remain for twenty years. A mining engineer named Daniel Moreau Barringer developed an interest in the sites during 1902. He was determined to find the meteor that had formed it and began drilling in 1903 unfortunately almost three decades would be spent drilling discovering only fragments until the bottom turned to quick sand. In 1929 drilling of the crater was abandoned due to a lack of funding. The Barringer family leased the land around the meteor crater to Bar T Bar Ranch Company and in 1995 the company started Meteor Crater Enterprises Inc and the two parties signed a long term lease. The Meteor Crater facilities were built, staffed and maintained by the corporation. The Meteor Crater land is still owned by the Barringer family and with the help of the Enterprises the property is considered to be a public trust which contributes to education and science with special awards, grants and scholarships. The Meteor Crater has an Interactive Learning Center with several exhibits and interactive displays that make the center the most informative and extensive museum of its kind. A total of twenty-four exhibits make up the museum allowing visitors to discover the elements of color in the universe and unravel a mystery from Russia along with examining the Holsinger Meteorite. With all the Meteor Crater has to offer it is a place that those with even the slightest interest in meteorites and the effect that they have on the planet should visit."

"Montezuma Castle National Monument Arizona","Arizona","Montezuma Castle National Monument Arizona","The Montezuma Castle has a myriad of ancient dwellings that have excited tourists and explorers since it was first discovered. The ancient houses are located in the north portion of Arizona and is considered one of the state's best national monuments. The antique dwellings are built into the recesses of a limestone cliff that is situated seventy feet above ground. The ruins were named after the Aztecs that archeologists and anthropologists assumed lived in the ruins. Montezuma Castle was declared by President Theodore Roosevelt as being a place of great historic and cultural significance and he established the area as one of the nation's first monuments. Although archeologists initially thought the Aztecs had made the Montezuma Castle their home, it was later discovered that the Sinagua Indian people had actually used the land to meet both their housing and agricultural needs. One of the most interesting aspects of the Montezuma Castle National Monument is the Montezuma Well. There is no admission fee to see the well, and it is well maintained by underground springs. The well is a worthy stop that passes a picnic area and some of the ruins of a hohokam pit house. The well is located about eleven miles from the Montezuma Castle and does not take long to explore. The ancient peoples that once lived in the monument used the well and river access for fresh drinking water and the ability to water their crops. A thousand year old ditch for irrigation is located near the well and is still being used even today. The Montezuma Well provides a constant supply of warm, fresh water and is one of the last pieces of pure water that can be found in the nation. At one point, the National Park Service close the Montezuma Castle because the public was damaging the structure. In order to preserve the integrity of the structure the monument was shut down. Today, visitors are allowed to go into the monument but are not allowed to enter the ruin. Only park personnel are allowed to enter the Montezuma Castle but a virtual tour is available for visitors who want a clear look inside one of the most famous monuments in the United States. The National Park Service allowed the last tourists to journey through the Montezuma Castle more than fifty years ago. The earliest visitors to access the old castle did so by climbing up one of numerous ladders that were propped against the cliff dwellings. Visitors are charged a small fee of $5 per adult in order to enter the main site. Upon arrival to the site, visitors are encouraged to take precautionary measures that includes wearing appropriate shoes, clothing, and bringing water to accommodate the desert conditions. The climate at the monument gets less than 12 inches of rain per year and is extremely arid. It is estimated that 350,000 people come to the Montezuma Castle every year to learn the history of the monument. The Montezuma Castle National Monument teaches the public about the legacy of the Sinagua people, and how life was lived in ancient times."

The beautiful backdrop of the sky and clouds accompanied with the sun angling accents provides a colorful and scenic vision.   Before human existence, the Park was once a vast lowland basin. For hundreds of millions of years, materials that eroded from the early Rock Mountains deposited layer upon layer of sediments which cemented a slow and gentle uplift generated by ceaseless pressure from below the surface, elevating these horizontal strata quite uniformly one to three miles above sea level. What was once a basin became a plateau. The wearing down of the rock and landscape by wind and weather has created one of the greatest natural wonders today.

Originally, this was just a typical Arizona farm. The farming worked out well for the couple - so well, in fact, that Ray eventually built a small roadside canopy where he could sell their excess crop and make a little extra money. His venture was more successful than he'd ever imagined. By the early 90s, he'd opened more than 200 acres of the farm for u-pick business, and that was just a start. At the same time, Mark Schnepf, Thora and Ray's son, began to be concerned that their little town would be annexed by the larger town of Gilbert. To prevent that from happening, he and a group of friends began the process of incorporating Queen Creek into its own town. In 1989, the town was officially incorporated and Mark began adding attractions to keep families at the farm longer and provide entertainment for them while they were there. Starting with a small train, a carousel and a petting barn, Mark gradually started turning the farm into an agri-tourism business.

"Sentinel Peak","Arizona","Sentinel Peak - Tucson, AZ - Mountain ridge in Arizona","Sentinel Peak, often better known as A'' Mountain, is a mountain ridge in the Tucson Mountains. Standing at 2,897 feet high it offers great views of the Tucson valley, and is well worth the visit to see the infamous A'' that gets painted on the side of it every year. Sentinel Peak has a long history, and it was at its base that some of the earliest traces of human settlement in the area were found. It's made of various types of volcanic rock dating back some 20 to 30 million years, and for over 4,000 years the floodplains that surrounded it were used as agricultural fields. In the 1700's it was used as a lookout point for Spanish colonists, who posted a sentinel at its peak - thus the name. More recently the peak has the notoriety of being known as A'' Mountain, a moniker that's been used since 1915 when University of Arizona students created a large letter A'' on the side of it. The idea came when the football team defeated Pomona College, and they decided to create the A'' to show their victory. The idea soon took off and they've been re-painting it every year since. The letter is made out of basalt rock and measures in at around 70 ft wide and 160 ft tall. It was originally painted white, but since September 11th it's been painted red, white and blue - not only the school's colors, but also a mark of respect and patriotism. It sometimes gets painted green on St Patrick's Day, but hasn't yet returned to its original whitewash. Getting to the top of the peak involves a paved road climb, making it accessible for all without the need for any strenuous hiking. It's a particularly easy and enjoyable walk, just a 2.7 mile roundtrip. Many people choose to drive to the top to watch the sunset, and there are a number of barbeque grills available at the top to enjoy the views even more. The peak is part of Sentinel Peak Park, but there are no fees to visit either one of them. However, both the park and the peak itself are closed at 8pm most days and at 6pm on Sundays, so it's worth getting there early to enjoy the best views. Sentinel Peak, or A'' Mountain, offers some of the best panoramic views of the area. Visitors will be able to get 360? views from the very top, making it the perfect place to get some great photos. In such a great location and being so easily accessible means that it attracts visitors from all over, and tourists are sure to want to visit, if only to see the famous A'' for themselves. ntinel-peak.html"

"Skywalk Grand Canyon","Arizona","Skywalk Grand Canyon - Peach Springs, AZ - a walk in the sky overlooking the Grand Canyon","The Skywalk at the Grand Canyon is the only one of its kind. Four thousand feet over the Colorado River the cantilever bridge with a glass bottom opened on the 28th of March in 2007 and provides visitors with a bird's eye view of the Canyon. There have been almost a million visitors since it opened. The bridge goes seventy feet out from the rim of the Grand Canyon with a steel frame that is two inches thick and designed to be flexible in the wind, cold and heat. The skywalk's frame is anchored to the Grand Canyon with micro piles and casens that extend forty-six feet into the bedrock. The Hualapai Tribe built the skywalk to give visitors to the Grand Canyon a unique experience. More than a million pounds of steel were used to construct the skywalk which is taller than the Empire State Building. The bridge was designed to hold more than seventy-one million pounds and stand up to winds of one hundred miles an hour. When the bridge was constructed engineers figured the possibility of earthquakes in as well. It was designed to withstand an earthquake that is a maximum of 8.0 on the Richter scale within fifty miles of the Canyon itself. All forty-six panes that make up the walkway consist of five layers of laminated and bonded glass, each piece weights 1200 pounds to make it strong while still giving a view of the Grand Canyon. The Skywalk at the Grand Canyon is just a portion of Grand Canyon West which is a six thousand square foot development. Grand Canyon West includes a restaurant, visitors' center and gift shop as well. While the Skywalk offers a unique experience when it comes to viewing the Grand Canyon there were several arguments against it to begin with. Among them were that it is horrible looking and that it is turning a natural wonder into a commercial tourist attraction. Other arguments against the glass bridge were the lack of telephones, electrical service and water. The Hualapai Tribe manages the Skywalk Grand Canyon which is located on the tribal lands. There is a fee to enter the reservations and parts of it are off limits to the public. The costs for entering the Grand Canyon West is $29.95 a person with an addition costs of $29.95 for accessing the Skywalk. There are no personal items allowed on the Skywalk Grand Canyon due to the danger of dropping them and damaging the surface of the bridge. There are lockers available to leave personal items in and photos taken by a professional photographer which can be purchased at the visitors' center. The Skywalk at the Grand Canyon is open from 8a.m. until 6p.m. during the winter. Summer hours are from 7a.m. until 8p.m. and being on the first of May.

"Slide Rock State Park","Arizona","Slide Rock State Park - Sedona, AZ - Natural water recreation park","Slide Rock State Park is so-called because of its prime attraction, Slide Rock, a natural water slide and pool. The park is a popular attraction of Oak Street Canyon just 6 miles from Sedona and is a great place for sliding, swimming, or even just picnicking and enjoying the sunshine. In 1907 the park became Frank L Pendley's homestead, and he used it to develop a way of irrigating his apple orchards by harnessing the water from the creek. This history is still remembered today, with the annual Slide Rock Apple Fest drawing in tourists from all over to celebrate its past. Since the time of Frank the park has been used as a tourist attraction thanks to its crystal clear water flowing over smooth sandstone, creating the perfect natural water slide. The various chutes and pools are the perfect place to cool off in the desert heat, and it can often become particularly busy with everyone clamoring to slide the third-of-a-mile chute, only to do it all over again. It's recommended to wear old swimsuits as the rocks can be abrasive and could easily ruin good clothes, and equally it's advisable to wear old shoes for the trek back to the top of the slide again. Visitors should also take precautions as it can become especially slippery thanks to a thin layer of algae often covering the rocks, so caution is always advised. There are a number of short hiking trails in and around the park, and they offer a great way to experience the life of a traditional homestead with a number of old wooden buildings, farm equipment and the apple orchard still remaining. One such hike, the Slide Rock Route Trail, starts at the car park and takes hikers to the most popular stretch of water by walking through winding paths, down steps and over the creek. Other hikes take visitors up the cliff for some spectacular view of the creek, or if they park further away there's a particularly tranquil walk that takes them to the main sliding area. Admission to the park is $8 or $10 per car, depending on the season. However those who wish to park further away can do so for free, about half a mile away from the park where roadside parking is allowed, and will enjoy the 15 minute walk down to the creek bed. Slide Rock State Park is a great way to enjoy the summer sun while escaping from some of the heat, and is the perfect spot for swimming and sliding in beautiful natural surroundings.

"Sliding Jail","Arizona","Sliding Jail - Jerome, AZ - the jail that slid down a hill during blasting","Sliding Jail located in Jerome, Arizona wasn't actually intended to slide. The jail got its name from the general shifting and dynamite blast that caused the jail to slide an entire block past its intended destination. Jerome was a blasting town with a total of eight prostitution houses, twenty-one bars and thirteen hotels being blasted. The town had a dangerous combination of general shifting causing the town to slide or crack and blasts of dynamite. There are a number of businesses in the town today and the jail is still visible down the hill hundreds of feet from where it originally stood. The sliding jail was surprisingly still intact when it stopped moving. The town of Jerome was developed on Cleopatra Hill close to the local mining claims. A New York investor Eugene Murray Jerome owned the mineral rights and provided financing for the development so the town is named after him. Even though the town bears his name Mr. Jerome never visited the location. The areas rich mining history and the slight dislocation of the original buildings give Jerome an interesting air. A visit to the area isn't complete without seeing the sliding jail which is still fully in tact even after all these years."

"South Bass Trail","Arizona","South Bass Trail - Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - part of the trail created by William W. Bass","South Bass Trail found in Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park is part of a trail named for William W. Bass. Bass created the trail during the forty years that he lived on the canyon's rim. The trail is over fifty miles long and the majority of it can still be walked down today. The Bass Trail has a North Bass Trail as well. The South Bass Trail's bottom has a boat that was abandoned by Tadge and Russell during 1915. Bert Loper built the Ross Wheeler which was named for a friend that had been murdered. The remains of Loper where found twenty-six years after his 1949 death by heart attack on the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon Village is thirty miles to the northwest of the trailhead for the South Bass Trail. The main access from the Kaibab National Forest to the trail is by taking FR 328.

"South Kaibab Trail","Arizona","South Kaibab Trail - Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - Strenuous hiking trail into the canyon","The South Kaibab Trail is the second of two South Rim hiking trails into the Grand Canyon, the other being the Bright Angel Trail. South Kaibab is considered to be much more strenuous than Bright Angel because it's extremely steep, offering no water points and very little shade, however it's also said to be the more scenic of the two. The trail is just over 6 miles long and starts near Yaki Point on Yaki Point Road. At one time it was possible to park at the trailhead, however today parking is no longer allowed in an attempt to prevent overcrowding. Instead, hikers can get to the start of the trail by using the free shuttle bus that goes from the side road, or they can park slightly further away and walk to the overlook or the trailhead. The trail offers spectacular views with most of it following the top of the ridge. However, during the steep 4,820 ft descent there is little or no shade and the only water available is at the trailhead or at the river, so visitors should bring plenty of water and should be experienced desert hikers if they wish to travel the whole distance. There are, however, restrooms after 1.5 miles (and a descent of 940 ft) which offer the perfect stopping point for a half-day hike, which many people choose to do. The trail continues with a number of steep descents with restrooms and emergency phones further towards the end, and then at the edge of the Colorado River is the Phantom Ranch, offering a campsite and lodge facilities. However, visitors should be aware that these can get booked up a long time in advance, so those not wishing to hike back up the same day (nearly a 13 mile round trip taking approximately 7 hours) should be sure to make reservations. Hikers should always take precautions, particularly during the summer months when it can get incredibly hot. The National Parks Service even recommends that the full round-trip should never be attempted in one day, however many a seasoned hiker argues that it's perfectly possible to do so as long as one is fit, has plenty of water and knows what they're doing. The trail offers some of the most spectacular views of any in the canyon, and being so strenuous it's possible to avoid the crowds and enjoy it at your leisure. The trail itself doesn't require a fee, however entry to the Grand Canyon National Park does. Fees are $25 per private vehicle or $12 per person if on foot or by bike, and includes entrance to the North Rim as well as the South and all their trails for 7 days. With many visitors rating the South Kaibab Trail above all others, it's definitely a must-do for any trip to the Grand Canyon. Although it's particularly strenuous it can be enjoyed by less experienced hikers just as much as seasoned ones, and is well worth a visit no matter how far you go."

"Standin' on the Corner Park","Arizona","Standin' on the Corner Park - Winslow, AZ - a park dedicated to an Eagles song","Winslow was northern Arizona's largest town until the 1960's and was found on Route 66 giving the business ample business for the town to flourish. During the later 1970's Interstate 40 by passed the community and its prominence began to fade as tourists took the alternate route. For the next two decades the town stood still in time after the businesses found in downtown Winslow closed and the town saw no signs of regaining the traffic it once had until the Standin' on the Corner Foundation came along. The Standin' on the Corner Foundation that was once La Posada Foundation began renovating and reopened business with the assistance of private investors during 1994. The Foundation thought that a park would be beneficial to Winslow. The committee for the park decided that it would revolve around things that were in the song Take It Easy' and nothing that was not in the song would be in the park. The careful planning began once a piece of land was donated by the Kaufman family to place it on. Standin' on the Corner Park in Winslow, Arizona gets its name directly from the Eagle's song Take It Easy'' and the line standin' on a corner in Winslow Arizona'' and the verse that follows it. John Pugh painted a mural that covers two stories and Ron Adamson sculpted a life-size bronze statue of a dressed in 1970's attire propping a guitar on the toe of his boot. Donor bricks inscribed with a story about Winslow by those that have stood on the corner surround the statue and the mural. It took two years for the plans for the park construction to be completed by volunteers. When completed Standin' on the Corner Park had a two story mural that showed a girl in a flatbed ford reflected in the windows of a store. The mural also had an eagle painted on the window sill. The painting is surrounded by planters with their own built in seating, trees, lighting and native landscaping. The corner park is paved with inscribed bricks known as donor bricks. Donor bricks may be purchased then inscribed with whatever message that you would like then set into the surroundings. These donor bricks and other memorabilia from the park can be bought eight at the park or online to aid in the further development. These bricks allow you to become a part of the Historical site. The park opened to the public during September of 1999 and now brings additional traffic to the city allowing the businesses that have reopened to remain open. Tourists now visit Standin' on the Corner Park to have their pictures taken at the famous location. Along Interstate 40 between the New Mexico border and Flagstaff is Winslow, Arizona. The corner of Second Street and Kinsley Avenue is where the Standin' on the Corner Park is located.

"The Arboretum","Arizona","The Arboretum, Flagstaff, Arizona","Flagstaff is a maze of natural landscapes for visitors. Some of the natural areas have been turned into parks like the Arboretum. The Arboretum was once a year round home for Frances McAllister. The house was built in the 60's. McAllister wanted to build an arboretum so she donated her land to the project in 1981. She was very into gardening as a result of her early childhood in California. To preserve the natural gardens and create her own she wanted to make sure her land would be safe. At one time the 200 acres donated to the arboretum were a cattle ranch. Mrs. McAllister converted the original ranch house to administrative offices and built a home for herself. The horticulture center at the arboretum is a solar greenhouse with numerous botanical plants housed within. The Log House that was built in 1934 near Route 66 was once continually lived in. Now the home is a place for interns and retreat members to enjoy the arboretum. Numerous projects have been started on the land, and expansion will continue. As a research station, botanical garden, and education center the Arboretum is open to the public throughout the summer. Visitors can come to learn about the plant and plant communities.

"The Monument at Troon North Golf Club","Arizona","The Monument at Troon North Golf Club, Scottsdale, Arizona Consistently Found on Golfers' Must-Play Lists","Troon North Golf Club winds through the natural ravines and foothills of the high Sonoran Desert north of Scottsdale, and has long been considered a hallmark of desert golf. Both of Troon's courses - the Monument and the Pinnacle - have also long been on golf enthusiasts' must-play lists. Now, after extension renovations, the two courses provide golfers with an even more exceptional golf experience. The new-and-improved Monument course at Troon North Golf Club is the result of a two-year project by British Open Champion Tom Weiskopf to redesign both the Monument and Pinnacle golf courses. The transformation went beyond the typical golf-course renovation, as the entire 36-hole facility merged the two courses together and changed the sequence in which the holes are played. When the courses reopened in October of 2007, golfers were greeted with improved playability and two new layouts. Pennlinks Creeping Bentgrass was added to every putting surface, bunkers were reconfigured on both courses, and the distances between front and back nines and between greens and tees was shortened, making for a more walkable experience. The New'' Monument Course also features a 17th hole that was shortened by 20 yards, and changed from a par five to a challenging, brawny 495-yard par four. The result is a course that GOLF Magazine ranked #45 on its list of Top 100 Courses You Can Play for 2008-2009, featuring the best public-access courses across the country. Both courses are immaculately groomed, and offer a challenging golf experience, as well as the beautiful visual sensations and surroundings of the high Sonoran desert. In this locale, golfers may chance to see the source of the resort's logo - a petroglyph of a horned lizard. Petroglyphs were first etched onto large boulder by American Indians many hundreds of years ago. There's also a practice facility that features a full-length driving range with six target greens, ranging from 50 to 250 yards. A large practice putting green is located near the staging area at the clubhouse, and the green offers more than a dozen practice holes to prepare golfers for the challenge of the greens. There's also another practice chipping-pitching green near the driving range, and a separate, private practice area for private lessons and clinics located behind the driving range. In addition, Troon North features a state-of-the-art, air-conditioned Callaway Golf Performance Center.

Built in the late 1800s and beautifully restored with incredible accuracy, this Victorian home is now open to the public for all to see. The 2,800 square foot house was built in 1895 in an Eastlake architectural style, perfectly capturing the elegance of the era. It resides in downtown Phoenix's Heritage Square on its original foundations, and was the first house of its kind to be made out of wood and brick rather than the usual adobe bricks. The ten-roomed house was named after its original owners Dr Roland Lee Rosson and his wife, Flora Murry. Over the years the house has changed hands several times before finally being bought by the city and restored into the treasure we see today. The house now stands as a monument to days gone by, having been meticulously restored with intricate accuracy. One of its previous occupants, Whitelaw Reid, wrote many letters and correspondences during his time there that gave a great insight into the history of the house and led to the restoration team to be able to restore it in such detail. Today, tours are offered daily both for school groups and the general public to get an insight into life as it once was. Various exhibits lay just waiting to be explored, and the detail of the furnishings leaves many visitors feeling as if they've just stepped back in time. Everything is completely time-appropriate for the era, from the lace curtains and ceiling panels right down to the creaky wooden floors. Group tours of ten or more can be pre-booked up to 4 weeks in advance, with a maximum capacity of 13 visitors per 30-minute tour. Guided tours run on the half-hour during opening times between Wednesday and Sunday.

With the house being restored in such detail and with knowledgeable guides able to take visitors round, they're sure to leave having learnt something new. Being part of the Historic Heritage Square as well means that there's even more to see in the area, so being in such a great location means that there's no reason not to go."

"Tlaquepaque","Arizona","Tlaquepaque, Sedona, Arizona","The City of Sedona, Arizona was little more than a town to pass through in the seventies. Today all that has changed and the Tlaquepaque is one of the reasons why. The shopping and artists area was created to reflect old Mexico and the craftsmen that sold their wares there. The land was open range mostly when Abe Miller, a successful Nevada businessman starting vacationing in the area. He fell in love with a parcel of land owned by the Girard's. It was filled with a creek and beautiful sycamore trees. Abe Miller promised the Girard's he would retain the trees when he created what was to become Tlaquepaque. The trees have indeed been incorporated into the design of the venue. Calling Tlaquepaque a shopping mall is too common for the place is more than that. Local artists show their wares in their own stores. Many of the artists work on their pieces while the public watches. Tlaquepaque is filled with fountains, courtyards, and flowers. Tiles, ironworks, carved doors, lanterns, clay pots and benches came up from Mexico to achieve authenticity. The people that worked on the project were artists not contractors. There are many restaurants at Tlaquepaque. The most well known is the El Rincon. The other restaurants that are in the complex are the How Sweet It Is, Oak Creek Brewery and Grill, Rene at Tlaquepaque and the Secret Garden Cafe. Some of the restaurants feature live music and delightful art works. The bulk of the stores at Tlaquepaque are artists' galleries. They feature many mediums. Some create paintings and sculptures. Several more have hand weavings, glass, rugs and Native American works. Clothing stores have names like Calling All Angels, Diva Sedona, Hyde Out and Panara. Beautiful jewelry can be found at Cocopah, Geoffrey Roth, Gold Door Gallery, Ninibah and Red Canyon Collections. Many specialty shops exist in Tlaquepaque.

Others have furnishings, bed and bath products, pottery, handmade Christmas decorations, candles, music boxes, toys, wine and Off road Tours of Sedona. Weddings can be held in the Chapel at Tlaquepaque. The service is non denominational and can seat thirty people in the wooden pews.

"Tonto Trail","Arizona","Tonto Trail","Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park is where the Tonto Trail can be found on the South Rim. The trail starts at the Colorado River's south bank at the western end where the Garnet Canyon is and ends at the eastern end on the Red Canyon. The trail goes along Tonto Platform for most of its length of seventy miles.  The trail crosses a number of other trails through the Canyon such as the Bright Angel and Boucher trails.

"Toroweap Point","Arizona","Toroweap Point - Grand Canyon National Park, AZ - Stunning viewpoint into the canyon","Toroweap Point, in an area otherwise known as Tuweep, is a stunning 3,000 ft viewpoint offering fantastic views of the canyon and Colorado River below. Not for the faint hearted, the point is one of the most remote outcrops of the canyon and turns the legs of even the most fearless hikers to jelly. Toroweap is some 2.5 hours away from civilization, and even further if you attempt to drive in bad weather, and can only be accessed by a particularly primitive road - some may call it more of a dirt track - complete with twists, turns and sheet rock steps, meaning it's advisable to go at the wheel of a 4x4. But, once there, it offers some of the most breathtaking views in the entire canyon. Situated in the North Rim, Toroweap Point is actually the lowest viewpoint in the canyon, but even so it should not be attempted by anyone with a fear of heights. The 3,000 ft sheer cliff will make almost anyone queasy, especially if they dare to venture to the edge to look straight down into the vast and swirling river below. The road to Toroweap Point is open year-round, however it's advisable to call the rangers in advance to check that inclement weather hasn't made it impassable, which can be a particular problem when it's wet. The point itself rarely gets any snowfall, and can offer stunning views throughout the year no matter what the season. There aren't many amenities in the area with it being so remote, however there is a rangers station open year-round that can provide hiking information and backcountry permits, required for those who want to stay longer in the area but not needed for hiking. There are some particularly good hiking trails to and from the point, although again hikers should be warned that there are no water stops so they'll need to bring their own supplies. The Lava Falls Trail is particularly popular, despite being very strenuous. Hikers will need to watch out for sliding rock, scorpions and even snakes, but it takes them right to the water's edge where they can see some of the roughest rapids along the entire river. Make sure to watch out for Lava Falls itself, a 50 ft outcrop into the swirling river below. Toroweap Point is one of the most stunning and unique places in the entire Grand Canyon. It offers spectacular views and is in such a remote location that there's no chance of it being overcrowded, and provides the perfect place for a peaceful and stunning hike."

One of the more popular locations for tourists and residents to explore is West Forks. West Forks Oak Creek Trail is in the Coconino National Forest. Each season the forest grows lush with numerous different flowering plants and trees. Visitors are able to walk on level pathways through the forest along the trail towards a stream. The trail will take hikers past the steep canyon walls of Oak Creek Canyon. At certain times the hiking trail can grow narrow, but it will still be beautiful with the canyon walls that twist and turn along the stream. Landscape photographers will be able to find numerous locations to take photos. The forest consists of tall pines which grow at the base of the canyon. The trails and forest are home to numerous variety of wildlife like lizards, squirrels, birds, butterflies, and snakes. It is easy to spot some of these creatures while hikers are moving along the trail. It is best to take an early hike so that the temperatures are fairly tolerable. As the hike progresses in the day it can be quite hot. The hike will begin with the canyon walls along the path hundreds of feet above the hikers. Towards the middle of the hike there are stones and fallen logs to help the visitor continue on the trail without interference from the stream. The stream is usually only a few inches deep during the summer months. However, during wetter months like August the stream can hold small pools that are 3 feet deep. The pools will have trout and other small fish in their waters. To keep hikers abreast of where they are mile markers are posted along the trail. They are easy to follow. The scenery at the canyon can change with the seasons. Most often there are oranges and reds along the canyon trail, but in the summer months it can be a great deal more green. Hummingbirds stop round for nectar in the flowers, songbirds can be heard singing, and other local birds can be spotted. The West Forks Trail is just off Highway 89A. It winds down to the lower elevations towards Flagstaff. The entrance to the trail head is marked Call O' the Canyon.'' It is possible to use it as a day hike only. There is no camping on this trail. The trail requires $3 for the entrance fee. At the beginning of the trail is an old settlement area dating to the early 1900's. The trail is six miles in length and will require two to three hours to complete it. It is a round trip excursion. However, for hikers wishing a longer trek there is an 11 mile off shot to the Secret Mountain/ Red Rocks Wilderness. This makes an all day trip. On the 11 mile hiking area there are some steep points before getting back to the creek. The trail can be crowded during the summer months because of its popularity."

"Whiskey Row","Arizona","Whiskey Row - Prescott, AZ - Historic street of downtown Prescott","Whiskey Row is probably one of the oldest and most famous streets of Prescott, Arizona, with plenty of stories to tell from the days of the Old West. Whiskey Row, otherwise known as South Montezuma Street, dates back to around 1864, just after the city of Prescott was founded. At the time it was one of the most prominent and well-travelled areas in the city, with many famous figures often frequenting the saloons that lined the street. That was, after all, what gave Whiskey Row its name - the huge number of saloons, restaurants and other drinking establishments in the vicinity. Whiskey Row has had a long and colorful history since then, including the two fires of 1883 and again in 1900 which, between them, destroyed many of the buildings and businesses of the street. However, the street has been wonderfully restored to its former glory, with many of the buildings being renovated to look exactly as they did over 100 years ago. Today the street is still home to plenty of saloons and bars as well as many other establishments, and even some of the most famous buildings in the area. The Palace Restaurant and Saloon is one such place, being the oldest frontier saloon in the state of Arizona. The Palace has been open since 1877 and had to be completely rebuilt after the fire of 1900, but it was restored to look exactly as it did before with the original bar even being saved and re-installed in the new building. It still serves drinks and some of the best burgers in the area, and it's also a great place to go to see some of the history of the district with plenty of paintings, photos and other memorabilia lining the walls. The Hotel St. Michael is another well-known building, having been in continuous operation since 1891. Other places of note include Bird Cage Saloon, the Jersey Lilly and the Galloping Goose, all popular places with both locals and tourists alike. There are also plenty of old artisan-style stores throughout Whiskey Row, all offering a taste of the Old West. Then there are various street and musical performances both in the bars and elsewhere, really giving a feel of the whole area. Whiskey Row is just as popular today as it ever was, with plenty to see no matter what you're looking for. It's also a prominent place to visit on the 4th of July, when Frontier Days celebrations take place. One such even is the World's Oldest Rodeo, an event that's attended and watched by people from all over the state and beyond. Whiskey Row is a great place to visit for anyone who has a taste for the Old West, or even if you just want to step back in time for while and experience frontier life in one of the many saloons of the area. It's a popular tourist attraction and is a must-visit for anyone in Prescott or the surrounding area."

"Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park","Arizona","Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park - Yuma, AZ - Historic site of an Old West prison","Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park is located in Yuma, Arizona. Visitors can walk around it to see what life would have been like for prisoners in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and it stands today as a monument to prison life at the time. Yuma Territorial Prison was first opened on July 1, 1876. It operated for the next 33 years and was a model prison of its time, housing 3,069 prisoners before it finally closed its doors on September 15, 1909, due to overcrowding. After that the prison buildings were first of all used as a schoolhouse until 1914, before the cells were used to provide free lodgings and then for homeless families during the Depression. Since then the prison walls and many of the buildings have been eroded and destroyed, thanks to weathering, fires, railroad construction and the townspeople using the prison for free building materials. Only the cells, main gate and guard tower remain. Today, the 7 acre site is a state historical park and the remaining buildings stand as a living museum, showcasing what prison life would have been like for convicts of the Old West. Visitors are able to tour the prison and see the museum, and can see and hear stories of the convicts and learn about the history of the prison itself. It's a fascinating look back at history and offers a unique glimpse into the lives of those who were once imprisoned there. Also on the site is a Visitor Center offering all the facilities and information tourists could need, as well as picnic tables and a ramada so people can spend the entire day there. The Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park sits just above the Colorado River in Yuma, Arizona, in the heart of the Sonoran Desert. It's located just south of Interstate 18 at the Fourth Avenue exit so is easily accessible from anywhere in the area. The park is open daily throughout the year except Christmas Day, with the opening hours of the Visitor Center being 8am until 5pm. Entrance fees sometimes vary so it's worth checking with the park in advance. Visitors find the whole museum a great experience, and particularly enjoy reading the biographies of the prisoners as it offers a great insight into what their life would have been like there. Strolling around the prison ruins in the heat of the summer really gives people a chance to see that incarceration in such a place would have been less than pleasant, and it really makes people feel like they're experiencing it for themselves. A trip to the Yuma Territorial Prison State Historic Park is well worth the trip for anyone in the area, if only to see and feel what prison life was once like. The prison being open to the public is a great asset and really offers a glimpse into the history of the Old West and the prisoners that lived there."

The Bureau of Reclamation embargoed the line in 2005 and it stopped running. There are now three passenger cars and a locomotive parked to Yuma Quartermaster Depot's south and across from the canal.  The United States Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation originally owned the YVRY included in the flood control and irrigation project for the Colorado River levee. Yuma Valley Railroad began operating in 1914 until the 1980's; the original railroad went twenty-five miles to the Mexican border's San Luis from the city of Yuma. The nine miles that ran from Gadsden into San Luis were abandoned after it was leased to Southern Pacific Railroad during 1947. Today passengers can ride the Yuma Valley Railway for two hours along the same route originally taken. There is a narrated tour of the West Wetlands Park and a trip through local agricultural areas.
