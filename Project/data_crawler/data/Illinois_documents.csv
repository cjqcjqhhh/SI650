"Albany Park Neighborhood Part of Colorful Chicago History","Illinois","Albany Park Neighborhood Part of Colorful Chicago History","One of Chicago's 77 designated community areas'', Albany Park sits in the north central portion of the city and has been dubbed one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the United States. The area that is now Albany Park began with the purchase of 10 acres by entrepreneur Richard Rusk in 1868. Rusk opened a horse racing track there, which attracted city-dwellers to the area. They'd come to enjoy not only the sport but also the country-like setting they found near Rusk's property. The area continued to grow in popularity with city residents and was eventually annexed by the city in 1889, becoming part of Jefferson Township. In 1893, four wealthy and well-known Chicagoans purchased more than 600 acres near the Rusk tract and eventually brought transportation lines to the area. The four men, streetcar entrepreneur DeLancy Louderback, Illinois Trust and Savings Bank founder John Mitchell, Northwestern Elevated Railroad owner Clarence Buckingham, and transportation magnate Charles T. Yerkes, decided to call the area Albany Park, naming it in honor of Louderback's hometown of Albany, NY. The act of bringing public transportation to the area had a huge impact on Albany Park's commercial and residential growth. Streetcars came into the community around 1896 and the Ravenswood Elevated Train had reached Albany Park by 1907. In addition, streets were widened and straightened. This initiated a building boom that included not only numerous new homes but also large department stores, small shops, and entertainment venues, such as theaters. More than 7,000 people lived in Albany Park at the time of the 1910 census. Twenty years later, the community's population had increased more than seven-fold to 55,000. In the early years of the twentieth century, Albany Park became a haven for immigrants hoping to make a home and a living in the city. Germans and Swedes were the first to arrive, followed by large numbers of Russian Jews. Throughout World War II, Chicago's Albany Park was largely known as a Jewish neighborhood, home to numerous synagogues serving the population's religious needs. However, the years after World War II brought declining population to the area as many of the Jewish families moved to the suburbs. Throughout the 50s, 60s, and 70s, the community saw a marked decline in property values, and by the mid-70s, many homes and commercial locations stood empty and became dilapidated, attracting drug dealers and other unsavory characters to the area. Finally, in 1978, the city government along with the North River Commission and the Lawrence Avenue Development Corporation intervened in an attempt to revitalize the area. Thanks to its Facade Rebate Program, property values continued to increase throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Today, Albany Park has once again become a popular entry port for immigrants, this time from Asia and Latin America as well as the parts of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The neighborhood is often referred to as the Koreatown'' of Chicago; however, many shops and restaurants featuring a wide variety of other ethnic specialties have sprung up there, especially in the last decade. As a result of the large numbers of immigrants, the Chicago Public Schools estimates that approximately 40 languages are spoken in Albany Park's schools. The community of Albany Park is also well-known for its strong Democratic tendencies. Election results in the 2004 presidential election show nearly 98 percent of the voters in Albany Park precincts casting their vote for the Democratic candidate."

"Anderson Gardens in Rockford, Illinois","Illinois","Anderson Gardens in Rockford, Illinois","Mr. and Mrs. John Anderson received the inspiration for Anderson Japanese Gardens upon returning from their first visit to Japan in 1966. While visiting Japan, Mr. Anderson met a friend Akiro Ohno, who provided him with a complete look at Japanese culture and its people. When Mr. and Mrs. Anderson purchased property to build a new home, they both shared the idea that the grounds would be suitable for building their own Japanese Gardens. Anderson Japanese Garden construction began in 1978, and the grounds were designed and built by Hoichi Kurisu. Hoichi Kurisu first came to America in 1968, after accepting a Director of Landscaping Design at the Japanese Garden Complex in Portland, Oregon. Mr. Kurisu spent many years studying ornamental landscaping under the tutelage of famed Japanese landscape designer Mr. Kenzo Ogata, and opened his own landscape design and construction business in Portland, Oregon. The grounds consist of two extremely different areas; the first is a Japanese formal garden done in the style popular in 1185 through 1333 A.D., while the Tea House, Guest House and machiai are done in the 16th century Sukiya style. The three elements of the gardens are; rocks, water and plants. The first waterfall was built in 1981 and guided tours were first began in 1983. Over the next 20 years there were several improvements and additions made to the property. In 1986, the Guest House gardens were completed and the West Waterfall construction began. Between 1991 and 1997, the Anderson Center was purchased and remodeled and the Blue Iris Visitors Center was added. The gardens are designed to allow guests to commune with nature, enjoy peace and tranquility and leave behind the stresses of every day life. In April of 2008, the Anderson Gardens added a restaurant to the property, and is simply called the Restaurant at Anderson Gardens. The restaurant overlooks the gardens and has two outdoor decks for enjoyment during the spring and summer. There is seating for 135 people inside and the two additional decks allow for 40 more seats outside. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and has a weekend brunch option available for visitors.

"Andersonville Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Andersonville Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","With community roots extending back into the 19th century, Andersonville began when immigrant Swedish farmers started moving northward into what was originally a distant Chicago suburb. During the 1850's, the area north of Foster and east of Clark was a cherry orchard, and families had just begun moving into the outskirts of the city. The first school, Andersonville School, was constructed in 1854, at the corner of the two thoroughfares, and it served as the primary school in the community until 1908. After the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, wooden homes and buildings were outlawed in Chicago. The Swedish immigrants who could not afford to construct homes of stone or brick were forced to move to the city's north limits. The immigrants continued to arrive in Andersonville throughout the beginning of the 20th century, and settled into the newly constructed homes around Clark Street. Most of the community was dominated by Swedish businesses, from the delicatessens to hardware stores, shoe stores and blacksmiths and bakeries. Local churches such as Ebenezer Luther Church and St. Gregory's Roman Catholic Church were also built entirely by Swedish immigrants and reflected the religion of the new arrivals. Like many other European-American ethnic groups, the Swedish immigrants began to move to the suburbs during the Great Depression and post-war period, and the neighborhood began to experience decline. With growing concern about the deterioration of commercial situations, the Uptown Clark Street Business Association renewed its commitment to Swedish heritage by renaming itself as the Andersonville Chamber of Commerce. Andersonville was rededicated on October 17th, 1964, with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley and Illinois Governor Otto Kerner attending the ceremony. Around the same time, the annual Swedish summer celebration morphed into Midsommarfest,'' which has since become one of Chicago's most popular street festivities. During the late 1980's, the Andersonville neighborhood began to experience a period of revival as professionals rediscovered lovely homes and the close proximity to downtown Chicago made it all the more appealing. New stores, gift shops and restaurants opened and Clark Street had a new commercial vitality and diversity. Today, Andersonville contains the largest concentrated areas of Swedish culture in America and is home to a diverse community of residents and businesses. Andersonville is considered to be one of the hottest'' neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois and enjoys nationwide fame for its unique commercial district. The locally owned businesses are a crucial part of the vitality and life of the neighborhood, and provide untold economical benefits to the community. Communities all over the America now seek to emulate Andersonville as a model of a thriving and multicultural urban neighborhood. With its rich mixture of ethnicities and history, Andersonville has only grown in popularity over the years and continues to maintain its commitment to preserving its Swedish history and diverse community."

Briefly out of service, the airport was renovated and low-cost carriers began moving in to the airport. Midway is now known as the low-cost carrier home in Chicago. Southwest has a major presence at the airfield. AirTran is the second largest carrier there. 18 million people fly through annually, mainly on one of the two main carriers.

The committee approved a proposal submitted by international artist Anish Kapoor. According to plans submitted by Kapoor, the structure is expected to survive for 1,000 years. Cloud Gate is a sculpture designed by British artist Anish Kappor, located in AT & T Plaza of Millennium Park within the Loop Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois. Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture was unveiled during the summer of 2004. Because it has a legume-like shape, the sculpture has been nicknamed The Bean.'' The exterior of the structure is constructed of 168 highly polished stainless steel plates, stands 33 feet long, 66 feet by 42 feet and weighs 110 short tons. Costs of construction for the structure were first estimated to be around $6.1 million, however, by the time the park opened in 2004, the cost had increased to $11.5 million, and the final figure was $23 million. Cloud Gate was fully erected and opened to the public on July 15th, 2004, but was unfinished and unpolished because construction had fallen behind schedule. The structure was temporarily uncovered for the opening, but Kapoor was not happy because the public had seen the sculpture in an unfinished state. A 24-crew from Ironworkers Local 36 polished the seams between each plate in January, 2005, and construction of the sculpture was officially complete on August 28th, 2005. On May 15th, 2006 the sculpture was unveiled to the public for the first time and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley declared the day of the dedication to be Cloud Gate Day''. Kapoor was in attendance, and Obert Davis played Fanfare for Cloud Gate'', which he specially composed for the occasion. Cloud Gate is the piece of artwork by which Kapoor is most commonly identified. Cloud Gate has become world famous and was inspired by liquid mercury; the exterior reflects the skyline of Chicago. Visitors are welcome to walk around and underneath the arch of Cloud Gate, which is 12 feet high. Underneath the sculpture is the omphalos, a concave chamber which warps and multiplies reflections. Building upon many of Kapoor's themes, many visitors view the sculpture and think of it as a unique photo-taking opportunity. Twice a day, the lower 6 feet of the sculpture is wiped down by hand. The entire sculpture is completely cleaned twice a year with 40-gallons of liquid detergent and daily cleanings use a Windex-like cleaner, while the twice yearly cleanings are done using Tide detergent. Cloud Gate has become a tourist magnet and is now a common fixture on postcards, sweatshirts and posters. In 2004, Cloud Gate was instrumental in getting Millennium Park named one of the top ten architectural achievements by Time magazine."

"Cosley Zoo in Wheaton, Illinois","Illinois","Cosley Zoo in Wheaton, Illinois","On November 9, 1973, Paula Jones donated 2.65 acres of land to the Wheaton Park District. Ms. Jones wanted to protect the land from being developed, so she donated it in the memory of Mr. Harvey Cosley, a close relative and original owner of the land. With a great deal of help from local businesses and service organizations, the park district was able to repair the old barns, and the 1887 Chicago & Northwestern Train Station. Opened on August 17, 1974, the park was named the Cosley Children's Park and Museum. While the park only had a small handful of animals on opening day, within a few months the collection grew to include native wildlife as well. In 1976, the parks name was changed to the Cosley Animal Farm and Museum. In 1974, an 1800's barn from St. John's Lutheran Church in downtown Wheaton was moved to the park. Today, the barn is used for storage and displaying antique horse drawn vehicles. Railroad tracks were laid in front of the train station in the summer of 1975, and the following November, a retired Burlington railroad caboose was bought to sit on the tracks and serve as decoration. In September of 1976, money from the federal revenue sharing fund was responsible for the zoo being enlarged by 2 additional acres. A bird aviary was added to the zoo in 1982, and is home to 13 species of pheasants, ruffled grouse, doves and several other birds. The Wheaton Park District has raised money through fund raising through the years and made several more improvements to the zoo, including the addition of the Vern Kiebler Learning Center, a 66,000-gallon duck pond, an amphitheater and exhibits highlighting rabbits, white-tailed deer, raptors, raccoons, coyotes and red fox.  The Vern Kiebler Learning Center was constructed to house domestic farm animals and store food. The Learning Center also has a large indoor area for educational programs and special events. The facility grew and changed, as a result the name was again changed in 1999, to the Cosley Zoo. Cosley Zoo pursued and obtained accreditation by the Association for Zoos and Aquariums in March, 2002. Also in 2002, after a series of extensive talks between the zoo and the Forest Preserve District of Du Page County, the zoo became partners in the Blanding's Turtle Recovery Project. In the summer of 2002, the railroad ties surrounding the zoo were replaced with more attractive landing bricks thus lending the facility a more attractive appearance. At Cosley Zoo, visitors will see everything from a 2 lb. dwarf rabbit to goats, sheep, horses, chickens and ducks. Cosley also has a wide collection of native Illinois birds and mammals such as red fox, coyotes, deer, raccoons, hawks, owls, turkey vultures and much more.

"Eclectic Architecture and Abundant Shopping Make the Magnificent Mile in Chicago a Must See","Illinois","Eclectic Architecture and Abundant Shopping Make the Magnificent Mile in Chicago a Must See","The Magnificent Mile in Chicago has become one of the biggest shopping areas in the United States with all of the big brand-name stores; it is flocked to by 22 million visitors annually. The Mile'' runs from the northern strip of Michigan Avenue below Lake Shore Drive to the Chicago River to the south. The name of the Magnificent Mile is said to have been coined by Arthur Rubloff, real estate developer, when launching his plan for construction and revitalization of the area after World War II. However, many of the architectural sites date from the 1920's.  Between 1920 and 1929, a series of buildings were completed as part of the execution of the Paris on the Prairie plan, designed by Daniel Burnham in1909. Burnham, who received his big break as an architect after the 1871 Great Chicago Fire and the massive reconstruction effort that ensued, later established himself as the designer of the homes of the wealthy Chicagoans. Though the architectural tastes of Burnham have been questioned by many, by the time of his death in 1912, his architectural firm was the largest in the country. Three years before his death he wrote his proposed plan for the city in essay form, advocating for wide boulevards and fountains, advocating Greek inspired architecture and city support for development. Michigan Avenue was indeed widened into a broad boulevard and the Bascule Bridge, built to connect the Avenue with Pine Street on the opposite bank of the Chicago River, was modeled after the Parisian Ponte Alexandre III. The Ponte Alexandre III is widely considered to be the most opulent and beautiful bridge in Paris. The Chicago Bridge was adorned with nymph and cherub statues and old Europe-inspired, street lamps. The bridge was followed by other large buildings throughout the 1920's as mentioned above. The oldest structure is the gothic-style Old Water Tower which. made of limestone block, managed to survive the Great Fire, dating back to 1869. This landmark which is one of the oldest in the city has become symbolic of the Magnificent Mile in Chicago and of the city itself. In 1969 it was named the first Water Landmark by the American Water Works Association. From the 1970's onwards construction filled out what remained of open spaces on the skyline and this once residential area became the shopping hub that it is today, lined with skyscrapers of diverse architectural styles and periods. One of the last big skyscrapers, the park tower, contains a hotel on the first 30 floors and then upwards fills with 37-floors of residential housing. Single family homes as well as condos and townhouses can be found along the Magnificent Mile and on surrounding blocks.

"Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio in Oak Park, Illinois","Illinois","Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio in Oak Park, Illinois","Frank Lloyd Wright was an American architect who designed more than 1,000 projects during his lifetime. His primary focus was on organic architecture and this carried over in the numerous churches, homes, office buildings, schools, hotels and museums he designed. In 1991, Frank Lloyd Wright was named the greatest American architect of all time, by the American Institute of Architects. The Frank Lloyd Wright Museum and Studio is located in Oak Park, Illinois. The property and studio have been completely restored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust to resemble the way it appeared in 1909, the final year that Frank Lloyd Wright lived there. The house and property were built from money loaned to Wright by his employer, Louis Sullivan. The original structure was much smaller than the home is presently. In 1895, the home was extensively remodeled and the original kitchen was converted into a dining room, the nursery upstairs was turned into a day room for his wife, and a playroom for the children and new kitchen were added to the back of the house. A second renovation and addition in 1898, added the Studio and Connecting Corridor to the home. While in the Studio, Frank Lloyd Wright worked with his assistant Walter Burley Griffin and sculptor Richard Bock, to further the Prairie School of Architecture and together the three designed many noted structures. While here, the three men designed; the Gale House, Larkin Building, Robie House and Unity Temple. After 1909, the Studio and Corridor were converted into living space for his wife and six small children. For awhile the home and studio were turned into an apartment complex, however in 1974, the property was acquired by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. After this time, the property underwent a thirteen year restoration period and the Home and Studio were declared a Historical Landmark in 1976. Every year in the month of May, the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust hosts a housewalk , of the house and several more homes in the area that were designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Frank Lloyd Wright had a career in architecture that spanned some 70 years and designed in total 1,141 homes and prior to his death, 532 of those designs were completed and built. Before he died, Frank Lloyd Wright designed his two most famous projects, the Guggenheim Museum and the Marin County Civic Center. Frank Lloyd Wright had a direct impact on the face of modern architecture and his influence is felt all over the world, even today. Oak Park, Illinois has the largest collection of Frank Lloyd Wright homes and buildings, every month the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust sponsors many Wright'' events and these tours provide visitors with a glimpse into the mind of the greatest architect of the 20th century."
"Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago, Illinois","The first 40-acre tract of Garfield Park was opened to the public in August of 1874. Originally named Central Park, it was the centerpiece of the West Park System. Wiiliam LeBaron Jenney, designer Garfield Park, was influenced by French parks and boulevards while living and studying in Paris, his influence can be seen and felt in his designs of Westside parks. In 1881, the park was renamed in honor of slain United States President James A. Garfield. Jens Jensen, was hired as the superintendant of the West Park area, his most notable influence in Garfield Park can be seen in the formal flower garden south of Madison Street. Here Jensen combined Prairie-style elements and traditional formal elements. The original intentions for the park were for strolling and picnicking. However, Jensen's engineering expertise led to the development of a large lagoon which served as a means of draining the park site, while in the summer the lagoon was used for boating and in the winter time for ice skating. Recreational features of the park include baseball and soccer field, tennis courts, basket ball courts, a swimming pool, an ice skating rink and play areas for children. The Golden Dome highlights include an Olympic-sized gymnasium, fitness center, boxing ring, theater and gymnastic facility. Visitors can enjoy programs suited to people of all ages and includes picnicking, outdoor concerts and seasonal festivals. In the late 19th century, each of the Westfield Parks had its own conservatory and greenhouse. After being used for 20 years, the conservatories became outdated and obsolete. In 1905, Jens Jensen demolished 3 of the smaller greenhouses in Humboldt, Douglas and Garfield Parks to create a larger, publicly owned conservatory in Garfield Park. Construction began in 1906 and 1907, and the Garfield Park Conservatory was designed by Jensen in collaboration with the architectural firm of Schmidt, Garden and Martin and the New York engineering firm of Hitchings and Co. The structure represented a unique collaboration of architects, engineers, sculptors, artisans and landscape architects. Jensen wanted the Conservatory to be a series of natural-like landscapes under glass, which was an unheard of idea at the time. The strong shape of the structure was designed to resemble the haystacks of the Midwest, complete with the foliage and plants it houses. Today, Garfield Park Conservatory still follows the traditional tenets of Jens Jensen. One of the most popular rooms at the facility is the Palm Room. Here visitors can view 7 dozen different types of Palm trees from more than 2,700 varieties known to exist today. Of particular importance is the Double Coconut Palm, which was grown by conservatory employees in 1959. The tree is only found today off the coast of South Africa, in its native environment and produces the biggest seed of any type of plant in the world. The Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the largest and most impressive conservatories in America. The site consists of 4.5-acres and is devoted to displaying an impressive collection of plants from all over the world. Visitors are welcome to enjoy one of the largest collections of landscape art under glass'', and take advantage of the many wonderful things the park and conservatory have to offer."

"Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Grant Park in Chicago, Illinois","At the turn of the 19th century, the 319 acres that would be designated as Grant Park, was deeded to the commissioners of the Illinois and Michigan Canals. The city of Chicago officially designated the area as Lake Park'', on April 29th, 1844. For awhile the area went undeveloped, until 1896, when city began extending the park area over the landfill and lagoon. The Chicago South Park Commission took responsibility for the park and development in 1896. On October 9th, 1901, the park was officially renamed Grant Park, after the United States President Ulysses S. Grant. Because of legal restrictions, there were many building constructed on the grounds of the park. The park was the original site of the baseball diamond where the now Chicago Cubs, used to play. Daniel Burham wanted to develop the land for business purposes; however the move was fought vehemently in lawsuits against the City of Chicago, by Aaron Montgomery Ward. Ward wanted the city to clean up and improve the park area; the one exception Ward made was to allow for the construction of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1892. The Chicago South Park Commission hired the Olmsted Brothers to develop a new design scheme to beautify and improve the park in 1903. The brother's design plans were published in 1907, and included a more formal look designed around French landscaping principals. Further modifications were made to the park and a railway system, landscaped gardens and paths were added. The park continued to expand in the area over landfills and early in the 20th century, the Chicago Tunnel Company did further excavations and the park was formally landscaped by Edward Bennett. In the 1910's and 1920's further landfill expansion allowed the park to become the site for the Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum of Natural History and Shedd Aquarium, both of which were linked together in 1998, by the Museum Campus. Over the years, the park has been the location for many civic and historical events. Visitors have included Pope John Paul the II, and the park was the location for the Chicago Bulls championship celebrations. In more recent years, the park has hosted several of the most prestigious festivals in the city such as; Taste of Chicago, the Chicago Blues Festival, the Chicago Jazz Festival, Venetian Nights and from 2005 through the present day and until the year 2011, Lollapalooza.

"Hancock Observatory and Tower in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Hancock Observatory and Tower in Chicago, Illinois","The John Hancock Tower and Observatory in Chicago, Illinois is a 100 foot tall skyscraper. The building was designed by Fazlur Khan, a structural engineer, working for Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, and Bruce Graham of Architect and Design Partners.  The structure is the third tallest building in Chicago and the fifth tallest in America. From the ground floor to the top of its antenna, the structure is 1,500 feet tall, inside there are offices, condominiums and restaurants. The architecture and design highlights of the structure are what make the building so unique. The building design by Khan was done to eliminate the need to use columns for support, which in turn freed up more space to be used on the interior of the building. The design of the building made minimal use of steel and as a result, saved an estimated $15 million. In addition, the building is designed to withstand winds of up to 132 miles-per-hour, and the outer skin of the building is composed of black aluminum and bronze colored window panes, which are glare resistant. The shape of the building is a wedge, which gives the impression of the structure being taller than it actually is. During the peak of the buildings construction over 2,000 people had worked on the project. The structure took three years, 46,000 tons of steel and five million man hours to complete. The four corners of the building weigh 100 tons apiece and the aluminum used on the building is enough to cover over twelve football fields in length. The John Hancock Observatory is located on the top floor of the John Hancock Tower. From here visitors are provided with the best views of the city. The building is one of only twenty-nine worldwide with membership to the World Federation of Great Towers. The open-air Skywalk is the only one of its kind in Chicago and the only viewing tower located in the heart of downtown Chicago. Visitors to the Skywalk can actually feel why Chicago is called the Windy City'', there is no glass, but instead the entire area is enclosed and protected by reinforced steel screens. Guests can look around the sites and use a narrated telescope which provides commentary in English, Spanish, Japanese and French. Walking through the observatory, there is a history wall which details all the major events tracing the history of the city.

The rare exhibit shows the early potential of the author that was to pen some of the greatest novels ever written, and many of Hemingway's writings are considered to be American classics. The famous letter from Agnes von Kurowsky is on display in the museum. Hemingway first met Agnes von Kurowsky at the Red Cross Hospital in Milan, Italy. The nurse took care of the Hemingway when he was wounded in World War I, and the couple soon fell in love and were engaged. The engagement was short lived however, when Hemingway moved back to the United Sates. Agnes wrote a letter in which she stated she was ending the engagement and marrying an Italian officer. Hemingway was left heartbroken and the relationship provided the inspiration for the novel, A Farewell to Arms''. A special exhibit in the museum highlights the love of the outdoors that the author had. Hemingway was taught by his father to fish, hunt and camp and being in the outdoors soon became one of Hemingway's most loved hobbies. Hemingway spent many summers of his younger years at Walloon Lake. These experiences prompted Hemingway to travel abroad and live in remote places, and provided him with the inspiration needed to write novels set in distant locations. One of the exhibits tells about Hemingway and his affection for the arts. His mother was an aspiring opera singer at one time; she earned money by giving music and singing lessons in the family home. Hemingway's mother made sure that he was exposed to the arts, by taking him to operas and museums in Chicago quite frequently. Hemingway soon developed a deep appreciation for music and the arts, which was reflected in his writings. The Hemingway Museum also focuses on the informal education the author received when growing up in Oak Park, Illinois and the surrounding Chicago area. Hemingway was soon writing about the people, places and events he had witnessed as a teenager. The lasting effects of the events can be traced in earlier works by Hemingway.

The neighborhood is the home of the University of Chicago, Hyde Park Art Center, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Renaissance Society and the Oriental Institute. Hyde Park is the former name of a Township that included many other neighborhoods that had been annexed by the City of Chicago. Founded by Paul Cornell in the 1850's, Hyde Park is near the Illinois Central Railroad, located south of Chicago. The Hyde Park Township was formed in 1861, and extended from 39th to 63rd Streets. The south border of Hyde Park later extended as far as South 138th Street and west to State Street. The township was annexed to the City of Chicago in 1889, and up until that time had been independent of Chicago. During the 1920's, the University of Chicago lured the Chicago Theological Seminary to relocate to Hyde Park. Since that time, four other theological schools and the Divinity School of the seminary have joined the Hyde Park location, making it home to nearly 50% of Chicago's theological schools. In the 1930's, Hyde Park was a prosperous hotel and resort destination with more than 100 hotels, and a dozen elaborate structures located along the lakefront. During the 1940's, following the Great Depression and during the war, some of the hotels began catering to the transient population. Many of these hotels were later converted into apartment and condominium buildings. Because of a thriving artist community, the 57th Street Art Fair began in 1948, still continuing to the present day. Hyde Park has more than 30 playgrounds located in the neighborhood; all of them are located in within residential areas and are maintained by the Chicago Park District. The parks and playgrounds are designed for children of all ages when the park does not have a playground area, it does still have park benches and open fields. The even numbered streets in the Hyde Park neighborhood are almost all residential areas, while the odd numbers and particularly 51st, 53rd, 55th and 57th streets contain a large number of businesses. 53rd Street is Hyde Park's oldest shopping area and is lined with many wallet-friendly restaurants featuring take-out, and smaller businesses located between Woodlawn and Lake Park. A Farmer's Market, open air outdoor market is held on Harper Court during the summer months. Hyde Park is home to a number of places listed on the National Registry of Historical Places such as the Chicago Beach Hotel, the Arthur M. Compton House, the Isadore H. Heller House, the Shoreland Hotel, Charles Hitchcock Hall and many others.

"Irving Park","Illinois","Irving Park, Chicago, History and Community","  The Irving Park neighborhood in Chicago is actually made up of a group of many small neighborhoods such as the Triangle, Mayfair and West Walker which are located on the northwest side of the city. Known for its wide variety of historic architecture, abundance of dining and transportation options, Irving Park is popular with young professionals. White collar workers outnumber blue collar workers by 4 to 1.  The average age is close to 35 and there are more than twice as many non-family households as there are family households.  The median household net worth is over $98,000 . Irving Park is home to one of the most well-known Chicago landmarks, the Peoples Gas Irving Park Neighborhood Store. The building, erected in 1926 was one of several buildings that were built in order to promote the use of natural gas appliances. The building was declared a landmark in 1987 . Irving Park has a very active community. In addition to community assistance projects, such as the Irving Park Food Pantry, the home owners association is very involved in helping make the community a better place. Called The Old Irving Park Association, the group has several active committees and hosts several social functions each year. While Irving Park is now thriving, it has not been without its hard times. All but one of the original mansions, the Stephen A. Race Mansion, have been demolished. After the Great Chicago fire of 1871, many residents who had lost their homes rebuilt in Irving Park. Irving Park became part of the city of Chicago in 1889 at which time fire service, city water and other city services became available to residents. During the Great Depression, many buildings were converted into rooming houses. When the city decided to cut right through Irving Park to build an expressway, many lost their homes and several businesses closed. The revitalization of the neighborhood began in the 1980's and today the Irving Park Historical Society works to ensure that historic homes and other landmarks are preserved. The list of historic buildings is long, in fact there are hundreds of buildings that were built in the 19th century, but most do not have the type of historical status that prohibits them from being demolished, so each must be fought for on a case by case basis whenever a developer wants to tear one down . Today, an important goal surrounding Irving Park is to preserve its rich history and beautiful architecture for future generations to enjoy."

When Grant Park, which consists of nearly 320 acres, was being built in 1917, it was built around the land owned by the railroad . Once the railroad was no longer in use, the land sat vacant.

The facility is housed inside the former Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The museum was originally endowed by Sears, Roebuck and Company president, Julius Rosenwald, and first opened its doors to the public in 1933, during the Century of Progress Exposition. The Palace of Fine Arts was designed by Charles B. Atwood, and unlike other White City'' buildings, the structure was constructed using bricks under the fazade of plaster. After the World's Fair, the site initially housed the Columbian Museum, which eventually evolved into the Field Museum of Natural History. When the new Field Museum was opened near downtown Chicago, the museum organization relocated and the site was vacated. Sears, Roebuck and Company president Julius Rosenwald, and the Commercial Club of Chicago, pledged $3 million toward converting the old Palace of Fine Arts, into a new museum. During the conversion of the building, a new limestone fazade was added and helped the structure retain its 1893 art-beaux look, and the interior was redesigned using a more modern style, by Alfred P. Shaw. The new Museum of Science and Industry opened up to the public in three stages that took place between 1933 and 1940. The first opening ceremony took place during the Century of Progress Exposition in 1933, during the Century of Progress Exposition. The facility has several permanent exhibits on display. The Coal Mine is located inside the museums Central Pavilion and is designed to replicate a coal mine shaft.

"Navy Pier In Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Navy Pier In Chicago, Illinois","Navy Pier is a 3,000 foot long pier, and was a part of the plan of the City of Chicago, designed by city planner and architect Daniel Burnham and Associates. The pier was constructed in 1916 and cost an estimated $4.5 million to complete.  The structure was originally intended to be used for cargo facility purposes for lake freighters, and there were warehouses built up and down the pier. It was also designed to be a docking space for passenger steamers and due to the location was ideal for public gatherings because of the cooler temperatures in an era that did not have air conditioning. Even while the pier was being constructed, the introduction of cars and trucks was going to have a direct impact on the usability of the pier. The pier became much more popular as a public gathering place then it ever did at being used for the purpose for which it was designed. During World War II, the pier was used for Navy training, and at the time approximately 600,000 sailors and 15,000 pilots used the pier for training purposes. For this reason, the name was changed from Chicago Municipal Pier to Navy Pier. Once the war concluded, Navy Pier fell into the hands of the University of Illinois. During this time, the facility was used as a classroom for training returning veterans in a two-year undergraduate program. However, in 1965 the University of Chicago moved to the Chicago Circle campus, and the pier was no longer used. From the years of 1965 through 1989, the pier area was considered a public eyesore. Nobody and no agency in or around Chicago wanted to pour any funds into the structure. In 1976, the pier began to serve its third function, being used as a public gathering place. The east buildings were reopened as exhibit halls and special events and festivals began to draw people to the area once again. From 1979 through 1987, the US Submarine USS Silversides was docked at the pier. In 1989, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority took over the pier, and major renovations and construction began in the early 1990's. The pier was rebuilt at a cost of $200 million, and the pier contained kiosks, restaurants, a ballroom, shops, a concert stage, convention hall and a ballroom. Focal points of the restoration include a 150 ft. tall Ferris wheel, an IMAX Theater, the Chicago Children's Museum, Chicago Shakespeare Theater, the Smith Museum of Stained Glass Windows and a Bob Newhart statue which sits at the entrance to Navy Pier. If one structure could be chosen to best represent the history and culture of Chicago, it would be Navy Pier. The 79 year old lakefront landmark continues to experience growth and improvements, making it a work in progress. Every year there are more festivals and attractions added to the pier, which is the reason why an average of eight million people per year visit Navy Pier."

"O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois","O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, was constructed between 1942 and 1943, and was used as a manufacturing facility for Douglas C-54 aircraft during World War II. The location was chosen because of its close proximity to the city and local transportation. The factory was 2 million square feet and needed easy access to the city of Chicago, as well as the railroad infrastructure. Orchard Place was a small existing community in the vicinity and the airport was originally known as Orchard Place Airport/Douglas Field during the war. The location was the site of the Army Air Force's, 803 Special Depot, which housed many rare or experimental aircraft, including ones captured from the enemies. The historical aircraft would later be transferred to the National Air Museum, and then go on to form the core of the Smithsonian Museum's National Air and Space Collection. When the Douglas Aircraft Company contract ended in 1945, plans were proposed to build commercial aircraft at the factory. In the end however, the company chose to do the production on the west coast. With Douglas departing, the site took the name Orchard Field Airport, and in 1945, the location was chosen by the city, as the location for future aviation demands. The airport was renamed in 1949, after U.S. Lieutenant Commander Edward Butch'' O'Hare, a World War II flying ace who received the Congressional Medal of Honor. During the 1950's, Midway International Airport which had served as the primary airport of Chicago since 1931, had become too small and overcrowded for next generation jetliners. It was at this time the City of Chicago and the FAA began developing O'Hare to be used as the main airport of Chicago. In 1955, the first international flights at O'Hare took place, and an international terminal was added in 1958. The arrival of the air traffic from Midway made O'Hare International one of the busiest airports in the world, serving 10 million travelers annually. By 1960, the number doubled, with more people passing through O'Hare International Airport than had passed through Ellis Island in its entire existence. By 1997, more than 70 million passengers had passed through the airport and the number continues to rise each year. The airport is the largest hub for United Airlines and the second largest for American Airlines. O'Hare International had 972,246 aircraft operations and an average of 2,663 per day, in 2005. The airport is the second busiest in the entire world, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. O'Hare has a strong international presence and has flights to more than 60 foreign destinations and was voted the best airport in North America'', 10 years in a row by readers of Business Traveler Magazine and Globe Traveler Magazine. Today, O'Hare International Airport still serves as the primary airport for Chicago, Illinois and surrounding communities."

This holes snakes, turning right and then left, and features trees on both sides of the fairway off the tee. The hole plays uphill on the approach, and trees give way to rows of bunkers on the right near the green. No. 8 is a picturesque par-3 that plays to 196 yards from the back tees, but only 131 from the Whites. Even so, it has some unique features that may give golfers some trouble.

"Pullman Historic District in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","Pullman Historic District in Chicago, Illinois","On May 26th, 1880, on the open prairie, the model industrial town of Pullman, Illinois found its beginnings. The town was a tangible expression of an idea born in the mind of George M. Pullman, president of Pullman's Palace Car Company. The Pullman District was the first model of a planned industrial community in the United States and is designated on the National Register of Historic Places. Pullman decided to develop the community, to rival working class neighborhoods elsewhere. Pullman hoped to avoid strikes, attract more skilled workers and as a result attain greater productivity, health, environment and spirit among his employees. The 4,000-acre tract of land selected for the site was located along the west shore of Lake Calumet, approximately 13 miles south of Chicago. The site was essentially open prairie and marsh land linked to Chicago and the south states by the Illinois Central Railroad. Pullman hired Solon S. Berman to be the landscape architect and Nathan F. Barrett, and civil engineer Benzette Williams to translate the plans into a reality. Pullman's Palace Car Company employees were hired to construct the buildings and houses in the Pullman District. The structures of the town were composed of brick, made from clay from Lake Calumet and fired at a brickyard located to the south of town. Pullman stores produced the component parts used in the buildings of the town, and the project was the first of its kind using industrial technology and mass production on a large scale. The Pullman District had more than 1,000 homes and public buildings completed by 1884, less than four years after its inception. Each structure was provided with gas and water, access to sanitation facilities and had abundant sunlight and fresh air. Front and back yards had green space; expansive parks and open land were also featured in the neighborhood. Included in the maintenance of the homes were rental prices and daily trash pickup. Because of these factors, Pullman was voted the world's most perfect town at the Prague International Hygienic and Pharmaceutical Expo in 1896. The Pullman Historic District is a strong community with a devotion to heritage preservation. In 1975, the Pullman Historic Foundation was organized, with the intent of expanding preservation efforts already started and to involve greater resources from the surrounding community. The state of Illinois purchased the Hotel Florence and the Pullman Clock Factory Tower and administration buildings in 1991. With the acquisition of these structures, the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency began the development of the Pullman State Historical Site. Extensive preservation and renovations began taking place in 2000, and continues to the present day. The Pullman Historic District benefits from a rich and diverse residential community, with some of the residents coming to Pullman expressly for its historical value. Everyone who lives in the Pullman community appreciates the deep sense of history associated with the neighborhood and works hard to preserve its appeal."

"Soldier Field","Illinois","Soldier Field - Chicago, Illinois - Home to the NFL's Chicago Bears","Soldier Field, formerly Municipal Grant Park Stadium, is home to the NFL's Chicago Bears. The stadium itself is found in Chicago, Illinois, located close to downtown Chicago and the Museum Campus. As of 2008, it is considered to be the smallest stadium in the NFL. Renamed Soldier Field in 1925, the venue has been host to a variety of events, including the FIFA World Cup and countless concerts with stars such as Bon Jovi, the Grateful Dead, and U2. At one point, Soldier Field was home to the NASCAR Grand National, but this was a onetime only event held in 1956. It was also the site of the Chicago Freedom Movement in 1966, where Dr. Martin Luther King and many other people held a rally for equal rights. The design for Soldier Field was decided in 1919, when Holabird and Roche won an architectural competition to decide upon a structure to honor American soldiers killed in action. Construction began in 1922 with the venue's completion in 1924. It opened in October 1924 on the 53rd anniversary of the Great Chicago Fire. The first football game held at Soldier Field was between Louisville Male High School and Chicago Austin High School. Soldier Field was built by the South Park Commission. Soldier Field initially cost $10 million to build, but has undergone $600 million in renovations over the last 80+ years. The venue is owned by the Chicago Park District/City of Chicago and is maintained and operated by SMG. Interestingly enough, Soldier Field wasn't home to the Chicago Bears until 1971. With their move to the stadium, the natural grass field was changed to AstroTurf, but was returned to a natural surface again in 1988, and has been that way since. Initially, the open-roofed stadium had a seating capacity of 45,000. Over the years, this grew to its current capacity of 61,000. Still, the largest event held in the venue more than quadrupled this, with 260,000 people attending the 1954 Catholic Church's Marian Year Tribute. Many areas of the venue are available for rent for those looking to host a special event. Soldier Field also offers public as well as private tours for those looking to explore the historical site. Over the years, Soldier Field has undergone a number of changes. Now, patrons can find a number of Chase ATMs throughout the stadium. Soldier Field also offers almost twice as many restrooms as it did before the upgrade, and boasts 14 family restrooms on top of it. The architecture of Soldier Field is modeled after the Greco-Roman tradition with a number of columns. Of course, due to the expansion and need to keep the stadium modernized, these pillars are overshadowed by the size of the stands. The stadium also chooses to honor past football legends who played for the Chicago Bears with memorials all about the venue, commemorating the sports heroes. In 1984, the stadium was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Soldier Field was considered a National Historic Landmark until 2003, where its renovations modernized the venue beyond what could be considered to be a Historic Landmark."

The Arch was designed in 1947, by the Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen and engineer Hannskarl Bandel, to commemorate the Westward expansion of the United States. The Arch honors three events in American history; the Louisiana Purchase, the establishment of the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis and the Dred Scott case. The Dred Scott decision was one event that people felt culminated in the result of the Civil War, which was why the Arch posed such a heated debate. Construction of the Gateway Arch began on February 12th, 1963 and was completed on October 28th, 1965. Once completed, the Arch stands at 630 feet tall and 630 feet wide at the base, which makes it the tallest land monument in the United States. On July 14th, 1967, the doors to the Gateway Arch were opened to the public for the first time. The Arch is quite intimidating in structure with the base of the legs being equilateral triangles measuring at 56 feet per side and 17 feet at the top. Each wall is made of reinforced stainless steel covering reinforced concrete from the ground to 300 feet in the air, at which point the remaining 300 feet are constructed of rebar and carbon steel at the peak. The Gateway Arch is the tallest structure in St. Louis and the second tallest in the state of Missouri. Once guests have viewed the visitor and welcome center, they can enter the elevator system which takes them to the peak, to the observation deck. At the top of the Arch, guests exit the elevators and climb a slight grade to the observation deck, from here through small windows, they can view the Mississippi River and all the way to Cahokia Mounds, in Southern Illinois.  On a clear day, views from the top of the Arch can extend up to thirty miles. The elevators are egg shaped and the ride to the top takes approximately four minutes, while the trip down takes three minutes. Rides to the top of the Arch are offered daily and tickets can be purchased in advance or at the visitor center. In addition to riding to the top of the Arch, visitors can also enjoy the IMAX Theater, which shows a movie about the Lewis and Clark expedition and other events involving the Westward Expansion. Over the years, the Gateway Arch has stood as a landmark in the Midwest, welcoming visitors from all over the world to partake of its unique architecture and interesting history."
"The General at Eagle Ridge Resort and Spa","Illinois","The General at Eagle Ridge Resort and Spa, Galena, Illinois - The Crowning Achievement and Most Spectacular of the Resort's Golf Courses","The General Course, which debuted in 1997, is considered the crowning achievement and the most spectacular of the Eagle Ridge Resort's four golf courses. Designed by Roger Packard and two-time U.S. Open Champion Andy North, the 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,820 yards from the 4 star'' tees, with a USGA rating of 73.8 and a slope rating of 137. The grounds are said to be flawless,'' with Penlinks bent grass greens and fairways, Pencross bent grass tees, and bluegrass rough. The General Course sits atop the Galena Territory and terrain unique to the region. Ice age glaciers carved the land and left behind some steep hills, limestone cliffs and breathtaking views, and the General Course reflects those characteristics. The General Course has received a 4?-star rating as well as a 2002 ranking by GOLF Magazine as the #52 Best Public Course in the country. The course features twisting, rolling, undulating fairways defined by plenty of trees, tall fescue grasses and natural heather rough, some dramatic elevation changes, picturesque water hazards, and beautiful vistas. It's not uncommon to find tee boxes located on the sides of hills. One of the more noteworthy holes is the par-4 No. 9. Golfers begin with a nerve-testing tee shot and a forced carry over a deep valley of wildflowers to reach the fairway. Hole No. 10 is one of the more challenging par-4s on the course. At 396 yards, the hole feels much longer as it's all uphill, including a tee shot that crosses water to a fairway guarded by a deep, wooded ravine. Upon reaching the green, golfers will find it nestled amid trees at the top of a hill, so another accurate shot is required. Another noteworthy hole is the par-3 No. 11. This par-3 is all carry with virtually no room for error, as the hole plays downhill and tee shots must carry another valley of heather and wildflowers. Don't miss the green either, because it sits atop an elevated rise and slopes off in all directions. Hole No. 14 is another magnificent setting and a downhill hole with a drop of 180 feet. At 357 yards from the back tees, golfers will probably feel like they can drive the ball forever and reach the hole in one. Just don't miss the fairway, as it's lined by trees and the rough slopes off sharply to the right to more trees and water that may not be visible from the tee. The resort offers practice facilities, including a range located at the North Course, with seven target greens. The South Course features a pitching and bunker area with two greens, and all four courses offer practice putting greens. For instruction, the resort has a private Golf Academy with a new 10,000-square-foot chipping and putting green. The General Course has its own clubhouse, a 10,000-square-foot facility with locker rooms, golf shop, Spikes Bar & Grill and a premier Steak House restaurant for dining and relaxing. In addition to golf, the resort offers thousands of acres of rolling hills and a lake, all within easy driving distance of Chicago. The resort also features a spa and activities, such as horseback riding, hot-air ballooning, boating, fishing, and sleigh rides, cross-country skiing, sledding and ice skating in winter."
"The Glen Club","Illinois","The Glen Club, Glenview, Illinois - Rated the #1 Public Golf Course in Illinois by GOLF Magazine","The Glen Club can be found on a 195-acre refuge of tranquil lakes, rolling terrain, gently meandering streams and some beautiful vistas, including the Chicago skyline in the distance. The 18-hole, par-72 course is a Tom Fazio design located on the former site of the Glenview Naval Air Station on Chicago's North Shore. The Club opened in 2001 and immediately gained the distinction of being the only U.S. golf course to be named to all three Top 10 New Course lists published by Golf Digest, GOLF Magazine and Sports Illustrated. GOLF Magazine also rated it the #1 Public Course in Illinois in 2008. Because it was constructed over the former naval air station, Fazio essentially had a blank slate'' to work with, and moved 2.4 million cubic yards of earth and added 4,000 trees during construction. The result is a visually appealing design with a classic golf tradition, including rolling fairways and dramatic elevation changes. The course plays to 7,149 yards from the Gold tees, with a USGA rating of 74.8 and a slope rating of 140. It also features a number of highly acclaimed and noteworthy holes, including its par-3s, which Sports Illustrated proclaimed the best par-3s in the state.'' The No. 4 hole is one of those par 3s and is short but deceptive. Golfers will tee off downhill to a green surrounded by tall, native grasses and bunkers left and right. But what makes this hole so tricky is the wind. When it's blowing, par is considered a good score on this hole. Two more noteworthy par-3s are Nos. 11 and 17 - sister holes and two of the more challenging par-3s on the course. No. 11 is considered the most difficult par-3, typically playing into a prevailing wind. A water hazard runs the length of the hole on the left, and the left side of the green is also guarded by several bunkers and a slope that runs to the water. No. 17 looks remarkably similar, only the water hazard on the left is even more imposing to the eye as golfers get ready to tee off. The hole plays downhill and usually downwind, and the green is large but features distinct undulations in three areas. To have any hope of birdie, tee shots must find the right tier for the day's pin placement. The course also features a practice area and golf shop. But perhaps the most impressive facility is a majestic, 48,000-square-foot clubhouse with the unique distinction of offering overnight accommodations. The Glen Club also features a grand ballroom, as well as dining fare ranging from casual to upscale."

Barrows. The house was designed by William Dennison, the same architect who designed a home for Ulysses S. Grant. The home passed hands many times over the years, before it fell into the hands of the City of Galena in 1938. The Galena-JoDaviess Country Historical Society was formed the same year and signed a 99-year lease with the city to operate a museum on the property.  The Barrows House today is filled with over 6,000 square feet of exhibits and displays and 10,000 artifacts. Nine residents of Galena, Illinois went on to become Union Generals during the Civil War; the most famous resident is Ulysses S. Grant. The museum contains an entire display devoted to U.S. Grant and the Civil War. Features include original weaponry, letters, photographs and letters. The highlight of the exhibit is the Peace in Union'' oil painting, depicting General Robert E. Lee surrendering to Grant at Appomatox in 1865.

Grant and a crazy quilt made from pieces of scraps from the dresses worn by Mrs. Grant, while they resided in the White House. Lead and steamboats were the founding backbone of Galena, Illinois. While Native Americans had been mining lead for thousands of years, it was when the Europeans arrived that lead mining took off. The museum has an entire exhibit devoted to the history of lead mining and several artifacts and tools from the time period. More recently, the museum opened an original 1830's lead mine shaft, which is a tangible reminder of how mining was such an integral part of Galena's past.

"The Jefferson Park Neighborhood, Chicago Undergoes Resurgence","Illinois","The Jefferson Park Neighborhood, Chicago Undergoes Resurgence","The Jefferson Park Neighborhood in Chicago is located in the Northwest section of the city. The neighborhood is made up mostly of middle class working people. This has long been a section of the city that is populated by various city workers and police officers. The neighborhood is named, appropriately enough, after historic Jefferson Park which is located within the district. The seven acre park is used year round by residents of the neighborhood and entire city. There are two baseball fields, a football or soccer field, three tennis courts, a playground, a wading pool for children, and a full sized swimming pool with locker room facilities. There are also miles of walkways for joggers or residents just interested in a stroll through the park. The park also has a field house which is home to several clubs and classes. The teen club and senior center both hold meeting there as do music classes for learners of all ages. There are also several levels of tumbling and gymnastics teams that use the field house. The field house is truly the center of the Jefferson Park neighborhood. The park is named after the nation's third President; Thomas Jefferson. The park commission began acquiring land in 1920 and by 1929 the park was nearly done. The following year the field house was erected and the park still looks very similar to the original version despite the need for occasional updates. One of the most noticeable updates was the addition of three murals painted on the field house over the years. There is a painting of Columbus sighting land, a Viking ship, and of course a portrait of Thomas Jefferson. The homes that surround the park are sold for $500,000 and more; in some cases much more. There are a few million dollar homes sprinkling the neighborhood. This has caused the neighborhood to undergo a change from its working class roots. The neighborhood has stayed affordable to the working class mostly through the efforts of developers. Real estate developers have been buying homes in the neighborhood and tearing them down. After the larger home has been demolished two smaller homes were put on the lot that previously contained one house. According to the Jefferson Park Free Press zoning regulations need to be enforced, or changed to stop this practice because it is leading to overcrowding of the neighborhood. (http://www.jeffersonparkfreepress.com/) The Jefferson Park, neighborhood in Chicago offers the best of city of living combined with a sense of pride in the community and will remain a sought after section of the city to live in."

"The Lincoln Square Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","The Lincoln Square Neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois","The Lincoln Square neighborhood is located on the North side of Chicago, Illinois and was officially designated by its official name by the City of Chicago in 1925. Greater Lincoln Square covers the smaller neighborhoods of Ravenswood Manor, Ravenswood Gardens, Budlong Woods and Bowmanville. The houses in the neighborhood are a mix of small apartment buildings and private homes. The population in the area has historically been German influenced, though now there is a mix of Thai and Middle Eastern culture in the neighborhood as well. In its early days, people were drawn to the area because of its greenery and location away from the more densely populated neighborhoods of Chicago. When the first European settlers arrived in the 1800's, they made their settlements within the forests and prairies outside of the main city. The Chicago Fire of 1871 resulted in more people moving into the area to build wooden homes, because in the city, wood dwellings were prohibited because of fire codes.  As a result, those who could not afford to build homes of brick and stone, moved to areas on the outskirts of the city. In the late 1800's, realtors sensed the area was growing, at which time they bought up large parcels of land for minimal prices. The same realtors and investors then were the financial backers for bringing the L'' train into Ravenswood. The train became the most popular form of transportation and it is estimated some 10,000 people rode it on a daily basis. As a result of the train, people began moving into the city at a rapid rate and Lincoln Square experienced a population surge. As the area grew, Lincoln Square drew in record numbers of German immigrants. The neighborhood contains a large number of German businesses such as the Chicago Brauhaus, Merz Apothecary, Lutz International Cafy and Niedersachsen Club. The German influence can still be felt by the businesses, architecture and public art located throughout the neighborhood. In 1978, the City of Chicago began a series of renovations that transformed the area. Traffic was redirected, the old postal building was torn down and a new one was erected, the Chicago Transit Authority modernized and expanded the L'' and several parking lots were added. The most notable addition was the creation of Giddings Plaza, which was designed as a community space for local events. The city has more recently replaced the aging street fixtures and park furnishings and paved the streets and parking lots. Now even after many years, Lincoln Square is undergoing renewed interest and more people are moving into and visiting the area. Lincoln Square is known as a place that still offers the advantages it did several years ago, the neighborhood is quiet, peaceful and family friendly."

"The Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois","Illinois","The Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois","The Sears Tower is a skyscraper in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The building has been the tallest in North America since 1973, surpassing both the former World Trade Center and Empire State Building. The tower was commissioned by the Sears, Roebuck and Company, and was designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Khan of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. In 1969, Sears and Roebuck was the largest retailer in the world and had some 350,000 employees on the payroll. Company executives decided to consolidate their numerous employees that were distributed all over Chicago, into one structure on the edge of the Loop neighborhood. The space demands required three million square feet and additional room for growth and expansion in the future. The architects, developers and financiers came together and decided on an imposing 55,000 square foot structure and received approval from the Chicago Aviation Board. The entire construction of the tower was paid out of the pocket of the Sears Company and the final costs were estimated to be around $150 million. Construction of the tower began in August of 1970, with the building reaching its maximum height on May 3rd, 1973. Once it was completed, the structure had 108 stories according to traditional counting standards and according to owners it is 109 stories with the main roof, and 110 with the mechanical penthouse. From the ground to the top floor, the tower measures 1,450.58 feet. The building further increased in height in February of 1982, when two television antennas were added, making its total height 1,730 feet tall. The Sears Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in North America, the first being the CN Tower in Toronto, Canada.  The black bands that appear on the tower are actually louvers which allows for ventilation for service equipment and to hide the belt trusses, which Sears and Roebuck did not want to be visible, like the ones used on the John Hancock Center. The observation deck of the Sears Tower opened on June 22nd, 1974 and is on the 103rd floor of the tower. From this vantage point, visitors can view the plains of Illinois, across Lake Michigan, into Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin on a clear day. The deck is one of the most popular attractions in Chicago and draws some 1.3 million visitors every year. The top of the tower is the highest point in the state of Illinois and the antennas get struck by lightning on average of 650-675 times per year. The design of the tower was favored because the building can easily be expanded onto with extra height if needed. The Sears Tower Observatory is one of the most visited and highest observatories, and one cannot experience and appreciate the skyline of Chicago until it is viewed from this vantage point."

"The United Center Hosts Chicago Sports and Much More","Illinois","The United Center Hosts Chicago Sports and Much More","Chicago's enormous United Center was the brainchild of William Wirtz, owner of Chicago's NHL franchise Blackhawks, and Jerry Reinsdorf, majority owner and Team Chairman of the NBA Chicago Bulls. In the 1980s, the men sought a new arena for their teams, one that would replace the famous Chicago Stadium, known for its roar'' - an incessant noise that accompanied every event that took place there. The men proposed the idea in 1988 and construction on the new arena eventually began in 1992. It opened for business in 1994 and United Airlines purchased the naming rights until 2014 at a cost of $1.8 million per year. The owners of The United Center have proclaimed it to be the largest arena in the U.S. in physical size. (Other arenas, however, have a larger seating capacity.) This center for Chicago hockey and basketball covers approximately 960,000 square-feet and is situated on 46 acres in Chicago's Near West Side community. On the exterior, fans of the old arena say it bears a remarkable resemblance to Chicago Stadium and, acoustically, engineers even tried to recreate the infamous roar''. An electronic organ has replaced the old vintage pipe organ that graced the former arena, but it still plays during Blackhawks games, much to the delight of fans. Seating capacity at The United Center varies according to event. It seats 21,711 for basketball games, 20,500 for hockey, and as many as 23,500 for concerts and other events, depending on configuration of the stage. Numerous top-name entertainers have appeared onstage at United Center since its opening in 1994, including The Rolling Stones, Madonna, Bruce Springsteen, Beyonce, Brittney Spears, Celine Dion, Coldplay, and many others. In addition, the arena has played host to many collegiate sporting events including a number of NCAA tournaments. Family events such as circuses or ice skating shows have also made stops at the arena. United Center is sometimes referred to as The House that Jordan Built'' in reference to Bulls star Michael Jordan, who was a member of the team from 1984 to 1999. By far the Bulls most famous team member and often acclaimed as one of the world's best basketball players, Jordan is honored at the United Center with a statue located on the east side of the arena. It stands 17 feet tall from the base to the top of Jordan's head and was cast from 2,000 pounds of bronze. It was unveiled in November 1994 at the time his jersey was retired. The base reads: The best there ever was. The best there ever will be.''"

"TPC Deere Run","Illinois","TPC Deere Run, Silvis, Illinois - A PGA-Tour-Caliber Course in America's Heartland","When designing TPC Deere Run, course designer and PGA Tour player D. A. Weibring took a build it and they will come'' approach and theme. And not only golfers, but the PGA Tour came in response to what has been described as a majestic course. Now, TPC Deere Run golf course is known as the annual site of the PGA Tour John Deere Classic, which the course has hosted since opening in 2000. Even though the course is relatively new, designer Weibring gave TPC Deere Run an old-time'' feel. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to a lengthy 7,213 yards at its longest and runs along the Rock River. The river is visible on nine holes, and TPC Deere Run also features some dramatic pitches and rolls, some 70 bunkers of varying shapes and depths, gentle doglegs, a few blind shots, and several chipping areas, from which players can extract themselves from trouble. According to Weibring, It has all the things I think you'd like to have in a golf course. There are elevations changes, great views and scenery, hardwood trees. You have the Rock River complemented with small ponds, deep ravines...and there's no real estate.'' The course covers about 170 acres and makes use of the features of a former horse farm high above the Rock River Valley. The course is not considered a target-oriented'' layout, but does require imagination, shot-making and maneuverability. There are five sets of tees, and providing golfers with numerous options is a theme that runs throughout the layout. One of the more noteworthy holes is No. 4, a par-4 that plays to 450 yards and doglegs rights. Right off the tee, golfers must make a choice, as a large oak sits in the middle of the fairway. Another noteworthy hole is the par-4 No. 14, which plays to 358 yards but is drivable because it plays downhill. Coming up short, however, of the hole's elevated green will leave players with a blind shot from a tightly mowed chipping area. Going long can be even worse, as errant drives will clatter down a 60-foot bluff. What follows on holes 15-18 is considered one of the most enticing stretches of finishing holes in golf, with two long par-4s and a stadium'' feel and look common to many TPC designs. Hole No. 16 is particularly noteworthy. This par-3 plays to only 158 yards from the tips, but it requires a forced carry over scrub to a long, narrow green, flanked by a huge bunker on the front left and water on shots that hook or fly the hole. The course has received numerous accolades, including those from PGA Tour players. According to PGA Tour veteran Peter Jacobsen, I rate the course a 9 (out of 10) and that's worth telling people about.'' TPC Deere Run also offers a spacious practice facility, including a full-swing area highlighted by realistic target greens, and a short-game area for putting, chipping, pitching, and bunker shots. A choice of instructional options are also available, as well as a Golf Shop recognized as one of the Top 100 in America by Golf World Business Magazine 2007. For food and drinks, the TPC Grille features a full-service bar and casual food choices."

The course features Bent grass tee boxes and fairways, some dramatic elevation changes, and fast greens. The course plays to 7,030 yards from the black tees, with a USGA rating of 73.1 and a slope rating of 136. WeaverRidge is considered one of the most scenic courses in the state and features a number of noteworthy holes. On the front nine, hole No. 5 is considered one of the signature holes on the course. This relatively short par-4 plays to only 387 yards from the longest tees, but the hole doglegs around a large water hazard, forcing golfers to pick the right line. Hole No. 8 is a very scenic par-3 that plays downhill, ranging from 131 yards from the White tees to 194 yards from the Black. Many golfers may take this hole lightly as they take aim at an expansive green, but they should be forewarned, however, as this green often has a devilish pin placement near a cavernous bunker and sloping ridge to the left. What really sets WeaverRidge apart is the back nine, which Golf Digest has labeled one of the best nines in public golf.'' The fun starts immediately at No. 10, a par-4 that plays to 418 yards from the back tees. Golfers begin with a downhill tee shot to a generous fairway, but things get interesting as they approach, crossing over Big Hollow Creek to a tricky green. No. 12 is a lengthy par-3 that plays to 228 yards from the back tees. This hole has been described as simply incredible,'' and golfers with cameras in tow will be snapping off some shots from a teeing area 120 feet above the green. No. 17 is yet another signature and scenic hole, a par-3 that plays to 187 yards from the back tees. This hole plays slightly uphill to an elevated green, passing over a beautiful lake on the way to an undulating landing area with an extra-deep bunker guarding the front right side of the green. The course has received a number of honors and accolades, including being ranked as the 2nd Best Public Course in Illinois'' by Golf Digest in 2005, and being ranked #37 among America's 100 Greatest Public Courses, also by Golf Digest in the same year. It has also been award 4.5 stars in the Places to Play directory.

"With a Zoo, a Park, Clubs, Restaurants and Theater, You Have It All in Lincoln Park neighborhood, Chicago","Illinois","With a Zoo, a Park, Clubs, Restaurants and Theater, You Have It All in Lincoln Park neighborhood, Chicago","From fitness clubs to dance clubs to boat clubs - it can be found in the Lincoln Park, neighborhood, Chicago. Undoubtedly this area, located on the north side of town, is among Chicago's most happening night time areas with a wide variety of restaurants including international cuisine and international music. Lincoln Park neighborhood is also home to a gorgeous green park of the same name and the Lincoln Park Zoo, making it an area of the Windy City perfect for night life or family life. It is only 2.5-miles away from the main business district. Lincoln Park is seated on what was once a swamp, once home to scattered Native American settlements and a U.S. Army post established in 1824. It was not until after the City of Chicago was founded in 1837 that the population of the area began to establish itself. The park itself, sits to the east of the neighborhood, along Lake Michigan. It was built on land once occupied for a smallpox hospital and cemetery. Today, tennis courts, a rowing canal, a nature museum, an outdoor theater and a permanent series of activities and events fitting to any major city park can all be found there. The Lincoln Park Zoo has a wide variety of animals and is one of the only zoological parks in the United States that does not charge admission. Wandering the streets in the Lincoln Park, neighborhood, Chicago, both large boutiques and small specialty stores can both be found. And not only material needs but intellectual and artistic needs are also catered to here. Various theatrical venues as well as bookstores can be found as well as the DePaul University campus, home to 1,700 students. Families in Lincoln Park can choose to send their children to one of the various public magnet schools in the area, a private school, or the neighborhood public school. The tree-lined residential streets offer a pleasant stroll to take in the 19th century-style houses.  In some areas the homes are of more recent designs, the result of the reconstruction after the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871. Many of the homes built after the fire, were wooden structures that were replaced with sturdier, more permanent houses some fifty years later (in the 1920s). There is little doubt why this area is a favorite spot for Chicago residents and visitors alike. It has developed into an area of non-stop diverse activity for the inhabitants that wish to take advantage of it. Either by day or by night, Lincoln Park is a neighborhood of Chicago with lots of places to go and plenty of things to do."
