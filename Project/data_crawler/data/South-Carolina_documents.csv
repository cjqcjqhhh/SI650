"ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge","South-Carolina","ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge - Hollywood, SC - Wildlife Refuge with Hunting and Fishing","Created in 1990, ACE Basin National Wildlife Refuge was a joint effort involving private conservation groups, local landowners, federal government agencies, and state government agencies. This effort was designed to protect and preserve the ACE Basin area. The ACE'' in the Basin's name comes from combining the first letter of each of the following rivers: Ashepoo River, Combahee River, and Edisto River. The three rivers make up one of the East Coast's largest undeveloped estuaries. The ACE Basin includes roughly 350,000 acres, and the ACE Basin Wildlife Refuge is situated on approximately 11,815 acres within the Basin. Additional land is still being purchased to add onto the refuge area. It is anticipated that the ACE Basin Wildlife Refuge could grow to encompass 18,000 acres once all lands have been purchased and added. The refuge is actually made up of two units. One unit is located off of the Edisto River. The other unit is located off of the Combahee River. Some parts of the refuge are within the buffer area of the National Estuarine Research Reserve. The refuge's office is housed in a former plantation house. The plantation house was once part of a rice plantation and was built in 1828. There were only three antebellum mansions in the ACE Basin that survived the Civil War, and this is one of them. The building is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. The refuge is home to many different species. Painted buntings, turkeys, bald eagles, wood storks, white tailed deer, and alligators are just a few of the animals that live in the area. The bald eagles nest in both of the refuge's units. The wood storks, which are endangered, use the area during the summer. In the winter, ducks can be found in concentrations up to 30,000. Visitors are able to see a variety of different birds depending on when they visit the area. In addition, the refuge is made up of wetlands, tidal marsh, hardwoods, upland forest, and additional acres of shrubs and grass. Deer hunting is permitted at the refuge during scheduled times. The refuge hosts bow hunts, black powder hunts, and mobility-impaired hunts. Waterfowl hunting is also permitted, but it is only permitted in specific areas at specific times. Hunters should be in possession of a Refuge Hunt Permit. To inquire about permits or hunting, interested parties can call 843-889-3084. Fishing is also permitted in specific areas during the fishing season. In addition to hunting and fishing, the refuge features nature trails and visitors have many opportunities to photograph the wildlife. There is no charge for admission to the Refuge. Regular hours of operation are from dawn to dusk daily. The office is open from 7:30am to 4:00pm Monday through Friday. The office is closed on weekends and on federal holidays. The ACE Basin Wildlife Refuge receives about 25,000 visitors each year. For safety reasons, portions of the refuge may be closed during public hunting days. Additional information on the refuge can be obtained by calling 843-889-3084. Businesses in the surrounding area offer tours of the area, canoeing trips, kayaking opportunities, and campsites."
"Aiken-Rhett House","South-Carolina","Aiken-Rhett House - Charleston SC - Historic Townhouse and Museum","The Aiken-Rhett House is a spectacular townhouse dating back to the early 1800's, and has hardly changed since. Sitting in the most northern spot of Charleston's Museum Mile, it's one of the finest examples of historical Charleston and showcases its history like nothing else. The house was built in 1818 for Charleston merchant John Robinson before being bought and expanded by the Aiken family in the 1830's and `50's. William Aiken Jr. was a successful businessman, rice planter and politician, and being governor of Southern Carolina from 1844 he was also one of the wealthiest men in the state. He made the most of it, like much of the elite, by traveling to Europe with his wife, Harriet Lowndes Aiken, and returning with lavish fine art and furnishings. Luckily for the visitor, much of their purchases remain in the same rooms that they were bought for a century and a half ago. Named the Aiken-Rhett House because of the marriage of the daughter Henrietta to Major A.B Rhett, the house remained in the family until 1975 before being donated to The Charleston Museum. It was purchased by the Historic Charleston Foundation in 1995, and since then has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and has welcomed thousands of visitors year after year. The 3-floor townhouse is a spectacular example of what life was like for the upper classes of the 18- and 1900's. Visitors can enjoy original pieces as well as seeing the grandeur that the aristocracy of the time enjoyed - think ballrooms, dressing rooms and marble halls. Thankfully much has remained the same since the century it was built in, and any restorations have been undertaken meaningfully and sympathetically to retain as much of its character and history as possible. Think of it as preservation rather than restoration. Visitors will not be disappointed. You'll be able to see fine art, sculpture and furnishings, all museum-quality pieces, as well as the original servants' quarters, sheds, kitchens and stables, allowing visitors to get up close and personal with the past. Being largely unchanged since the late 1800's it's one of the finest townhouses available that showcases Charleston life of the time. Unlike other restored houses in the area, the lack of alterations and refurbishment means that visitors can really appreciate life as it was. There is also an adjoining courtyard that's used for a variety of events and programs that are run throughout the year. The museum is open Monday-Saturday 10am to 5pm, and on Sundays from 2-5pm. It offers the only audio tour in Charleston where visitors are self-guided using mp3's, allowing you to take your time and wander leisurely around the parts that interest you most. The last tour begins at 4:15 pm daily, and there are employees on hand to offer you extra facts and clarification if you need it. It costs $10 for entry, although if you wish to visit the nearby Nathaniel Russell House as well tickets are $16 for the two."

Meagher contributed his own personal collection of military artifacts and paraphernalia to start the museum.

The museum is primarily about the personal effects and uniforms that people in the military wore. There are some weapons displays but they are not the focus. The museum also contains hundreds of miniatures on display. Towards the end of the museum is a military chapel that displays how a military chaplain dressed. The American Military Museum relies solely on donated items so everything is authentic and accurate, not fabricated. Things that a soldier would carry on a daily basis are also available for viewing. From the Vietnam War, a booklet instructing soldiers on how to treat prisoners of war is on display. From World War I, a card designed to keep morale up that urges soldiers to keep smiling. Mess kits that soldiers carried through the years are also displayed. Many of the items on display at the American Military Museum are unique, one of a kind pieces. Some are so rare that they are thought to be the only of their kind in existence. The 1872 Buffalo Soldier uniform is one such item. An 1820 infantry hat is thought to be one of only three such hats in the world."

"Angel Oak","South-Carolina","Angel Oak - Johns Island, SC - 1,400 Year Old Live Oak","Angel Oak is a live oak tree that is located in Angel Oak Park, which is on Johns Island in Charleston South Carolina. Angel Oak is significant because it is believed to be close to 1,400 years old, which could make it one of the oldest living things located east of the Mississippi River. While there are some conservative estimates that date the tree younger, most consider the tree to be 1,400 year old or older. The limbs of the oak tree crawl along in ground and up into the sky. Spanish moss can be found hanging from the tree. Angel Oak is 65 feet tall and has a circumference of 25.5 feet. The largest limb of the tree is 89 feet long and has a circumference of 11.25 feet. Angel Oak is part of a species of trees that is native to the lowcountry area. The trees limbs stretch out in all directions, creating a wide canopy. The tree is located in a wooded area along Bohicket Road. In the 18th and 19th centuries, wood from live oak trees was valued for shipbuilding. Historical records trace the ownership of Angel Oak back to a land grant that was received by Abraham Waight in 1717. Waight owned several plantations in the 18th century. The tree stayed in the possession of the Waight family for four generations. Eventually, the land that contained Angel Oak was included in a marriage settlement. The marriage settlement was between Justus Angel and Martha Waight Angel. The live oak was named after this couple. Angel Oak is now owned by the City of Charleston, and there is no fee to see the tree. Angel Oak covers roughly 17,100 square feet. Most live oaks grow outward and do not really grow upward very much. Due to its age, Angel Oak has done both. Some of the oak's limbs rest on the ground. Some of the limbs even go underground and then rise back up out of the ground. Some of the acorns produced by Angel Oak have been used to produce authentic direct-offspring live oak trees. Angel Oak has survived earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. During Hurricane Hugo, Angel Oak was severely damaged, but the tree has recovered and continues to grow. Live oak trees have green foliage. In autumn, the leaves turn yellow. Live oak trees do not flower and like to have full sun exposure. They typically grow in normal soil, and their ideal soil moisture is simply average.

"Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge","South-Carolina","Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge - Charleston, SC - Cable Stay Bridge","The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is a cable stayed bridge over the Cooper River running from Charleston to Mount Pleasant in South Carolina. After beginning construction in 2001 it opened in July of 2005 to replace two outdated and deteriorating truss bridges, the Grace and Pearman Bridges, on US Highway 17. From Charleston, Route 17 first crosses Town Creek onto Drum Island, where the actual bride begins on the northbound side. At 2.5 miles long, it is the longest cable stay bridge in the Western Hemisphere. Cable stay bridges uses cables attached to towers to support a roadway. Most of the longest cable stay bridges are in Asia, with the longest in China. There, the Sutong Bridge measures 3,570 feet, more than twice the length of the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in Charleston, South Carolina. This bridge ranks in the top thirty longest cable stay bridges in the world, with the Alex Fraser Bridge in Canada being the only other bridge in North America on the top thirty list. This has made it a popular destination for fans of both construction and engineering in the United States. The bridge's namesake, Arthur Ravenel Jr., became a South Carolina state senator under a promise to get the new bridge funded. The effort started in 1995 when the Grace bridge received a disastrously low safety rating. In the end, the total cost of building the new bridge, which has been featured on the television show Extreme Engineering, was near $700 million and came in under budget and ahead of schedule. The final design of the bridge, with the diamond towers, was chosen by public consensus. The diamond towers extend 575 feet above the road. Cables on the bridge can hold over 500 tons and there are 128 cables in total on the bridge. The strongest cables on the bridge are comprised of 90 separate seven-wire strands that are formed together. A poly-ethylene pipe surrounds the cables to provide protection from natural elements. The road its self is located at a height 200 feet above the average high tide line, allowing for swells and abnormalities. The bridge is eight lanes wide and features a side lane for walkers, runners and bicyclists. This path is over two miles long and extends from Patriots Point Road on the Mount Pleasant side to East Bay Street on the Charleston side. The slope of the path is between 1.8% and 5.6%. With an eye towards stability the bridge was designed by Parsons Brinckerhoff to withstand hurricanes, earthquakes and shipwrecks. The bridge can tolerate wind gusts up to 300 miles per hour, which is much stronger than the destructive winds of Category 4 Hurricane Hugo in 1989 when it struck coastal South Carolina with high winds of 160 miles per hour. This bridge is also thought to be capable of withstanding a 7.2 magnitude earthquake. One-acre rock islands surrounding the towers protect the bridge from shipwrecks. Every spring the Cooper River Bridge Run attracts runners for a 10K race. The race begins on the Mount Pleasant side of the bridge and ends at Marion Square in Charleston. A limit of 40,000 entrants is set for the annual race. It is a combined race for both walkers and runners, but there are separate races for kids up to age 13 that range in distance from 25 yards to 1 mile. For every day walkers, joggers and bikers there is a parking lot available for just such a use."

"Barefoot Resort & Golf Club, Love Course, North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - Ranked #1 Among the Top 50 Courses in Myrtle Beach by Golf Digest","South-Carolina","Barefoot Resort & Golf Club, Love Course, North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - Ranked #1 Among the Top 50 Courses in Myrtle Beach by Golf Digest","The Barefoot Resort & Golf Club in North Myrtle Beach is a golf paradise, with four courses designed by some of the most recognized names in golf: Greg Norman, Tom Fazio, Pete Dye, and Davis Love III. Of the four, it's the Love Course that has received some of the best reviews, with Golf Digest rating it the #1 course among the Top 50 Courses in golf-rich Myrtle Beach and its Grand Strand. Davis Love III is a native of Carolina and his course design reflects the tradition of Lowcountry character, incorporating the recreated ruins of an old plantation along several holes. The course is considered traditional in design, and features wide-open fairways and generous landing areas, which makes driver the club of choice and bombing it'' the way to go. There are, however, some trees located in the middle of fairways to give golfers pause and make for some decisions. There are a number of often-dramatic forced carries on the layout, and the doglegs keep coming at you on this course, making for a lot of risk/reward holes where players can take different paths to the green. It's there, around the green complexes - which are said to be similar to those found at Pinehurst #2 in terms of shape and contours - where things tend to get more difficult. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2000, plays to more than 7,047 yards from the longest (Platinum) tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 138 on GN-1 tees and fairways, Tif-sport Bermuda grass approach areas, and A-1 Bentgrass greens. The rough areas are 419 Bermuda grass and feature some very tall, club-snaring grasses that golfers will want to avoid at all costs. The signature hole at the Barefoot Love Course is No. 4. In keeping with the bomb it'' mentality of the layout, this is a reachable par-4 that plays to only 294 yards from the longest tees, and 265 yards from the Whites. The green is elevated and well-guarded by bunkers on the front, left and right, however, and wayward shots tend to be punished on this hole. Just beyond the green lie the replicated plantation ruins, which are a signature element of the course. Practice facilities at the Barefoot Resort include a short-game area, as well as a newly completed driving range that stays open as late as 11 p.m. The resort also features two clubhouses, including the 35,000-square-foot Resort Clubhouse, which is said to give guests a sense of presence'' and greatness.''

"Brookgreen Gardens in Pawleys Island, South Carolina","South-Carolina","Brookgreen Gardens in Pawleys Island, South Carolina","Brookgreen Gardens is a sculpture park and wildlife preserve that covers 10,000-acres in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. Originally, the area that is now Brookgreen Gardens was six separate rice plantations, with the actual gardens being called Brookgreen Plantation. The gardens were designed by architects Archer and Anna Hyatt Huffington of Connecticut, who purchased the old plantation and surrounding properties, which first opened to the public in 1932. Brookgreen Gardens is the first ever public sculpture in America, and has a collection of more than 1,200 works of art by 350 sculptors. The gardens of Brookgreen have long been regarded as one of the most extensive and beautiful in the nation. In 1978, Brookgreen Gardens became a National Historical Landmark and is accredited by the American Association of Museums. The founders of the museum built the sculpture collection around Anna Hyatt Huffington and her contemporaries. The collection extends back into the early 19th century and moves forward into the 21st century. The Brookgreen collections are also featured in the British Museum, the Smithsonian American History Museum, the National Sculpture Society and the American Numismatic Society. Brookgreen Gardens is also responsible for creating one of the largest and longest running series of medals in the U.S. First beginning in 1973, the medals focus on the natural or cultural history of Lowcountry, or the sculptor. Sculptures at the garden are chosen based on the following parameters; date, medium, technique and significance. Some of the famous artists showcased at the garden are George Grey Barnard, Glenna Goodacre, Paul Howard Manship, Carl Milles, Katharine Lane Weems and several others. The Gardens of Brookgreen are a jewel in the crown of South Carolina. The land is a diverse mixture of swampland, salt marsh, sandy ridges and fresh tidal swamps. An area of particular beauty is the Archer and Anna Hyatt Huntington Sculpture Garden, which Anna designed in the shape of a butterfly. When entering the Diana Garden, guests will get the full effect of magnificence spread out before them. The Live Oak Allee Garden is composed of 250 year old living oaks that were planted in the early 1700's, back when Brookfield was a thriving rice plantation. There is also a Dogwood Garden, a Garden Room for Children, a Carolina Terrace Garden, Palmetto Garden and an arboretum. Other areas of interest are a landscape of native plants, gigantic specimen trees, and a display of herbs and vegetables that were grown during the plantation period. The Lowcountry Zoo has been an important element for Brookgreen Gardens since its very inception. Lowcounty Zoo is the only zoological facility on the coast of North and South Carolina that is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. All of the animals at the zoo are either bred or raised in captivity or received from a rehabilitation facility. Another permanent exhibit at the zoo is the Otter Exhibit, which was gifted thanks to the generosity of the Friends of Brookgreen Gardens. The River Basin Retreat is 1,200 square feet in size and features an 8,000 gallon tank made from clear acrylic panels. Inside the tank are simulated replicas of river banks, and the best part of the exhibit is guests getting to witness the otters up close and have the chance to take some outstanding pictures as the otters as they frolic and play.

"Charles Towne Landing","South-Carolina","Charles Towne Landing - Charleston, SC - A Living History South Carolina Settlement","Charles Towne Landing is a park that replicates the first European settlement in the Carolinas. It is a State Historic Site run by Friends of Charles Towne Landing and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The park is located on the Ashley River, Highway 171 about three miles north of downtown Charleston. Open daily from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, the cost is $5 for adults, $3 for students, and free for children ages five and under. Charles Towne Landing is advertised as the birthplace of the Carolinas Colony, plantations and one of the first major ports in the New World. Charles Towne Landing is an interpretive site with an animal forest, living history and archaeological investigations. Costumed rangers are seen in a way of life that the 1670 settlers experienced, demonstrating crop gardens, a fort and the 17th century supply ship Adventure. The animal forest is home to native animals that settlers would have encountered in coastal Carolina upon settlement in 1670. Archaeology has revealed how Native Americans, European settlers and African slaves lived. Also on the premises are walking and biking trails, an African American cemetery, the Legare-Waring House and a visitor center. Albemarle Point is the part of the park that hosts the living history experience. Staff members are dressed in 17th century period costume and interact with each other and with visitors as though it were the 1670s, making candles and soap, etc. The crop garden adheres to the instructions Captain Joseph West received when he was put in charge of the colony and is a demonstration of the colony's subsistence techniques. The fort in the living history area includes a Palisade Wall of pointed logs and earth fortifications used for cannons pointed toward the river. The final addition to the living history part of the park is the Adventure, a reproduction of a trading vessel that was used to carry supplies from the Caribbean to the colonies in the 17th century. The Adventure has seen two incarnations as one was built in 1970 and a newer version built to replace it in 2008. The animal forest is intended to be a place for visitors to view animals in a natural habitat. These animals would have been seen by settlers in 1670 and are native to the South Carolina lowcountry, although some species have long since disappeared from the state. The animals are mostly birds and mammals. Birds include: black-crowned night and blue herons, great and snowy egrets, pelican, white ibis and wild turkey. Mammals include: black bear, deer, elk, bobcat, bison, mountain lions and river otters. Friends of Charles Towne Landing offers an adopt-an-animal program where donors contribute a certain amount of money to adopt'' one of the animal forest animals. Archaeologists are seen working on digs around Charles Towne Landing. They are available to answer questions for visitors. Archaeological digs have revealed Native American villages and ceremonial sites, earth fortifications from the Revolutionary War, plantations and vineyards. Information gained from archaeology has helped to recreate the living history part of the park to the most accurate standards. The park uses many volunteers for the archaeology program and offers internships during the summer for college students. The Legare-Waring House and its gardens are an example of post-colonial life in the mid-1800s. The house is not part of the living history section of Charles Towne Landing. Instead it has a modern functional purpose of hosting state, national and international officials. It has also become a popular location for weddings because the entire house and gardens can be rented out. In addition to the main attractions, Charles Towne Landing also offers musket and canon demonstrations, stories of court cases and their punishments and a hands-on demonstration of how land surveys were conducted. Visitors also have access to walk or bike through a marsh or garden that hosts camellias, azaleas, and hundreds year old oak trees. The African American cemetery spans from nineteenth century to twentieth century and is still being researched by park officials. Information on daily activities, restrooms, gift shop, vending machines and a museum are available at the visitor center."

"Charleston Tea Plantation","South-Carolina","Charleston Tea Plantation - Wadmalaw Island, SC - America's Only Tea Garden","The Charleston Tea Plantation is located on Wadmalaw Island in Charleston County, South Carolina. Wadmalaw Island is an island roughly ten miles in length and six miles in width. The Island is situated southwest of the Charleston Peninsula. It is located on Maybank Highway (SC 700). In the early 1960s, the Thomas J. Lipton Company purchased land on Wadmalaw Island and built a research facility dedicated to the growth of tea plants. The company was attempting to cultivate plants that were previously at the Pinehurst Tea Plantation in Summerville, South Carolina. At the time, the property on Wadmalaw Island was the only functional tea plantation in the country. The Lipton Company was dissatisfied with the results of the operation and sold the property in 1987 to Mack Fleming and Bill Hall. Fleming was formerly employed by the Lipton Company. The new property was named the Charleston Tea Plantation. Fleming had previously devised a mechanical harvester to aid in the selection of crops. He also holds a master's degree in horticulture. Hall is a third generation tea-taster who studied teas in London. Sarah Fleming McLester, Mack Fleming's daughter, was also employed by the new plantation. Fleming and Hall developed a tea they called American Classic. The tea is created from the Camelis Sinensis plant, which is a black tea leaf. The production of the tea differs from that of Oolong tea due to the time it is left in the oxidation bed. The process used to create the tea takes roughly 20 hours. This tea was named the official tea of the United States' White House. In May of 1995, Fleming and Hall were special guests during the South Carolina General Assembly Session. In 2003, the Plantation was sold to R. C. Bigelow, Inc. for $1.28 million. Bigelow restored and expanded the plantation. They also reopened the property to the public in January of 2006. Since Bigelow took over, the tea plants have produced more each harvest than the preceding year. In 2008, the first American Classic Green Tea was produced and available for sale. In July of 2009, Bigelow distributed 100,000 boxes of tea to U.S. soldiers serving overseas. The boxes were specially designed and featured the tagline: Thank You For Your Service! The 127-acre plantation is home to several hundred thousand tea bushes. During the growing season, approximately 5,000 pounds of tea leaves arrive at the factory for processing. The new factory features an air-conditioned window gallery that is 125 feet long. This gallery overlooks all the manufacturing equipment. There is also a gift shop. The plantation is open Monday through Saturday from 10am to 4pm year rounds. On Sunday the plantation is open 12:00pm-4:00pm. The plantation receives over 30,000 visitors each year. Touring the factory is free, but there is a $10 charge for trolley rides per person. There is an understanding that guests will not leave without purchasing tea in the gift shop. Additional information about the plantation can be obtained by calling 843-559-0383, and tea orders can be placed with Bigelow by calling the same number."
"Charleston Waterfront Park","South-Carolina","Charleston Waterfront Park - Charleston, SC - Park and Pier along Charleston Harbour","Charleston Waterfront Park runs along the Charleston harbour entry. It's 8 acres of lawns, fountains, garden rooms'' and paths, and culminates in a long pier jutting out into the harbour. It's a must for any tour of the city. The park sits in the centre of downtown, and is the perfect place for visitors to enjoy a leisurely day out. The pier and pavilion have picnic tables and family-sized wooden swings, and you can enjoy views of the ships going in and out of the harbour. If you're lucky, you might even spot a dolphin or two. The old-fashioned benches and palm-lined walkways offer a great place for families to relax and unwind. Bring a picnic along whilst your children play on the lawns, and when they want to cool off the two enormous fountains are just waiting to be jumped into. At night, the Pineapple Fountain lights up creating a beautiful spectacle. The park was designed by local landscape architects Edward Pinckney Associates Ltd, and in 2007 it received the ASLA Professional Landmark Award for its innovative design and positive impact on the community. Mayor Joseph P Riley of Charleston has deemed it this generation's gift to the future'', and it's credited with turning around and revitalising the waterfront area to make it attractive to visitors again. What was once an abandoned area by the Cooper River, it's now completely remodelled into a great green space. Great care was taken over the design of the park. They wanted to make it accessible for everyone, so rather than yacht tie-ups at the end of the pier they designed it to be used for recreational fishing. Lighting was kept to a minimum so people can see the stars at night, and they made sure that it was completely environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. They wanted to integrate Charleston's past and future, and have managed to do just that. The regeneration of the surrounding area has been another positive impact on the community. Visitors love the views from the pier and the peaceful atmosphere, and the huge fountains are definitely one of the main attractions. In the evening the park takes on a more romantic vibe, and the walks along the pier can be a special treat. Entry to the park is completely free, which is a particular bonus, and being open daily from 6am until midnight it's perfect for morning joggers, family days out and romantic evening strolls alike. You can even take in a bit of education while you're there. Look out for the plaques positioned around the pier that tell how the area has changed over the last 400 years; a great addition for any history enthusiast. The park is a must for any visitor to Charleston, where you'll be able to see why it's so popular for visitors and residents alike. And being right near the Charleston City Market, why not make a day of it and visit them both?"

The museum opens from 10am to 5pm every day except Sundays (1pm to 5pm) and Mondays when it remains closed. The original Columbia Museum of Art was opened to the public in 1950 and was housed elsewhere in the city. Then it acted as a showcase for art, natural history, and science with a planetarium and was the city's premier cultural institution in the 1950s and 60s. As the size of the art collections and costs grew, the need for more space grew more critical to the survival of the museum, and so it had to move to a new site and refocus its work purely on art. In 1998 the museum moved to its current site in downtown Columbia. It attracts over 6,000 visitors each month to view the large art collection spread over 20,000 square feet of gallery space. The current building has workspaces, art studios, 150-seat public auditorium, an art library, a souvenir shop and public reception spaces.

The museum has a substantial collection of work from the 19th century too, including a painting by Monet called L'lle Aux Orties and the winged image of Eos by Giverny and Evelyn De Morgan. More recent decorative art and sculpture from the last century is also on display here. A striking feature in front of the museum entrance is the Keenan Fountain and Apollo's Cascade, which was created by well known American sculptor Rodney Carroll. This is a 27 foot sculpture fountain commissioned by the museum, which was dedicated in September 2007. An abstract sculpture made from many metals and alloys with interactive water features, the fountain is named after the Keenan family, who had strong business connections in Columbia and contributed much to the city. The Lorick Library is part of the museum and can be used for research but does not lend books out. It is the largest library of its kind in South Carolina with some 14,000 volumes.

"Drayton Hall","South-Carolina","Drayton Hall - Charleston, SC - Colonial Architecture in a Spectacular Plantation House","Drayton Hall was built in the early 1700's, and is one of the finest and oldest-surviving examples of Georgian Palladian architecture in the US. Belonging to 7 generations of Drayton's, the house is now owned by the National Trust for Historical Preservation and welcomes thousands of visitors through its doors. Construction of Drayton Hall began in 1738 by 23-year-old John Drayton, who purchased the 350-acre plantation that the house sits upon that same year. The plantation is on the Ashley River, 12 miles from Charlestown and close to John's home of Magnolia Plantation. It was completed just 4 years later in 1742, and to this day remains one of the finest examples of colonial architecture. Since the 1700's it's been home to 7 generations of Drayton's as well as the 7 generations of African American slaves that accompanied them, and has a wealth of history locked behind its doors. In 1974 Charles and Frank Drayton sold the property to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and the house now stands as a national landmark of Georgian architecture and American colonial history alike. It came to the trust largely un-restored with much of the house remaining the same since it was built, with only minor alterations and restorations being undertaken in its almost 300-year history. The house has been beautifully preserved for future generations to enjoy, along with the acres of gardens that accompany it. It's the only plantation on the Ashley River to remain completely intact, having withstood being used as a staging ground in the Revolution, surviving the great Charleston Earthquake of 1886 even though its epicentre was just a few miles away, and avoiding being flattened by countless hurricanes since its conception. It's quite remarkable to even be standing, let alone to remain largely untouched and remodelled. It more than earns its status as a National Historic Landmark. There are professionally guided tours of the house as well as self-guided tours including maps and DVD's. Exhibitions fill the house, and visitors can also enjoy marsh and river walks, a trip to the artisan-inspired museum shop and a reflective stop at the African American cemetery, where at least 33 former slaves are buried. The house operates on seasonal times, being open from 8:30am to 5pm 1st March - 31st October, and from 9:30am to 4pm 1st November - 28th February. Guided tours operate on the hour every hour, and the last tour each day leaves at half past the hour. Entry fees range from $6 for children to $14 for adults, with children under 6 getting in free. The house and grounds are also available for private functions, corporate events and weddings, and can provide the perfect backdrop to any special occasion. After the site is closed to the general public it's all yours, and staff can help you to create the perfect moment. The Hall can only accommodate a limited number of special events per year, so make sure to book ahead to avoid disappointment."

"Edisto Island Serpentarium","South-Carolina","Edisto Island Serpentarium","Edisto Island, South Carolina  Established in 1999, the Edisto Island Serpentarium is currently celebrating 10 years of devoted service towards the world of reptiles. Currently, they offer shelter and care to four types of reptiles, namely: snakes, alligators, lizards and turtles. As humans, we oftentimes destroy and fear what we do not understand and lectures are held four times daily: 11:00am, 1:00pm, 3:00pm and 5:00pm, to educate and dispel the fear that many people have regarding snakes and other reptiles. Visitors are taught about each species and their importance in our surrounding habitat. For those who have developed a fear for snakes for whatever reason, the lectures will serve as an enlightenment to understand the true nature of this creature and to also identity poisonous from non-poisonous snakes. Alligators are another type of reptile that are hosted at the Serpentarium. With a current alligator population on 19 Adult American alligators, visitors will have a first-hand experience of learning about this particular animal, and see its behavioral patterns face to face. Feeding times for the alligators are usually 12:00 and 4:00pm daily. Each has a particular name to distinguish it based on its personality and size. The biggest which is 11 feet is an attraction and all visits are guided with tour guides to ensure the safety of each visitor. There are also lizards and turtles at Edisto Island Serpentarium, and for those who love turtles, it will be a wonderful time to see and learn about different species. There are red-eared turtles, diamondback terrapins, soft-shelled turtles etc. The African Thigh Tortoises are considered worldwide, as the the largest land turtle, and this is of particular interest of many people, because turtles are usually represented as miniature creatures in our day to day lives. The Serpentarium does not have many lizards, in fact, there are only four iguanas at the facility and they are non-venomous. For those who love reptiles, visiting Edisto Island Serpentarium, will be a memorable experience that educates and opens the horizons of anyone to see beyond the common beliefs and myths that are associated with these reptiles, especially snakes. There is also an indoor facility with hand painted reptiles and an atrium with snakes, frogs and baby alligators. This is a great place for small and anxious children who are fascinated with tiny creatures and are taking tiny step to explore their surrounding world. School excursions and biology classes are two interesting activities that are held to stimulate interest in the young about their surrounding environment and the animals that are a part of it. All the tour-guides are trained professionals that have worked for years with animals and that have in-depth knowledge of the beauty and possible danger that each reptile carries with it. With this in mind, all education information that is planned on a daily basis, intends to open the world of reptiles to curious seekers, but at the same time respecting the highest level of security between animals and visitors."
"Edisto Island State Park","South-Carolina","Edisto Island State Park","Edisto Island, South Carolina  Edisto Island State Park is a 1255 acre state park with camping facilities and an educational center, located on Edisto Island and only 50 miles from Charleston. The island itself has a history dating back thousands of years with Native Americans having been using the land for fishing and farming. In the late 1600's British Settlers and their slaves changed the landscape, by planting indigo and rice. The State Park itself was built on the island in the 1930's from Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal Program by the Civilian Conservation Corps. You can see the Spanish Mount, a 4000 year old mound of oyster, mussels, and turtle shells. The Edisto Island State Park in an effort to protect the mound from beach erosion, has built a retaining wall. The mound itself was once over 20 feet high and is now only a fraction of its former size. The Interpretive Center is a totally green'' building that has hands-on exhibits to teach about the local environment. Here, kids will get to actually touch horseshoe and hermit crabs, whelks, and play on a shrimp boat''. In the months of June, July, and August you'll be able to take a guided night beach walk for loggerhead turtles that come to lay their eggs here. In fact, campers who stay on the beach side of the camping facilities must keep their lights at night blocked because of the nesting turtles. There are several hiking trails throughout the state park with many chances to the wildlife and vegetation that call Edisto home. You'll see some of the tallest palmetto and live oak trees, Spanish moss, osprey, deer, alligator, and even maybe a bobcat. For your safety, it is recommended that you stay on the trails while keeping a watchful eye for snakes. Since ticks and mosquitoes can be a hazard in the warmer months, please be sure to wear the proper clothing while hiking. Camping facilities are available with 111 sites (some on ocean and some on the salt- marsh side) with water and electric hookups. There are some sites that are large enough to accommodate RVs up to 40 foot. Five tent sites are available with tent pads and water. All camping sites are conveniently located near the comfort station with hot water showers. Rates vary for RV or tent sites by season. Cabins are available for rent near the salt marshes. There are five 2-bedroom cabins that sleep six and two 3-bedroom cabins that also sleep six. All cabins include bed and bath linens, cooking and eating utensils, coffee maker, microwave, television, and screened-in porch. Rates vary for cabin size and season. Edisto Island State Park's general admission rates are reasonable for the entire family at $4 per adult, $1.50 per child ages 6-15, and children 5 and under are free. The park is open from 9am-6pm daily with extended hours during Daylight Savings Time."
"Edmondston-Alston House","South-Carolina","Edmondston-Alston House - Charleston, SC - Historical Dwelling on Charleston's High Battery","The Edmondston-Alston House was built in 1825, and was one of the first houses to be built on Charleston's famous High Battery that overlooks the harbour. It's one of the city's finest dwellings of the time, and is a prime example of the architecture, taste and style of the 1800's. The house was built by successful Charleston merchant Charles Edmondston of Scotland. It's the oldest house on the Battery offering fantastic views of the harbour, and was the perfect spot for Charles to keep an eye on the ships carrying his cargo. It was lavishly decorated, but unfortunately had to be sold due to the economic Panic of 1837''. It was bought and improved by Charles Alston, a well-established member of a rice-planting dynasty. He added various Greek twists to the property, including a third floor piazza, a second floor iron balcony, and a parapet to the front where he proudly displayed his family coat of arms. It was then lived in by 8 generations of the Alston family over the next 150 years. Today, the house is still in the Alston family and is open to the public under the care of the Middleton Place Foundation. Visitors can still appreciate the magnificent furniture, art, books and silverware that were bought for the house over a century and a half ago. The Alston family collected much of the items on trips abroad, and luckily a lot of them remain today, many in the rooms they were purchased for. The house offers a fine example of the architecture of the time, and is furnished beautifully. It gives visitors a fantastic insight into the life of both Charles Edmondston and the Alston family. If you really want to see and appreciate what life was like in the 1800's and beyond, a trip to the Edmondston-Alston House is for you. Take a trip to the library where you can not only see old historical books, but a revolutionary pistol as well. If you can, head down over the Christmas season where you can enjoy a re-enactment of an 1861 Christmas Eve in Charleston, and if you fancy a longer stay the carriage house has been renovated into a bed and breakfast. The piazza overlooks the harbour, and visitors can imagine the time when residents looked out onto the attack on Fort Sumter. The 3-storey house has survived a century and a half of history and has been beautifully preserved. Nestled among the other various mansions of the High Battery, it's definitely worth a visit. Combination tickets for both the Edmondston-Alston House and Middleton Place are available from either location. Guided tours of the house operate on a daily basis, from 10am to 4:30pm Tuesday to Saturday and from 1:30pm to 4:30pm Sunday and Monday. Tours are the perfect way to truly understand and appreciate the history and experiences of the time, so are well worth waiting for. The house is full of antiques and artefacts, and knowledgeable guides really paint a picture of what life was like at the time."

"Falls Park on the Reedy","South-Carolina","Falls Park on the Reedy - Greenville, South Carolina - Park by the Reedy River","Falls Park is a regional attraction which can be accessed at Main Street and West Camperdown Way, or at East Camperdown Way and Falls Street in Greenville, South Carolina. The park is open each day from 7am to 9pm and is free to enter. The park is set by the Reedy River, which is a tributary of the Saluda River, and about 65 miles long running through northwestern South Carolina. In the early part of the 20th century three textile mills and a cotton warehouse operated in the area, all contributing to the pollution of the river. Since 1967, when the Carolina Foothills Garden Club reclaimed 26 acres for the current park, they and the City of Greenville have worked with individuals, corporations and state and federal agencies to clean up the river, develop the park and restore the historic Falls Cottage. In 1990, landscape architect Andrea Mains brought about the idea of transforming the park into a tourist attraction, with beautiful public gardens and a pedestrian bridge. Open throughout the year the gardens are divided in to outside rooms and include the Falls Cottage Garden and the Governor's School Woods, which are full of ornamental and native plants. To maintain its year round interest, the park is filled with spring bulbs, perennials and many evergreen and spring flowering trees. The park endeavors to maintain plant varieties indigenous to the upper regions of South Carolina. Designed by architect Miguel Rosales, the pedestrian bridge called Liberty Bridge is the focal point of Falls Park and cost $4.5 million to build. It is 355-feet long, 12-feet wide, has a horizontal curve radius of 214-feet and 90-foot towers weighing 26 tons each, whilst the bridge's handrails are lit at night giving it a glowing effect. This is an ideal vantage point for viewing the public gardens below as well as the Reedy River Falls. Appointments can be made for tours with the Garden Manager and are geared for adult and young audiences, focusing on interpretive history and horticulture with the proceeds going to the Falls Park Endowment Fund. Families can get a Falls Park coloring book during their visit, which explains the development around Reedy River Falls, and whilst the older children or parents read the history of the park, the younger children can color in the drawings. The Reedy River Corridor Trail is a continuous paved trail along the banks of the Reedy River and can begin at any one of the area parks including Falls Park, Cleveland Park or Linky Stone Park. Various locations within the park are available for hire to stage private events.

"Finley Park","South-Carolina","Finley Park - Columbia, South Carolina - Large Picturesque Park","Finley Park is an 18 acre picturesque site situated between the streets of Assembly, Taylor, Gadsden and Laurel in Columbia, South Carolina. The park has free entry and is open each day from 7am to 9pm. It is possibly one of the best known parks in South Carolina and plays host to many events such as festivals, road races and political rallies. It was originally known as Sidney Park when it was first dedicated in 1859 in honor of Algernon Sidney Johnson, who was a councilor in the city. The first incarnation of the park was sadly short lived as the Civil War soon followed in 1861. When the war ended the park was largely left alone and it fell into disrepair, with the site only being used for commercial ventures for much of the 20th century. The park began a second life when it was reopened in 1990 to provide a striking contrast to the glass, asphalt and concrete jungle of the city. It was not until 1992 that it inherited the name of a former Mayor of Columbia, Kirkman Finley. Finley was keen to reenergize the area with a beautiful green oasis and decided to renovate the site at the former Sidney Park. The late Kirkman Finley has now been immortalized in the form of a bronze statue, which shows him sitting on a park bench surveying all around him. Visitors will note that the spelling of his name varies in different parts of the park. There seems to be some confusion as to whether the name should be spelt Finley or Finlay, so many of the official signs use the two different spellings. There are plenty of things for people of all ages to do and see at the park. For children there are two playgrounds areas, playing fields and the paved footpaths are ideal for parents to push strollers along. Visitors can also enjoy the water features such as the waterfall, fountains and a man made lake. The park is also very accessible for handicapped people, and is recognized as being one of the largest in the country to facilitate the needs of the handicapped. Public parks are obviously a good place for a family picnic, and many people chose to have their lunch on the expanse of grass in the park. There is a snack bar on site as well, which is only open during the summer months. The entire park and the Columbia skyline can be observed from porch-type swings, which are situated at the top of the park. It frequently holds free concerts and festivals, which draw in many more visitors. Visitors to the park have stated in their reviews that it is a glorious place to visit. Whether it is just to sit and relax and take in the views, taking the dog for a walk or having a picnic, people suggest it is one of the best places to visit in Columbia. The man made waterfall is a feature reviewers particularly enjoyed."

"Fort Moultrie National Monument South Carolina","South-Carolina","Fort Moultrie National Monument South Carolina","Fort Moultrie was created to defend the coast of South Carolina and has been a bedrock fort in many wars including the American Revolution and first battle of the Civil War. When the fort encountered its first attack it was not even completely finished with construction. Fort Moultrie is located off the Sullivan's Island, situated at the harbor entrance of Charleston, SC. Due to its location on the island, Fort Moultrie was originally called Fort Sullivan. It was later named after its designer and constructor, William Moultrie. The fort honors William Moultire who was said to be a military leader with remarkable abilities and prowess. The fort was constructed quickly and it was only six months before the structure was complete. Fort Moultrie National Monument was constructed in 1809. Fort Moultrie National Monument has a long history of participating in several battles. The first attack on the fort occurred in 1776, when British warships begin to bombard the fort. The fort's structure was so immaculately built that accounts state the cannon balls fired at the fort wall actually bounced off the structure. Later, during the 1870's the fort was updated and modernized. Visitors to the fort can view its restored condition. The National Park Services keeps the park in its original condition. Each area of the fort educates the public about a different time in history. The fort has participated in 171 years of defense off the seacoast. There are beautiful views of the Atlantic Ocean from different points along the monument. Large rocks and boulders separate Fort Moultrie from the sea. Visitors to Fort Moultrie National Monument can find layers of history within the walls and premises of the fort.

"Fryar's Topiary Garden","South-Carolina","Fryar's Topiary Garden - Bishopville, SC - Unique Topiaries","Fryar's Topiary Garden is located at 145 Broad Acres Road in Bishopville, South Carolina. Bishopville is located in Lee County in the northern part of the state. The Garden is developed, owned, and cared for by a man named Pearl Fryar. Fryar is an African-American who was born in 1940 and moved to Bishopville in 1975. While working at a factory there, he purchased a home on three acres of land. The Gardens began in 1984 as a personal project to win Garden of the Month in Fryar's community. The early topiary pieces were cast-offs from a local nursery. Fryar himself was unaware of topiary as an art form. In the 1990s, Fryar did win the Garden of the Month. He and his gardens have been featured on the following networks and shows: CBS's Sunday Morning, Turner South's Blue Ribbon, HGTV's Garden Diary and PBS's Victory Garden. His work has been featured in Art in America, which is a monthly magazine that has been published since the early 1900s. In addition, Fryar's work has also been featured in The Oxford American. Fryar has also had a video documentary made that is called A Man Named Pearl.'' Fryar's topiaries have been selected for museum exhibitions across the nation. His most famous ones have been featured at the American Visionary Art Museum, the South Carolina State Museum, and Spoleto Festival USA. Fryar is also a frequent speaker, and he has addressed audiences at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as well as students at the Bishopville elementary school. In addition, Fryar is the artist-in-residence at Coker College. In 2006, Winthrop University, which is located in Rock Hill, South Carolina, awarded Fryar with the Medal of Honor in the Arts. Fryar was also commissioned to develop a garden at the State Museum in Columbia, South Carolina. The Garden surrounds Fryar's brick ranch home. There are at least 40 different species of plants and trees located on the property. Topiary is a type of art that involves sculpting shrubbery and trees into various shapes, and it uses both abstract forms and real shapes. The Garden Conservancy is a national non-profit organization that is dedicated to preserving unique and significant gardens for aesthetics and education. Fryar's topiaries have been included as a preservation project so that his gardens can have a secure future. There are only 40 projects in this group. In September of 2009, Lindsey Kerr, who has her master's degree in historic preservation, was selected to pursue a twelve-week project researching Fryar's Topiary Gardens. Kerr's task is to document and research various methods and information about the Garden and Fryar's care thereof. The lawn itself is also decorative because Fryar has planted flowers in lettering that he dug into the grass itself. There are three words: love, peace, and goodwill. Fryar welcomes guests to his property Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10:00am to 4:00pm. There is no fee for admission; however, donations to assist in the care for the gardens are encouraged. The address of the property is prominent in the front yard, where the numbers 165 are topiaries."

"H.L. Hunley Submarine","South-Carolina","H.L. Hunley Submarine - Charleston, SC - Nineteenth Century Naval Treasure","A tour of the H.L. Hunley Submarine is available at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center at 1250 Supply Street in North Charleston. This location is an old Navy base by the Cooper River. While the Hunley is undergoing preservation work tours are only available on the weekends, 10:00 am to 5:00 pm on Saturdays and 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm on Sundays. All tickets are $12 each except for children under five years old, who can see the Hunley for free. Visitors are encouraged to purchase tickets in advance as tours are limited in size. The Hunley was a submarine for the Confederacy during the Civil War that had already sank twice before and killed more than thirty previous crew members. It was the first submarine to successfully sink another vessel when, in 1864, it attacked the Union owned USS Housatonic in the Charleston Harbor. Shortly thereafter the Hunley also sank, for the third and final time, with no way to communicate to those on shore about any problems and with eight crew members aboard. When the submarine was finally recovered in 2000 DNA was found for all eight crew members, who were given military honors upon interment in Magnolia Cemetery. Friends of the Hunley and the South Carolina Hunley Commission are currently working together to figure out what exactly caused the submarine to sink. The South Carolina Hunley Commission was formed to recover, preserve, and further investigate the sinking of the Hunley. Out of this commission the Friends of Hunley non-profit organization was formed. They are responsible for fundraising, conservation and the exhibit of the Hunley. The recovery of the Hunley turned out to be quite of a feat of underwater archaeology. Since the submarine was buried under sediment the first objective was to excavate so that the top third of the vessel was exposed. Then a truss was lowered on the Hunley and a crane lifted the submarine and truss with the aid of inflatable pillows. Conservation work on the Hunley began immediately because once the submarine was exposed to air, after spending nearly 140 years under water, the physical elements of the iron vessel began to change. In what has turned out to be a complex puzzle of discoveries it was revealed in October 2008 that flooding was probably not what caused the Hunley to sink. Scientists discovered that the bilge pump, used to pump water out of the submarine, had not been in use. When a submarine takes on water, using the bilge pump would be one of the first steps taken to prevent sinking. Instead it seems that the crew met a calmer end, seated at their stations at their time of death, a sign that they either knew nothing could be done or were unaware of a problem. Archaeologists believe the damage found on the submarine occurred a while after the attack on the Housatonic and was caused by coarse sand brought in and out by tides. Currently, the Hunley is submerged in a tank of water for viewing to preserve the conditions under which it survived for almost 140 years. The exhibit also features artifacts found inside the wrecked submarine, including facial reconstructions of what the crew looked like and Lieutenant George Dixon's lucky coin. A replica of the Hunley built to scale allows visitors to experience the cramped conditions of a nineteenth century submarine."

"Hampton Plantation State Historic Site","South-Carolina","Hampton Plantation State Historic Site","McClellanville, SC  If you're looking for an off the beaten path into Americana, look no further than the Hampton Plantation. Located on Highway 17 in McClellanville, South Carolina is the 18th century Hampton Plantation. The initial 600 acres of the plantation were purchased by Daniel Horry in the mid 1700s, eventually expanding to thousands where fields stretched as far as the eye can see. It now sits on only 322 acres, which is still a lot of land. This former rice plantation was once the family home to seven generations of Horrys and home to over 300 slaves, when inventory'' of the plantation's contents were done in 1786. Hampton Plantation gives an insider view of life in an antebellum plantation. The original part of the house, a fine example of Georgian architecture (including an attic and raised basement), was built in the mid 1740s using Cypress and pine wood for construction. An additional two wings were added twenty years later, even using fake windows for symmetry when the new wings were put on. The portico wasn't added until the 1790s. When the ballroom was added at the time of the additional two wings, floorboards that are approximately 40 feet long were used from wood from pine trees found on the plantation. Tours of the house show a history of the architecture with its open walls. The house sits unfurnished but you'll swear you'll hear the theme music from Gone with the Wind playing in the distance and the picturesque landscape makes for great photo opportunities since the plantation sits on the Wambaw Creek. There are the chimney ruins of the original slave cabins, house tours, a picnic area, and natural & historic programs available at Hampton Plantation for visitors. One famous visitor to Hampton Plantation was Brigadier General Francis Marion, the Revolutionary War Hero. Called the Swamp Fox'', he was the famous for his guerrilla warfare tactics against the British. Mel Gibson's movie The Patriot was loosely based on his military activities. George Washington was also another famous visitor having visited in 1791 on his Southern Tour. When Washington was asked by the owners if an old oak tree should be cut down, he told the owners that he like the tree and it was then known as the Washington Oak. Henry Middleton Rutledge returned to Hampton Plantation at the end of the Civil War and it was his son, Archibald Rutledge (born in 1883) who became a Poet Laureate. Archibald Rutledge returned to live at Hampton full-time, restoring it back to its former glory, writing the book Home by the River about this famous plantation and all its inhabitants and guests. Archibald and his family donated the Hampton Plantation to the State of South Carolina in 1971.  It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a National Historic Landmark. Entrance fee is $4 per adult, $3 per child, $2.50 for South Carolina Seniors and the park is open from 12 noon-4pm, Tuesdays thru Sunday, March to October. From November-February the park is open 12 noon-4pm Thursday thru Sunday."
"Harbour Town Golf Links","South-Carolina","Harbour Town Golf Links, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina ? Considered the Crowning Achievement of Legendary Golf Course Designer Pete Dye","The Sea Pines Resort on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina features 54 holes of golf, including the Harbour Town Golf Links course, which is considered the crowning achievement of legendary golf course architect Pete Dye, known as the father of target golf.'' The Harbour Town Golf Links course, which opened in 1969, is home to the PGA Tour's Verizon Heritage Tournament, but is considered more a test of finesse, shot-making and imagination, rather than brute strength. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 6,973 yards from the Heritage tees, short by most PGA standards, with a USGA rating of 71 but a hefty slope rating of 146 on Bermuda grass. The course features relatively few forced carries off the tee, with the exception of the par-3s, offers ample driving room on many holes, but also has some of the smallest greens on the Tour, which are also are relatively flat. Even so, Harbour Town Golf Links is a very difficult course, calling for placement and accuracy from start to finish. Even balls in the fairway, if they're not in the right position, can lead to subsequent shots that just don't work. Some of the most noteworthy holes include what golf analyst Ken Venturi calls the best set of par threes on the PGA Tour.'' Hole No. 4 is one of them, a par-3 that plays to 200 yards from the longest tees and features the Dye trademark railroad ties fronting the green bordered by water on the front left. Hole No. 7 is another, a par-3 that plays to 195 yards from the back tees. This hole features an island'' green that's surrounded by sand as well as some water. But the real hazards here are the handful of trees that surrounded and hang over a deep, narrow green. On the back nine, Dye tests players with four par-4s that will demand every skill they have. No. 10 plays to 444 yards from the back tees and asks players to gauge the wind, avoid the lake on the left side as the hole doglegs, then hit an accurate approach shot to another long, narrow green. The finishing hole on the course is another long par-4 that plays to 452 yards from the back tees. This hole is considered one of the most feared in all of golf, especially so if the wind is blowing off Calibogue Sound. With a wide landing area that juts into the Sound, the tee shot is of the grip-it-and-rip-it'' variety. It's the second shot, however, that calls for a medium iron over wetlands and bunkers to a small green, where the famous red-and-white lighthouse stands watch over the finishing hole. Among the many accolades accorded Harbour Town Golf Links is a ranking by most major golf publications among the Top 100 Courses in the U.S. and in the world. Golfweek Magazine rated it #25 on its list of America's Top 100 Modern Courses, and #12 among the nation's resort courses, while Golf Digest ranked it #14 among America's 100 Greatest Courses You Can Play. The Sea Pines Resort also offers 5,000 acres of oceanfront retreat that includes award-winning tennis facilities, luxury accommodations, beach activities, and gourmet restaurants."

This course is landscaped around a 40 foot lava rock volcano with many of the holes positioned around it to give players a different view each time. The volcano is an active one in that flames erupt from the top every 20 minutes or so for a few seconds, making the ground tremble a little.

Many visitors come to this mini golf course and are greeted by talking parrots, whilst staff presents each guest with Hawaiian leis. Reviews from past visitors to the course suggest the course if not the hardest to play in Myrtle Beach as it doesn't have many, if any hazards to negotiate. Whilst it is very well landscaped and maintained with a waterfall and palm tress, visitors should not expect to find it too challenging although this may be ideal for families with small children not wanting to get frustrated by finding the course too hard.

"Heyward-Washington House","South-Carolina","Heyward-Washington House - Charleston, SC - Colonial Charleston Life","As part of the Charleston Museum system, the Heyward-Washington House is located in historic downtown Charleston at 87 Church Street. It is open on Monday through Saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm and on Sunday from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm.

Ticket packages that combine the Charleston Museum, the Heyward-Washington House and the Joseph Manigault House are also available at a discount. The last guided tour of the House for each day is at 4:30 pm but visitors can also view the house and gardens at their own pace. Although the house was built by Daniel Heyward in 1772 it earned the Heyward-Washington name after the house was used by General George Washington during a week long stay in 1791 during his presidency. This house portrays colonial life in Charleston just as its counterpart, the Joseph Manigault House, portrays Charleston in its post-colonial years. Daniel Heyward's son, Thomas Heyward Jr., lived in the house his father built for him. He was an ardent patriot, serving in the South Carolina militia during the Revolution and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. During the war he was captured and later released. Thomas sold the house in 1794 and moved to his White Hall estate. The Charleston Museum, America's first museum, obtained the Heyward-Washington House in 1929 and it was opened in 1930, Charleston's first museum-house. Later, in 1978, it was named a National Historic Landmark. The House contains authentic and locally made furniture including a special book case reputed to be one of the best pieces of American-made furnishings. Once featured on Home and Garden Television the cabinetry inside was made by Thomas Elfe, a renowned cabinet maker in his time. Inside is a stair way landing that ended up slanted after a Charleston earthquake. The personal correspondence between John Rutledge and George Washington while planning the President's visit are on display. Two canopy beds make up the sleeping quarters and family portraits adorn the walls. Also on display is a collection of china dishware owned by the Heywards. The out buildings at the Heyward-Washington House include a kitchen constructed in the 1740s, servant's quarters, a carriage house with a well and formal gardens. The kitchen is the only historic building of its use that is open to the public. Tour guides offer information about architecture and history, including how a house was run in colonial times and how its occupants kept themselves cool during the hotter months. Architecturally the Heyward-Washington House is considered a double house with an altered Georgian style. It has two floors with four rooms each and two chimneys. The second floor is more elaborate than the simple bottom floor. Fancy ceiling cornices, shuttered windows and paneled walls set the second story as a place of entertainment. Only one room and part of a hallway have been reconstructed, in 1929, and the rest of the House is original."

Historic Brattonsville is home to the Bratton Plantation, which was owned and housed three generations of the Bratton family. One of the first buildings most visitors see, Hightower Hall was built in 1856 for John Simpson Bratton Jr. and Harriet Rainey Bratton, his wife. Their daughter, Sophia, continued to live in there with her husband after her parents died. Throughout this time period, the building was called Forrest Hall and was the seat of the plantation. In 1958, the Drapers purchased the house. The Drapers sold the house to the York County Historical Commission, and it then became part of Historical Brattonsville. In the early 1960s, the house became known as Hightower Hall. Hightower Hall underwent an extensive restoration that began in 2007 in order to restore some of the antebellum architecture. The house has hosted parties, weddings, and receptions. Civil War re-enactments have also taken place here. Hightower Hall was also a film location for Mel Gibson's movie The Patriot. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Historic Brattonsville offers the visitors access to over 30 historic structures. Visitors can see the development of the Carolina Piedmont area from the 1750s through the 1840s by visiting house museums that chronicle the development of the area during this era. Historic Brattonsville also features African-American interpretation of this historic time. Visitors can watch a reenactment of the Battle of Huck's Defeat. This battle took place on July 12, 1780. Captain Christian Huck, a Loyalist, was sent to apprehend Williams Bratton and John McClure at their homes. At the time, British forces were attempting to break up groups of American Patriots. Bratton, along with other Patriots, wound up taking the Loyalists by surprise and defeated Huck's men. This battle served as a rallying point that helped revive Patriot morale and led to future Patriot victories. Home to a Heritage Farm Program that has won awards, Historic Brattonsville is also used to raise and care for some of the same rare breeds of farm animals that were housed here during Revolutionary War times. Devon cattle, Gulf Coast sheep, and Ossabaw Island hogs can be found on the premises.

They have owned and trained horses for over three decades, and the center is now run by their son and his family. Between 1861 and 1863 the plantation was the home of the confederate Fort Randall where 9,000 confederate soldiers cleared the open fields at the entrance to the stables. The tree line along the IntraCoastal Waterway served as a barrier from the enemy ships. The property was once home to Billy the Kid, and Blackbeard the pirate was said to have used the owners' private island as a safe haven, whilst Indian burial grounds and archeological finds dating back to 600 b.c are to be found at the plantation. The center offers various riding experiences, including beach rides, plantation trail rides, pony rides and a UTV excursion. The beach rides are for ages 10 and above and last for two hours, taking guests through the plantation and crossing a bridge to Waites Island. Here guests can explore the wide beaches of the privately owned 1,200-acre island, and observe many shore and song birds. The plantation trail rides are for ages seven and above and last for one hour beginning next to a pecan grove and riding through the 4,000 acre plantation. Here riders may see many different birds and possibly deer and bears before heading along parts of the Intracoastal Waterway. Children under the age of 10 don't miss out as they can take a half hour pony trek through the pecan groves. The Smith family have 30 horses of several different breeds Tennessee Walkers, Belgians and Appaloosas. Horses can be leased on a weekly or monthly basis and experienced riders will be allowed to canter along the trails. Various riding packages are available at the center as well as customized birthday parties, whilst there are also horse riding lessons offered and a Saturday Pony Club for children aged 7 to 13, which runs from 10am to 1pm.

A maximum of five peple per vehicle can then try out surf fishing, shell collecting or sunbathing on the island. Full boarding is available at the plantation for overnight and long stays, with the assurance of an on-site manager and 24 hour security. Visitors to this destination have generally commented very favorably towards it, saying the horses are well tended and the guides very helpful. The center has horses that are suitable for varying degrees of skill level, so it is important for visitors to be honest about their level of riding ability. People also suggested taking some snacks for the horses such as carrots or apples."

The cost of admission is $10 for adults and $5 for children. Tickets can be purchased as a package with the museum and the Heyward-Washington House for a discounted price. Open year round, the Joseph Manigault House, which celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2003, operates on Monday through Saturday from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm and on Sunday from 1:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The last tour of the House begins at 4:30 pm but visitors can also peruse the House unguided. This house is part of a package available that includes five houses, an art museum, gardens, and the Charleston Museum. The Charleston Heritage Passport costs $44.95 for access to these locations over a two day period, or $64.95 for access through an entire year. Joseph Manigault, the original inhabitant of the house, amassed his wealth from plantations and was a representative in South Carolina's state legislature. His brother, Gabriel, was the designer of the Federal-style architecture and also designed the City Hall in Charleston. The National Historic Monument was completed in 1803. The House is an historic representation of Charleston in the early nineteenth century. Made possible by the booming rice agriculture, the Manigault House portrays the life of a wealthy family in the early 1800s, complete with authentic furniture, back yard garden and several out buildings. Furniture inside the Manigault House is part of the Charleston Museum and contains pieces of the time from America, England and France. Some of these furnishings are known to be owned, originally, by the Manigault family. The out buildings include a kitchen, a privy and slave housing but only their foundations remain. At the center of the garden stands a Gate Temple and a circular stair case inside the house is popular among visitors who want to explore this three story townhouse. The Manigault family sold the house in 1852 and it subsequently became run down with multiple families living within as tenants. Later, in the early 1900s, the house was in danger of being demolished to make way for a parking lot or gas station. It wasn't until 1920, when Susan Pringle Frost founded the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings, that the house was saved for preservation. The Charleston Museum received the house in a deed transfer from a wealthy woman, named Mrs. Henrietta Politzer, but it was unable to open it to the public until 1949 due to lack of funds. They then were able to gain back corners of the property that held a gas station and a dry cleaner. When the gas station was in operation it offered free tours of the house with the purchase of a full tank of gas. Mrs. Politzter was also able to donate a few items to get the collection inside the house started, such as the chandelier that hangs in the foyer. As a holiday bonus, the Joseph Manigault house is decorated by the Garden Club of Charleston for the Christmas season. The Garden Club attempts to only use real flowers that were available to the residents of Charleston in the nineteenth century."

"King's North at Myrtle Beach National, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - a Myrtle Beach Top-Shelf Tradition, Now Redesigned by Arnold Palmer in 1996","South-Carolina","King's North at Myrtle Beach National, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - a Myrtle Beach Top-Shelf Tradition, Now Redesigned by Arnold Palmer in 1996","Since first opening in 1973, the North Course at Myrtle Beach National was one of the most requested and recognized golf courses in Myrtle Beach for nearly 25 years. Then, in 1996, Arnold Palmer and his Palmer Design Group were asked to return and transform the North Course into something brand new. The redesign started as something quick and dirty,'' but turned into a major renovation that involved $4 million in improvements. While the routing of the course remained the same, the renovations included tearing up the fairways and greens, installing a myriad of new bunkers, and increasing the course length to more than 7,000 yards from the tips. A total of 400,000 cubic yards of dirt was moved, thousands of azaleas were added, along with hundreds of hardwood trees, and lakes, bunkers and greens were all enlarged. The end product transformed the beaten and battered'' traditional style of the former North Course into a semi-modern course laden with bunkers and a mixture of holes, from links-style to contemporary. The front and back nines were also reversed, changing the numbers and order in which the course is played. According to the head golf professional, no two holes on the revamped course are the same, but the layout now calls for a good deal of course management. Proper placement and position in the fairways is essential, or one could end up in a waste bunker, and there are a lot of undulations in the new greens. There are also still a good many dogleg par-4s throughout, which adds to the challenge and shot selection. If played from the forward men's tees, the course is very short at only 5,702 yards. From the middle tees, the course plays to 6,431 yards, which means players who can keep their ball in the fairway and putt with some authority on the slow-rolling Bentgrass greens can score well. The course features a number of noteworthy holes. Hole No. 6, nicknamed The Gambler,'' features an island fairway, which affords golfers the ultimate risk/reward shortcut to the green, or a disastrous adventure should they fail on either of two precise shots that are required. The signature par-3 No. 12 hole (formerly No. 3), still sports an island green and sand traps shaped like South Carolina. During the renovations, the green was enlarged and given a wooden bulkhead for added definition. Hole No. 18, nicknamed The Bull's-Eye'' by GOLF Magazine, now boasts 42 sand bunkers after its redesign. While the traps may not come into play, golfers have described it as intimidating, playing through a sea of sand'' in this fairway, followed by an approach to a green that reaches out into a lake. Since re-opening in 1996, King's North has received even more acclaim. Golf Digest ranked it among America's Top 10 New Upscale Courses, the National Golf Course Owners Association named it South Carolina's Course of the Year in 1997, and hole Nos. 6, 14, 16 and 18 are all featured in the book The 100 Greatest Holes Along the Grand Strand."

"Magnolia Plantation and Gardens","South-Carolina","Magnolia Plantation and Gardens - Charleston, SC - Beautiful Historical Gardens","The Magnolia Plantation and Gardens is one of the oldest public tourist sites in the Lowcountry, dating back to Colonial times, and by the end of the 19th century it became and continues to be one of the most popular attractions in Charleston. The plantation was founded by the Drayton family in 1676, and by the 1680's the first residence of the plantation was completed. Since then more than three centuries of the Drayton family have lived there in three homes, with the gardens and grounds first being opened to the public in 1872. This makes the Magnolia Plantation the oldest public gardens in America. Today, the main house of the site is open to the public offering guided tours every hour. The core of this house was actually built in Summerville, SC before being floated down the Ashley River to take up residence in Magnolia after the Civil War. Visitors will be able to learn all about the history of the house and the Drayton family, with 10 rooms being open to the public offering a glimpse of plantation life in the 19th century. The rooms are filled with early American antiques, porcelain and a huge number of other Drayton family heirlooms. The gardens are a sight to behold, with some sections being more than 325 years old. Being largely un-restored, visitors can see the vision of the Drayton family, who added to and expanded it with each generation. There are a huge variety of flowers on display; horticulturalists will be in their element. If you can, head down in spring where it will be full of life and color and you can really appreciate it at its best. Be sure to check out the Audubon Swamp Garden as well, where you can see this wild landscape by traveling over boardwalks, bridges and dikes.

"May River Golf Club at Palmetto Bluff","South-Carolina","May River Golf Club at Palmetto Bluff, Bluffton, South Carolina ? a Jack Nicklaus-Designed Signature Course Named the Best New Golf Course in South Carolina in 2005","The May River Golf Club is a Jack Nicklaus-designed signature course at the Palmetto Bluff resort. The course is set amid the May River Forest and its 300-year-old live oaks, and the layout twists and turns through the trees and along the banks of the May River, from which it derives its name. The course, which opened in 2004, features wide fairways that include strategically placed bunkers and several natural waste areas that set up the typical risk/reward option off the tee. Very little earth was moved during course construction, and Nicklaus made use of the existing land to create a Lowcountry environment. The course is said to play firm and fast, with tightly mowed banks and gently undulating green complexes, which are a defining feature of the course. The surrounding swales and collection areas transition so seamlessly to the putting surface that they are virtually negative edge'' green complexes, making it both easy and confounding to putt the ball from off the green...or see a chip or putt go through the green and run right off of it. The greens also tend to be well-guarded by white-sand bunkers of differing sizes, shapes and depths. The sand is also a unique feature of the course, as Nicklaus imported special sand, which features an angular grain, from Ohio. The special sand promotes better adhesion, which reduces maintenance after the coastal storms common to the area. The 18-hole, par-72 layout plays to 7,171 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.4 and a slope rating of 140. While technically a resort course,'' May River Golf Club is said to have the look, feel and conditioning of a fine private golf club. The tee areas and fairways play on Paspalum, a new, eco-friendly turf, while the green complexes are Bermuda grass. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course are its par-3s, which have been described as art-collection worthy.'' Hole No. 6 is a prime example, and is one of four signature holes on the course. This par-3 hole plays to 175 yards and features a forced carry past some tall trees, over water and rough to a green that's well-guarded by a number of bunkers. Hole No. 11 is another of May River's picturesque par-3s. This hole plays to 169 yards to a long, narrow, elevated green nestled beside a large pond on the right and trees on the left. Adding to the private-club'' feel of May River Golf Club, caddie service is required with each round, and players are encouraged to walk the course. Practice facilities include a driving range with tee boxes at both ends, a specially shaped fairway, and target greens with bunkers. There's also a five-acre short-game practice area with four regulation-size greens, complete with bunkers. Golf instruction is also available from certified PGA Professional instructors. The course also features the May River Golf House, a clubhouse designed to classic American golf style. Inside are a golf shop, locker rooms, and the May River Grill for casual dining."
"Medieval Times","South-Carolina","Medieval Times - Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - Adventure Castle","Medieval Times takes the guests back to 11th century Spain and was first introduced as an entertainment on the Spanish island of Majorca back in 1973 before spreading to North America ten years later. It was inspired by the tradition of royal families inviting guests to a festival and banquet to watch the knights compete against each other on horseback. The castle at Myrtle Beach opened in 1995, and here as with the other castles, the weapons such as lances and bolas, and the costumes don't change but the story lines and characters are always evolving. As visitors arrive at the castle they are given a crown to wear with a special color on it. This signifies which knight the guest has been assigned to, and as such they are seated in a specific area of the arena where they can cheer and support their knight. There are six knights at the castle and their colors are Yellow, Red, Black and White, Blue, Red and Yellow and Green. The entertainment takes place as guests tuck in to a four-course meal that includes soup, roast chicken, spare ribs, apple pastry and hot or cold drinks, whilst there is also a vegetarian option if required. Food is served as it would have been in medieval times, which means no cutlery and just the use of hands. The entertainment comes in the form of horse riding with clever stunts, jousting and the big competition between the six knights, who are all fighting for the hand of the beautiful Princess Leonore under the watchful eye of King Philippe. The owning company raises most of their 400 horses at Medieval Times' Chapel Creek Ranch in Sanger, Texas. Their breeds include Friesians and Menorcans and Spanish Andalusians, with the latter a horse revered by medieval royalty for its great strength, agility and temperament. The horses do not move to the other castles until the age of three where they are taught advanced-level dressage until they are ready for public performances. Another feature of the show sees the Royal Falconer displaying his birds of prey as the tournament includes a live flight of the royal falcon, soaring over the heads of the guests. Visitors over the age of 13 can sign up to the Birthday Fellowship, which enables them to go to the castle on their birthday and enjoy the banquet and tournament for free. There are many other attractions close to the castle, especially golf courses, and also several hotels including Harbour Lights Resort and the Holiday Inn at Myrtle Beach."

"Middleton Place","South-Carolina","Middleton Place - Charleston, SC - 18th Century Plantation","Middleton Place plantation was built in the early 1700's, and has been the home to four generations of the Middleton family. It runs along the banks of the Ashley River and is home to one of the oldest landscaped gardens in America. Built in the colonial era, the 200-acre plantation was acquired by the Middleton family in 1741 when Henry Middleton married his wife Mary. Soon after, construction began on the gardens. This was said to have taken 10 years to complete by over 100 slaves working seasonally, and in 1755 the property was improved by adding two dependencies on each side of the three-story house. The house has survived revolution, civil war, fire and earthquakes, and lives to tell the tale. Since being opened to the public in 1975 the plantation has welcomed thousands of visitors, and is now a National Historical Landmark. The Middleton Place House Museum is now owned and operated by the Middleton Place Foundation who keeps the house open to the public so they can enjoy all the history it has to offer. The gardens are spectacular, and showcase some of the finest landscaping of their time. They're famed for their beautiful geometry and symmetry, and was the most ornate and unique gardens to be seen in the 18th century. 65 acres of landscaping now await the visitor, who can walk the same paths as the Middleton's did all those centuries ago.

"Morris Island Lighthouse","South-Carolina","Morris Island Lighthouse - Charleston, SC - An Historic Island Lighthouse","A few hundred yards off the shore of Folly Beach, South Carolina sits the Morris Island Lighthouse. Once an island unto its self, with several out buildings, all that remains of Morris Island is the horizontally striped lighthouse. In order to prevent the nearby Charleston Harbor from closing, several jetties were formed in 1889 to keep channels open, causing severe erosion. Morris Island was one such casualty. Patterned after the Bodie Lighthouse in North Carolina, the Morris Island Lighthouse has wide horizontal stripes that are dark grey and white. Standing nearly 160 feet tall the lighthouse is viewable from the bridge to Folly Beach and the northeast part of Folly Beach from East Ashley Street. There is a short walk from the parking area to a good viewing point and the view from the beach is said to be particularly good during sunset, when the low sun casts a glow on the lighthouse. Some hotels or boat charters in the area offer low tide boat rides to the lighthouse but entry into the actual structure is strictly forbidden, given its run down condition. During low tide there is enough sand to walk around on and people can collect shells or sand dollars. It is not recommended to try to walk or swim out to the lighthouse from Folly Beach during any tide, low or high. There are very strong currents and rip tides that are dangerous for swimmers. Visitors attempting to access the Morris Island Lighthouse by swimming or wading have drowned in their attempts to do so. Although no longer lighting up the sky as lighthouses are intended to do there are restoration and conservation efforts underway to keep the Morris Island Lighthouse a part of the historic coastal South Carolina landscape. Instead, the Sullivan Island Lighthouse is lit. Through the years the lighthouse has withstood hurricanes and earthquakes but it is rapidly facing the tests of time and development. There are currently two groups working to keep the lighthouse intact: the Morris Island Coalition and Save the Light. The Morris Island Coalition is made up of civic, conservation and preservation groups from all over the country. They aim to help the lighthouse become recognized as a national historic treasure that is in serious jeopardy. The Coalition fights residential and commercial development that is harmful to migratory birds and will further cause erosion damage. Save the Light, a non-profit organization that relies on contributions and membership of the public, has undertaken the planning, fund raising and execution of various preservation projects for the Morris Island Lighthouse. They began as a group of concerned citizens and ended up buying Morris Island, sold it to the state of South Carolina, and now lease the island for their preservation and conservation efforts. With the help of the Army Corps of Engineers, Save the Light has undertaken construction projects to protect the lighthouse. They have raised over 4.5 million dollars and completed a cofferdam in 2008 that will help to prevent further erosion of Morris Island. There are additional projects in the works by Save the Light with the Army Corps of Engineers."
"Mt. Atlanticus","South-Carolina","Mt. Atlanticus - Myrtle Beach, South Carolina - Miniature Golf Course","Mt. Atlanticus is a miniature golf attraction located at 707 N. Kings Highway in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and is approximately 20 minutes drive from Myrtle Beach International Airport. It is built inside and on top of an old Chapin Company department store, its parking garage and other ground space, and this forms part of the theme of the course, as in how did a mini-golf course get in a department store? There are two courses called Minotaur and Conch, which start indoors and intertwine as they move outside. The biggest theme of the course centers on the story of the lost city of Atlantis, and incorporates other myths and legends as well. It also includes creatures like dodo birds, ostriches, and mythical things like a fountain of youth, the loch ness monster and Minotaurs all forming part of the courses. All the holes have different challenges with numerous hazards such as rocks, whilst some more traditional obstacles associated with a golf course are here too such as sand traps, tall grass and water. The building features a series of rooms containing very surreal murals, which followed loosely the course theme of myths and legends. Several murals depict the evolution of a creature composed of half Minotaur and half golfer. The attraction fuses mythical creations old and relatively new, with another mural featuring a crowd of naked people waiting to be beamed up to a UFO. There is a large practice area before participants start with both courses moving up and down the multi-tiers of the facility, whilst visiting tropical huts, palm trees and caves on the way. The third hole moves outside and is on the second level of the parking garage, before the courses lead visitors down a mountain, around and over the lakes. Halfway through the course, players make their way back up the mountain back to the second level of the parking garage. It finally reaches the fourth story of the building at the 18th hole in a tower hut, whilst visiting tropical huts, palm trees and caves on the way. There is a 19th hole, which is very difficult but gives the player a chance to win a lifetime pass. They win this prize if they can hole a slight downhill putt along a 20-foot strip that is no wider than 6 inches, and if they miss the hole the ball goes in the water. This miniature golf center is open all year round except for Christmas Day and visitors can either purchase tickets for one round of golf, or buy an all day ticket. Opening times are 10am to 9pm Monday to Thursday, and 10am to 10pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The site, which is close to where the Myrtle Beach Pavilion Amusement Park used to be, is very close to the ocean front leaving visitors with a very short walk to and from the beach as well as a number of inns and motels."

"Nathaniel Russell House","South-Carolina","Nathaniel Russell House - Charleston, SC - Historical Town House","The Nathaniel Russell House was completed in 1808, and offers a fine example of the architecture of the time. Once the home of Nathaniel Russell, today it's a National Historical Landmark and is one of America's most important neoclassical dwellings. Construction began on the house in 1803 by respected Charleston merchant Nathaniel Russell, and it was finished 5 years later. In 1808, 70-year-old Nathaniel and his family, as well as their 18 slaves, moved into their new home. It was considered to be one of the finest dwellings in Charleston of the time. The house remained in the family until 1857, when it was sold to the Allston's after daughter Sarah's death. It has since been owned by a number of families and organizations, before being opened to the public as a museum in 1956. Despite being under attack from hurricanes and earthquakes alike, the house still stands in fine form. Visitors can still appreciate the grandeur of the house today. It sits in spacious formal gardens and has a magnificent interior, full of ornate plasterwork and even a huge free-flowing staircase. The geometrically-shaped rooms are styled beautifully, really showing the styles and architecture of the time. It's furnished with much of the original pieces that the Russell family purchased for their home, and truly showcases the life of the elite. Period antiques and fine art fill the house, making it a museum in its own right. Today, visitors can see not only what life was like for the elite, but for the slaves of the time as well. The house has been home to generations of African-American slaves as well as the Russell's and other families, and they were key to the running of the home. Living in the upper rooms of the building, often the kitchen/laundry and stable buildings, the slaves were responsible for the daily operations of the home. Their quarters can still be seen, offering a marked contrast between their lives and the lives of the rich. The main rooms offer the finest architectural designs of the time, and they're all decorated in turn-of-the-century style. Located in Downtown Charleston near High Battery, the house is the most southern point of Charleston's historic Museum Mile, offering the best collection of cultural sites in Charleston. Tours operate daily, with guides being on hand to offer a wealth of knowledge. Being well versed in the history of the house and the time period alike, it would be well worth waiting for the tour to really understand what life was like and to experience the half a dozen rooms open to the public. Also spare time to wander around the beautiful gardens to the exterior of the property. The house is open daily, Monday-Saturday 10am until 5pm and Sunday 2pm-5pm. Tours operate every day for visitors to really understand life of the time, with the last tour starting at 4:30pm.

"Robert Mills Historic House and Park - Columbia","South-Carolina","Robert Mills Historic House and Park - Columbia, South Carolina Historic Museum, Landmark and Ornamental Gardens","The Robert Mills House is one of only five historic landmarks in the city of Columbia in South Carolina. It is situated in Blanding Street and the house and garden are open to the public every day except Mondays and major holidays. Guided tours are provided at the top of the hour. The house was designed by the house's namesake Robert Mills, who was one of the first native born Americans to become a professional architect. He designed the house for an Englishman Ainsley Hall and his wife Sarah in 1823. Mills rarely worked on private residences and is chiefly remembered for designing the Washington Monument, which wasn't completed until 29 years after Mills' death. Sadly Hall died before the house was completed and after his outdated will was contested, Sarah decided to sell the house. The Presbyterian Synod of South Carolina and Georgia bought the house and established a seminary there until they moved to Georgia in 1927. Following various changes of ownership the house came close to being demolished in the 1960s, but was saved and opened as a house museum by the Historic Foundation of Columbia in 1967. Robert Mills, who was born in South Carolina, was renowned for designing buildings in the Classical Revival style and this house was no exception. He used classical features such as symmetry, a protruding Greek style porch and large Ionic columns at the front of the house. The back is equally as grand with a wide porch and large columns and small arches. There are many historic pieces of art, furniture and photographs collected by the Historic Foundation of Columbia, which are maintained at the house. Some of the furniture on display is from around the early 19th century period when Mills designed the house. The pieces of art and furniture vary in style from American Federal, English Regency and French empire furniture. The historic museum, which was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973, also boasts a large garden. Under the stewardship of the Presbyterian Synod, the house was used mainly for religious and educational purposes, so no great attention was paid to the grounds. The gardens were landscaped and made very ornamental in the late 1960s to reflect early 19th century inspired English gardens. The ornamental part of the garden features statues, pergolas, formal planting and pathways and has been designated The Founders' Garden''. It was established to complement the style of the house and is being used to emphasize heritage plants and plant conservation and sustainable planting practices. The grounds can be privately hired for special events, but the house is not available for rent. As well as the gardens, the carriage house can be hired for special events, and is also used as a classroom space for educational programs. There are two other buildings flanking the main house. One of these is a library, whilst the other has a museum gift shop for visitors to purchase souvenirs."

"Sheldon Church Ruins","South-Carolina","Sheldon Church Ruins - Sheldon, SC - Church Walls Still Stand After Being Burnt Twice","Originally known as Prince William's Parish Church, Sheldon Church was built between 1745 and 1753. The Sheldon Church Ruins are located between Beaufort and Yemassee on Old Sheldon Road off of Highway 21. Sheldon Church was funded by William Bull in the 1740s and 1750s. Bull was Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina, and he died before the church was even completed. As a sign of respect, Bull was buried at the base of the altar inside the church. Surprisingly, his stone grave marker is also still in its place after so many years. Sheldon Church got its name from Bull's plantation, which was named Sheldon Plantation. Sheldon Church has the unfortunate distinction of having been burned twice. During the Revolutionary War, the church was set on fire when British General Augustine Prevost invaded the area in 1779. In 1826, the church was rebuilt using the surviving walls of the original structure. On January 14, 1865, the church was burned a second time when it was set on fire by Sherman's troops during his March to the Sea'' campaign. The walls of the church never fell after the fire, but the church was also never repaired. It is possible that a third disaster befell the church. Published by the University of South Carolina Press, The Leverett Letters allude to the fact that the church was gutted by people in need of materials to rebuild their homes after Sherman's troops burned them down while on their march. In spite of the fires and possible ransacking, the church walls and pillars remain standing. While the windows, interior, pediment, and gable roof are long gone, some of the design still remains. The church was built in the Greek Revival style and was one of the first structures built in the United States that actually featured this style. Sheldon Church Ruins lie amongst scattered graves and serene oak trees. The Ruins can be picturesque, and the site has become a popular location for weddings. St. Helena's Parish is the caretaking organization for the Ruins. Reservations are requires for events like weddings, and the reservations need to be made with St. Helena's Parish. With its majestic trees and lush grass, the Ruins have become a scenic destination that is also rich in the history of the area. A public service is held at the Ruins each year on the second Sunday after Easter. Portions of Sheldon Church's old gate remain intact, and an old hand-operated pump can still be seen on the grounds near the gate. The pump actually still functions. The Ruins also features a tablet that was placed in 1937 by the Columbia Committee South Carolina Society Colonial Dames of America. The tablet provides a brief summary of the history of the church up until that time. There is no charge for admission to the Sheldon Church Ruins, and the Ruins are open to visitors from dusk to dawn daily. There is not much space for cars to park by the side of the road, but a parking overflow area is located across from the gate."

"South Carolina Railroad Museum","South-Carolina","South Carolina Railroad Museum - Winnsboro, SC - Official Railroad Museum","The South Carolina Railroad Museum is located near I-77 and SC-34 in Winnsboro, South Carolina. Winnsboro is located in Fairfield County, which is north of Columbia, South Carolina. It is a non-profit organization with no paid employees. The purpose of the Museum is to preserve and interpret railroading in South Carolina, and their goals are exclusively scientific and educational. The Museum performs the task of collecting and preserving information as well as equipment related to railroading in South Carolina and in Southeastern US. The Museum was started in 1973 by railroad enthusiasts. Ten years later, the Museum gained the Rockton and Rion Railways. These railways once served the granite quarries in Rion and Anderson in South Carolina. They were among the last railroads to utilize steam engines regularly. The Museum has acquired other pieces of railroad history, including cars, engines, and cabooses. Currently, the Museum runs trains along a five mile stretch of the former eleven mile railway. There are plans to utilize the entire eleven miles of rail. The current machinery roster lists twelve locomotives, eight of which were formerly run in US military service. The earliest locomotive in stock is the Baldwin #712, which was built in 1903. Baldwin Locomotive Works was known for their steam engines. The Museum owns 14 passenger cars. Of these, there are two baggage cars and one dinner car. There is also a Pullman 6-3 Sleeper car that was built in 1924. There are seventeen freight cars; the oldest is an 1895 flat car #234. Finally, the Museum owns six cabooses, which include a Cupola from 1924 and two transfers built in 1955. Beyond on-track machinery, the Museum also owns several hoppers, tampers, and cranes. Tampers are used for packing the ballast beneath tracks as well as adjusting the tracks themselves. The locomotive crane #3000 that is owned by the Museum shows heavy rusting. Even so, it is a dynamic find for the Museum because locomotive cranes have the capacity to perform lifts while serving as a locomotive for attached cars. The Museum offers train rides in summer and fall, with trains scheduled to run thrice daily on Saturdays. During summer and fall, the Museum is open 9:30am - 3:30pm on Saturdays.

"St. Stephen's Episcopal Church","South-Carolina","St. Stephen's Episcopal Church - Saint Stephen, SC - Church with Original Brick from 240 Years Ago","Located at 196 Brick Church Circle in Saint Stephen, South Carolina, St. Stephen's Episcopal Church is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a National Historic Landmark. At the time that St. Stephen's was established in 1754, a wooden chapel already existed. The Parish decided to replace the wooden structure with a brick building. Building of the brick church did not even begin until 1767. The church building was completed in 1769. The brick church was designed and built by Francis Villepontoux and A. Howard, who also provided the bricks for the building. The church is a small brick country parish church and was built on a rectangular plan. The master mason for the project was William Axson. Axson was a Freemason and inscribed the Masonic insignia and his name on one of the ground bricks located above the chancel window. To this day, the brick church has been well-preserved and features a gambrel roof. The preservation of the brickwork and several of the features of the church building and grounds are what make St. Stephen's a destination for the historically inclined. Visitors can enjoy the distinctive architecture of the church. The church was not neglected in spite of the fact that services were not held regularly between 1808 and 1932. During the 19th century, the church was repaired twice. Currently, St. Stephen's is undergoing restoration and also being painted. The church building is actively used today and is part of the Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina. On April 5, 2009, St. Stephen's celebrated its 240th anniversary (based on the year the church was completed). In honor of this milestone, St. Stephen's Outreach Committee planned a re-creation event. Led by Reverend Jeffery R. Richardson, the anniversary service began at 11:00am. Many visitors and church members wore costumes from the era in which the church building was built. The 1662 Book of Common Prayer was used for the Holy Communion. After the anniversary service, St. Stephen's held a family picnic, and the food was served out of old cast iron pots. The food consisted of items that would have been eaten during the period that the church was completed. Charleston's Channel 2 News filmed the event and aired portions of it. Their coverage featured the fact that St. Stephen's is rich in history. It also highlighted the American Revolution and Civil War ancestral cemetery markers that surround the church. In addition to the markers, the original bricks of the building remain, and two of these bricks bear the signatures of the brick makers. St. Stephen's holds services on Sundays and Wednesdays. Sunday service begins at 8:45am and is followed by hospitality time. On Wednesday, service begins at 6:30pm and is followed by Bible Study and Supper. In addition to worship services, St. Stephen's has a Worship Committee, a Wardens & Budget Committee, and a Mission Council, and each group typically meets monthly. Reverend Jeffrey R. Richardson is the Vicar at St. Stephen's. Reverend William H. Holmes served as Deacon until his retirement in June of 2009. Additional staff at St. Stephen's include a Sr. Warden, a Jr. Warden, 3 Mission Council Members, a Music Director, a Churchyard Coordinator, and a Treasurer. Anyone wishing to obtain additional information about St. Stephen's can do so by calling the church directly at 843-567-3419."

Due to a series of fires, changes in architects, and other unfortunate events, the building of the State House took over 50 years and around $3,540,000. It was declared completed in 1903. Renovations took place between 1995 through 1998. The State House is made of granite and has a dome, which is covered with 44,000 pounds of copper. Seen from the interior, the dome is actually a false dome for aesthetic reasons and is meant to be viewed from the center of the Main Lobby.  There is a room between the false dome and the actual dome so that the flags at the top of the State Capitol can be raised and lowered. One of the main exterior characteristics of the State Building is its Corinthian, columns which are considered amongst the largest in the world. They are approximately 43 feet high and are monolithic. Another distinctive feature is the two hand-carved axes on the front door. The State House and its grounds are home to many beautiful monuments, markers, portraits, plaques, and other works of art. Some of these distinctive monuments, markers, and statues include: the George Washington bronze statue, the Confederate Soldier Monument, the 6 Bronze Star Markers, the African American Monument, the Battleship Maine Gun Monument, the S.C. Law Enforcement Officers Monument, and many others. The 6 bronze stars mark the places on the building that were hit by shells from the Union cannons. Other buildings on the grounds include the Wade Hampton Building, the Calhoun Building, the Brown Building, the Gressette Building, the Blatt Building, and the Dennis Building. The first floor of the State House is made up of white marble walls with white and pink marble flooring. The Lieutenant Governor's Office is located in the east wing of the first floor.

Some of the wood and the cast iron columns date back to 1887. Another feature that is located inside the State House is the Joint Legislative Conference Room, which is the library. The library's chandelier, mosaic glass windows, and spiral staircases render it one of the most beautiful rooms. Within the State House, there are a number of portraits.

"Swan Lake - Iris Gardens - Sumter, SC - Treasure of Irises and Swans","South-Carolina","Swan Lake - Iris Gardens - Sumter, SC - Treasure of Irises and Swans","Swan Lake - Iris Gardens dates back to 1927, which is when Hamilton Carr Bland, a local businessman, removed many plants from his residence and had them sent to a 30 acre area nearby. Bland had imported a large number of flowers from the Far East. Many of these flowers were irises and had failed to bloom properly at his home. The next season, these transplanted bulbs blossomed. In 1938, A.T. Heath, Sr. deeded 120 acres to the City of Sumter with the obligation that Bland continued to develop the area. In 1949, Bland also deeded his acreage to Sumter. In 1994 and 1998, two other families contributed property as well. Local lore maintains that there are over four million irises on the property, including the Japanese Hanashobu'' or Iris Kaempferi, which is the most cultivated iris in Japanese gardens. These irises flower in reddish-purple hues and blossom late in the season. There are many other varieties of plant life, such as azaleas, camellias, and Japanese magnolias. Japanese magnolias are native to China and blossom in the early spring. The tree population is diverse and includes oak and cypress. Bland also imported a large number of swans to the area, and several visitors and residents have contributed to the gardens by donating birds. Currently, the Swan Lake - Iris Gardens is the only public park in the United States to have eight species of swans. The swan species are the Royal White Mutes, the Black Necks, the Coscorobas, the Whoopers, the Black Australians, the Whistlers, the Bewicks, and the Trumpeters. The Black Australian swan's is native to Australia, and they were first discovered in 1790. These were the first fowl that Bland imported and have been in the area the longest. They have black feathers and a red bill. These swans are generally the most social of the swans. The Bewick swan is a subspecies of the Tundra swan and cousin species of the Whistler swan. They are native to Northern Russia but have migrated to Japan and the British Isles. The Bewick swans were donated in 1997 by the Yuasa-Exide Corporation.

"The Dunes Golf & Beach Club, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ? Considered by Many to Be the Masterpiece of Legendary Designer Robert Trent Jones, Sr","South-Carolina","The Dunes Golf & Beach Club, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ? Considered by Many to Be the Masterpiece of Legendary Designer Robert Trent Jones, Sr","The Dunes Golf & Beach Club was formed in 1947 by Myrtle Beach-area businessmen, who commissioned famed golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, Sr. to design the course. The result is considered some of his best work and features some of his favorite design elements, such as well-defined fairway bunkers and huge, elevated greens, to go along with the area's rolling terrain and views of the Atlantic Ocean. In 1992, Jones oversaw an extensive renovation to the course, wherein the original greens were replaced with Penn Links Bent grass, six holes were modified to make them more player friendly, Hole No. 8 received a new tee box, and the green on Hole No. 11 was relocated. In 2001, another set of renovations were made to the practice facilities and the course by Rees Jones, the son of the original designer. A unique alternate hole'' was added between Nos. 13 and 14 for use if/when another hole is closed for maintenance. Hole No. 18 was also given a new tee box that allows the hole to be played as either a dogleg left or the original dogleg right. A-1 Bent grass was also installed on the greens and all the greens were restored to their original shapes. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which reopened in 2003, plays to 7,165 yards from the longest tees with a slope rating of 141. The course is said to test golfers off the tee, from the fairways and on the greens. A number of green complexes feature large, penalizing bunkers that front the putting surfaces. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 13, the signature hole for the course. Nicknamed Waterloo,'' this par-5 plays to a hefty 590 yards from the longest tees and a respectable 545 yards from the Blues. Known worldwide, this hole doglegs right around Lake Singleton and has been honored and acclaimed over the years as one of the greatest golf holes in the world. Assuming tee shots land safely, the second and third shorts dare golfers to cut off as much of the lake as they can, while playing uphill toward a small, tiered green. The Dunes Golf & Beach Club has also received its share of honors and awards, including a ranking at #38 by Golf Digest on its 2009-2010 list of America's Top 100 Great Public Courses. Practice facilities include a renovated driving range that was expanded in 2001 by 30 yards in length and 40 yards in depth, more than doubling the number of hitting stations. The Dunes Club also features an expansive clubhouse that features a Ballroom and an oceanfront lawn, which makes it one of the most desirable locations on the Grand Stand for weddings. In addition to golf, the club also features one of the best tennis programs in the Myrtle Beach area."

The Collection is located within the Hampton House Bed & Breakfast. The 50+ doll houses in the collection mainly consist of antiques. The Collection includes 36 room boxes and a large collection of china, bisque, and antique dolls. The bed and breakfast and the Collection are both owned by Diane Forde and her husband, Henry Ruthinoski. A portrait artist and former window designer, Diane Forde has had a fascination with doll houses since childhood. She once included a doll house in one of the displays at her art gallery. She wound up keeping the doll house for years after the display ended. After this, she began purchasing doll houses at yard sales. Eventually, Forde and Ruthinoski began building doll houses together. Diane then began formulating the idea for a doll house conservatory of sorts. As a person who loves antiques, Forde decided that they would focus their efforts on antique doll houses. This is how the Forde Doll & Doll house Collection began. The couple moved to South Carolina in 2005. In 2006, they opened the Hampton House Bed & Breakfast and installed their collection of doll houses. The Collection includes miniatures from the United States and also contains miniatures from Germany, Japan, and Korea. The doll houses can be inspected in the living room of the Hampton House, which is a building that dates back to 1912. Most of the houses that the couple procured came from antique stores, from the internet, or by word of mouth. Forde would simply get calls from people who heard of her collection and had something to offer. The Collection features a variety of structures, such as Bliss and Gottschalk houses and tin houses from the 1950s. Several homemade doll houses are also included in the Collection. Forde uses an extensive collection of doll house books to help identify who made a particular miniature. This helps ensure that the house is filled with appropriate furniture. The Collection also features paper dolls and antique dolls. In addition to the Collection, Hampton House offers afternoon tea parties. These tea parties are offered on Fridays and Saturdays at 12:00pm and 3:30pm. Tea parties are available to groups of eight. The cost is $22.50 per person.

"The Heritage Club, Pawleys Island, South Carolina - the #1 Golf Course on the Grand Strand, According to Golf Digest","South-Carolina","The Heritage Club, Pawleys Island, South Carolina - the #1 Golf Course on the Grand Strand, According to Golf Digest","The Heritage Club is the centerpiece of the Legends Resort, situated on Pawleys Island in the Grand Strand of the Myrtle Beach area, between the Atlantic Ocean, the Intracoastal Watery and the banks of the Waccamaw River. Set amid 600 acres of ancient oak trees, giant magnolias, blossoming rice fields, lakes and marshes, the course features rolling, spacious fairways and some of the largest, most undulating greens found in the Grand Strand. The 18-hole, par-71 course, which opened in 1986, plays to 7,118 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.3 and a slope rating of 145, making for a challenging round. The course is set between two former rice and indigo plantations, and features some heavily landscaped areas of wildflowers, flowering shrubs, and stands of crepe myrtle, camellias and azaleas, giving the course a good deal of Lowcountry charm. Another noteworthy element of the course is its green complexes, which have been described as extraordinary.'' The greens can stretch to more than 50 yards deep and most of them feature multiple levels. Depending on pin placement, club selection can vary by up to two lengths. Many of the holes also feature doglegs and narrow landing zones, including the short, par-4 No. 9 hole. The hole plays to 354 yards from the back tees, and after a pinched landing zone, darts sharply right then plays uphill to a long, narrow green guarded by bunkers front and back. The entire back nine is said to be a fantastic string of holes and possibly the best nine on the Island, which features a number of renowned golf courses. The back nine features a mixture of forested and open water holes that play along the Waccamaw River. Hole No. 13 is a par-3 that plays up to 228 yards and is all forced carry over water to a peninsula green that's narrow but 50 yards deep. No. 14 is another picturesque and challenging water hole, a par-4 that plays to 426 yards from the longest tees. There's a forced carry off the tee to the landing area, and players must decide how much of the water hazard to bite off as the hole doglegs left around the water. From there, approach shots take aim at an elevated, two-tiered green that's fronted by water and guarded by a sand trap on the right. Hole No. 18 has been described as dramatic.'' This par-5 plays to slightly over 500 yards from the longest tees and is another dogleg left, this time with water running along the outside/right the length of the hole. The water also juts into the fairway right before the massive green, making for another peninsula putting area and a challenging approach shot. Since opening, The Heritage Club has received numerous accolades and awards, including being ranked among the 50 Best Public Golf Courses in America, #33 among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play, and the #1 course on the Grand Strand in 2009 by Golf Digest. In addition to championship golf, the Legends Resort features swimming, a health club and yacht facilities, as well as luxury Golf Villas for lodging, along with other amenities. There are also several dining choices, including the Ailsa Pub and the clubhouse, which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner."

It is a 114-acre site featuring restaurants, shops, entertainment establishments and residential properties. The Market Common is essentially an urban village decorated with landscaped parks, lakes and a public square. The site was originally a World War II training and coastal patrol base when it was developed in 1940. After the war the Air Force took over the base until the early 1990s, when in 1993 the area was transformed in to the Market Common by the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base Redevelopment Authority and developer McCaffery Interests. As well as the shops and restaurants, the new development added 180 residential units built above the retailers and 3,000 units ranging from live/work town houses to more expensive family homes. This village is one mile away from Myrtle Beach's white sandy beaches and the Atlantic Ocean and two miles from Myrtle Beach State Park, so it is a convenient location for tourists to stay. Bookings can be made through Resort Quest located in the village, where there are one and two bedroom suite studios located above the shops and restaurants. These include the Kensington and Radcliffe buildings, which overlook Reed Street and its landscaped greenway, gazebo and shops as well as the Ashley building in Reed Street and its one and two bedroom condos overlooking Farrow Parkway and Grand Park Lake. There are over 40 different stores in the shopping and entertainment center, which opens Monday to Saturday from 10am to 8pm and Sunday Noon to 6pm, whilst in the summer opening times are Monday to Saturday 10am to 9pm and Sundays 11am to 7pm. A large number of stores sell ladies, men and children clothing as well as sportswear, with more than ten shops also selling shoes. The area also boasts several jewelers, shops selling ladies accessories, health and beauty and places to purchase gifts for friends and family at home, as well as a number of specialty stores, sport, music, books and toy stores.

"The Ocean Course","South-Carolina","The Ocean Course, Kiawah Island, South Carolina - Ranked by Golf Digest as The Toughest Resort Golf Course in the U.S","The Kiawah Island Golf Resort features five golf courses, including The Ocean Course, which is a Pete Dye design that opened in 1991. The course is located on the eastern-most end of the island and features more seaside holes than any other golf course in the Northern Hemisphere. Ten holes play right alongside the Atlantic Ocean, while the other eight holes run parallel to them. Originally, Dye designed the course to sit behind dunes and afford it some protection from the ocean winds. His wife, Alice, however, suggested the course be raised so as to allow unobstructed views of the Atlantic from every hole. The downside to that change, however, exposed the course to the area's brisk, unpredictable sea breezes. Perhaps no other course in the world, aside from those in the United Kingdom and Ireland, is so affected by wind as The Ocean Course. From one day to the next, it's been reported that the wind can make up to an 8-club difference on a given hole. The wind, Dye's penchant for designing golf courses that make high-handicappers want to cry Uncle,'' and the natural landscaping all contributed to a #1-ranking by Golf Digest on its list of America's 50 Toughest Resort Golf Courses. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,296 yards from the longest tees with a daunting slope rating of 152 on Bermuda grass. Hole No. 2 is the first example of some of the challenges to be found on The Ocean Course. This par-5 plays to 543 yards from the back tees and features a fairway framed by ancient live oak trees. Dye himself called this hole diabolical,'' as it also features two crossings over marshland and an approach shot to an elevated green that sits between two dune ridges in the front and back. Hole No. 4 is similarly demanding, a long par-4 that plays to 453 yards from the back tees and can play as the toughest hole on the front nine. As before, there are two forced carries over marshland required on this hole. In addition, depending on distance and how the wind is blowing, approach shots to a large green can vary greatly. In GOLF Magazine's Par 2000, this hole was rated one of the Best 500 Holes in Golf. Since its opening, The Ocean Course has been showered with accolades. Golf Digest named it the #1 Golf Course in South Carolina, while also ranking it #25 on its list of 100 Greatest Golf Courses and #4 on the list of Best Public Golf Courses. The Ocean Course has also played host to such tournaments as the 1991 Ryder Cup Matches, the World Cup of Golf in 1997, and the PGA Professional National Championship in 2005. The course also features its own clubhouse, designed by noted architect Robert A. M. Stern Architects with a weathered, seaside exterior. The 24,000-square-foot clubhouse is home to a Pro Shop, locker rooms, an 80-seat upscale restaurant, and an outdoor dining porch near the ocean.

"Tidewater Golf Club","South-Carolina","Tidewater Golf Club, North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina ? Known as the ``Pebble Beach of the East''","Tidewater Golf Club is the design of Ken Tomlinson, whose goal was to create a course with the qualities that could attract a national championship or even the Ryder Cup Matches. The course opened to public play in 1990 and immediately assumed its position as one of the best courses in South Carolina and the country, even being described as the Pebble Beach of the East.'' The course is situated in the Tidewater community, which sits high atop a peninsula bluff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. A saltwater marsh and ocean inlet adjoin the course on the east, while the Intracoastal Waterway runs alongside several holes on the north and west sides. The course plays along the natural contours of the land and features a variety of elevation changes not typically found in seaside South Carolina. The course also features a number of heavily wooded holes, and thick stands of hardwoods may even have players thinking they're playing one of the finer courses in New England. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to more than 7,150 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.9 and a slope rating of 140 on Bermuda grass. The design is considered classic, yet contemporary, and the course is said to be tougher than most. The course has also been described as a journey,'' as it twists, turns and winds from one hole to the next. Tidewater is also said to be a beautiful course, with impeccable TifEagle grass greens that rival any in the country, and lush, well-manicured fairways and bunkers. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 3, which was voted the Best Par-3 on the Grand Strand.'' The hole is not especially long, playing to only 157 yards from the Black tees, but wind could impact club selection. The green is undulating and guarded by several large bunkers, however, as well as marshland long and left. Hole No. 12 is the signature hole for the course, a very intimidating par-3 that plays to 198 yards from the longest tees. Depending upon the wind, the hole can play even tougher as tee shots must carry the marsh and avoid the bunkers that surround the front and right side of the green. The green also slopes away toward the marsh, adding to the difficulty. Since its opening, Tidewater Golf Club has been accorded many honors and awards. It achieved a rare feat being named Best New Course by both Golf Digest and GOLF Magazine, as well as being ranked among the Best Courses You Can Play in 2007 by Golfweek Magazine.

"Trinity Episcopal Cathedral","South-Carolina","Trinity Episcopal Cathedral - Columbia, SC - A Church with Many Programs","The Trinity Episcopal Cathedral is located at 1100 Sumter Street in Columbia, South Carolina, and traces its history back to 1814. The location was spared during the Union Army's burning of Columbia. The present architecture began in 1845. This conversion changed the early church from a wooden structure to the current Gothic Revival style. The architect, Edward Brickell White, was influenced by the Gothic style that has been revived in England, particularly in Ecclesiastical form. The fazade of the cathedral faces west. The cathedral, which can be reached by calling 803-771-7300, is located across the street from the South Carolina State House grounds. Adjacent to the cathedral is the churchyard, in which many notable South Carolinians were buried. These include: General Wade Hampton and six South Carolina governors. Historic oak trees shade the area and the churchyard is surrounded by an iron fence. In 2006, the cathedral pledged nearly $6 million for repairs and renovations. The renovations are expected to be completed in time for the location's bicentennial anniversary in 2012. Individual contributions for this project continue to be accepted. In February of 1971, the cathedral was added to the U.S. National Registry of Historic Places. The cathedral is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Upper South Carolina. During the summertime, May through September, the cathedral offers three Sunday services. Services are held at 8am, 10am, and 6pm. During the week, services are held at the following times: Mondays at 5:15pm, Tuesdays at 12:15pm, Wednesdays at 7:30am, and at 12:15pm on Thursdays and Fridays. The cathedral admits over 4,200 baptized members. Members are encouraged to participate in several service guilds that support and maintain the church services. These include: The Acolyte Guild, the Altar Guild, the Flower Guild, lectors, ushers, and greeters. The cathedral also provides Eucharistic Visitors who will bring the Eucharist to infirm members of the congregation. The Trinity Foundation is the financial vehicle that handles the allocation of contributions that fall outside of general operational costs. There are several different choirs for members to join. The Cathedral Choir is 36 members and has toured Europe several times. They lead the Sunday morning music service. Admission is granted via audition. There are also boys and girls choirs, which are for children in the third grade or higher.

"USS Yorktown","South-Carolina","USS Yorktown - Charleston SC - Historical Naval Ship of World War II","The USS Yorktown (CV-10) is a US naval aircraft carrier built during the Second World War. Commissioned in April 1943, the ship participated in several campaigns during its time before being decommissioned in 1970 and becoming a historical landmark in 1975. Now, the USS Yorktown is a museum ship residing in Patriot's Point, South Carolina. The ship was the tenth aircraft carrier to serve in the US Navy, and was built in 1941 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. The ship was originally named the Bon Homme Richard, but was renamed the Yorktown when the USS Yorktown (CV-5) was lost in the Battle of Midway in June 1942. It then became the fourth ship to bear the name, commemorating the Battle of Yorktown of the American Revolutionary War in 1781. The ship took over 16 months to build and was launched on 21 January 1943. On April 15th of the same year the ship was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard to be commanded by Capt Joseph J Clark, and from there she started her career in the Navy. During her time she earned 11 battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for service in the Second World War, as well as 5 battle stars for Vietnam service. She's also been somewhat of a film star, having the Academy Award winning 1944 documentary The Fighting Lady'' almost entirely filmed on board, as well as being used for the 1970 movie Tora! Tora! Tora!''. After being decommissioned in 1970, the Yorktown spent 5 years in reserve before being taken to Charleston to be the centerpiece of Patriot's Point Naval and Maritime museum. On the 200-year anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975, she was officially dedicated as a war memorial. Since then countless visitors have boarded the ship, and many can fail to be amazed by the sheer size of it. Weighing in at 27,000 and being 872 feet long and up to 147.5 feet wide, she's a sight to behold. Despite her grand size she managed to reach a speed of 33 knots or nearly 40 miles an hour during her time in service, and housed a massive 90-100 aircraft in her enormous hanger bays. The ship still houses some of the planes today in various exhibitions. There aren't any specific tours but it's self-guided with all the information you need, and as such you can spend as much or as little time on each exhibit as you like. Be prepared to spend around 3-4 hours there to make sure you see everything, and sensible shoes are a must - as you can imagine, there are rather a lot of stairways and ladders in such an enormous ship. Patriot's Point is open daily from 9am to 6:30pm, only being closed on Christmas Day. Admission prices range from $8 for children (aged 6-11) to $16 for adults and children age $12 and over. Children under 6 and active military personnel in uniform get in free, and seniors and military personnel with ID get in for $13."

"Walk Where the Civil War Began at Fort Sumter in Charleston, SC","South-Carolina","Walk Where the Civil War Began at Fort Sumter in Charleston, SC","A visit to Fort Sumter (SC) in Charleston harbor is a step into the history of the U.S. Civil War. This fortress was constructed between 1830 and 1860. The Fort was built to complement the existing forts, Moultrie, Johnson and Castle Pinckney, thus strengthening harbor defenses. But shortly after the election of President Abraham Lincoln, and prior to his assuming office, South Carolina declared its secession from the Union. In December of 1860, six days after this first secession from the Union was announced, Major Robert Anderson secretly moved his troops to Fort Sumter from the older Fort Moultrie, considering Sumter to be an easier position to defend in the case of an attack. This was the first deployment to the new base though it was short lived; the fort immediately came under siege. Less than four months later, on April 12, 1861, Brigadier General Beauregard a Confederate Commander gave the order to fire on the fort after Anderson refused to surrender to him. Fort Sumter (SC) came under artillery fire from the surrounding forts and a floating battery in the harbor, initiating the Civil War. Thirty four hours later, Anderson and his troops surrendered to the Confederates and the Union Army would spend ensuing years trying to retake the fort. It was not until 1865 that General Sherman retook the stronghold, leaving it in ruins. The Spanish-American War of 1898 prompted the initial reconstruction of the outpost in order to strengthen the city's defenses. Today Fort Sumter (SC) is a national monument operated and maintained by the U.S. National Parks Service. Visits can be made by private boats as well as local tours with the Fort Sumter Tours ferry that departs daily, with the exception of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. The fairy departs from 1 to 3 times daily, (depending of the day). Ferries depart from the Patriot Points Marine Museum in Mount Pleasant as well as from Liberty Square in downtown Charleston. From downtown Charleston, a 30 minute Ferry ride across the harbor is a relaxing way to prepare to step into this historic afternoon. National Park Rangers greet visitors upon arrival at the fort and are at the ready to answer any questions that are not addressed in the narrated tour. Civil war artifacts and artillery are on display. The pentagon shaped fort was constructed on a man-made island. It was built from granite (brought from quarries in the north) and sea shells. To withstand cannon fire its walls were built with a thickness of eight to twelve feet. A visit to Fort Sumter, (SC) is just one of the numerous activities to be found in the Charleston area. It's a short journey to the other forts such as Fort Moultrie or to nearby beaches. Downtown Charleston itself is full of historic buildings with colonial charm, first rate restaurants, a diversity of bars and clubs as well as a wide range of stores, theaters, an aquarium and all of the services of any major U.S. city."
