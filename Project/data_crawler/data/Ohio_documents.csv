The animals are tame and will come up to the car in anticipation of being fed, allowing for many exemplary photographic opportunities. At the park, visitors will get to view two types of camels. The Bactrian is a two-humped camel which hails from the continent of Asia. The Dromedary camels have one hump and come from the deserts of the Middle East. The camels are the least shy of all the animals featured at the park, and camel rides are offered as part of the complete park experience.

"Avalon Lakes Golf Course","Ohio","Avalon Lakes Golf Course, Warren, Ohio ? Redesigned by Pete Dye in 2001 to Be a Tournament Quality Golf Course","Avalon Lakes Golf Course was originally built in 1967, but a renovation in 2001 by designer Pete Dye dramatically changed the character of the course. Once a flat course, Dye's redesign called for moving 300,000 cubic yards of earth to provide a great deal of elevation changes. Some reviewers have even described the mounding that can be found around the fairways, greens and everywhere else as a near-moonscape at times.'' Water now comes into play on 12 of the holes as well, while the fairways range from generous and wide-open on some holes to unforgivably narrow on others. The course also features a large number of bunkers, about 140 that are in play, including some devilish pot bunkers. The greens tend to play firm and fast, but getting onto the greens is made more difficult by Dye's use of mounding around greens to deflect shots that come up short. Not only do the mounds create an optical illusion on approach shots and putts, but wayward shots will have trouble finding a flat lie for up and downs. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a hefty 7,551 yards from the longest (Position 5) tees, with a USGA rating of 76.9 and a slope rating of 143. Those numbers are a testament to the tournament-caliber quality of the course, which is a gallery-style layout that annually hosts the LPGA Tour's Youngstown/Warren Tournament. Most players will probably choose the Position 4 or Position 3 tees, which play to a much more manageable 6,932 and 6,491 yards respectively. Some of the more memorable holes on the course include No. 8, which has been described as the 17th at Sawgrass on steroids.'' This par-3 plays up to 244 yards from the back tees, but under 200 yards from the others. The green is essentially an island, with water guarding the hole left, front and behind. With a visually appealing rock wall, this hole is regarded as one of the prettiest on the course. Hole No. 11 is a par-5 that plays up to 567 yards from the tips and offers a picturesque view from the tee. This is the #1-handicap, a water hole that calls for a forced carry off the tee, while trees and bunkers guard the landing zone. The green is also guarded by water and bunkers, with only a narrow opening in the front. The two finishing holes at Avalon Lakes are both challenging. Hole No. 17 only plays to 395 yards from Position 4, but with water guarding the entire right side, the tee shot can be daunting. On the approach, a large mound obscures the green from view, while the putting surface runs away and toward the water. Hole No. 18 is a long par-4, playing to over 500 yards from the back tees. The fairway is a narrow chute that runs through trees and winds around a complex of rising bunkers. As players approach the green, the view has been said to be astounding, with a bunker complex right, a fountain and the Avalon Building in the background. Since its redesign, Avalon Lakes has received several honors, including being ranked #67 on the Golf Digest list of Top 100 Public Courses. Practice facilities at Avalon Lakes include a grass driving range with five target greens and a fairway bunker, along with a chipping and putting area. The course also features the Avalon Holdings Building, which gives the course the feel of an elegant estate."

"Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in Dayton, Ohio","Ohio","Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in Dayton, Ohio","Started in 1893, as a part of the Dayton Public Library and Museum, the Dayton Museum of Natural History traces its early roots. The early exhibits consisted of artifacts and collections that residents of Dayton gathered on trips around the world and then donated to the museum. A group of citizens formed the Dayton Society of Natural History in 1952, took charge of the collections and organized them into the Dayton Museum of Natural History. The main building was completed in 1958, and a planetarium and additional exhibit space and an expanded collection were added in 1991. In 1993, with the intent of forming a children's museum, a group of interested citizens and community leaders banded together and formed a committee. The idea was to imbibe children ages 2-12, with a lifelong love of learning and to form an appreciation for the world around them. As the idea gained momentum, the organization realized it shared a similar mission with the Dayton Museum of Natural History. In the summer of 1995, the Children's Museum Board and the Board of the Dayton Society of Natural History formed a merger, resulting in the birth of the Dayton Museum of Discovery. The name was changed to the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in 1999, to honor Oscar Boonshoft one of the museums most devoted friends. The Boonshoft Museum of Discovery features exhibits dedicated to a creative balance between fun and learning. The displays are designed to engage visitors and make learning about the subject matter interesting and informing. The exhibits are selected 3-4 years in advance and are chosen by the Society's Exhibit Committee. The Oscar Boonshoft Science Central exhibit features a Do-Lab, an area where children can do experiments with a knowledgeable staff member from the Education Department. In the Science Central exhibit area is a Bernoulli Blower, which is a large sphere which appears to be suspended in mid-air with no ropes, poles or plates. Kids are invited to learn about the properties of air molecules in a very exciting and entertaining way. Also found in the Science Central exhibit area is a water table, a manipulative area, a color wall, construction zone and a gravitron. The Boonshoft Museum has a collection of more than 100 animals and insects scattered all over the museum. The Charles E. Exley, Jr. Wild Ohio Zoo exhibit showcases animals native to the state of Ohio. The zoo area has a prairie habitat, a temperate forest habitat and a wetland habitat, each containing a wide array of animal and plant life. Other permanent exhibits of notable interest are Explorers Crossing, the Mead Tree House, That Kid's Playce designed for toddlers, the African Room, the Vectran Glowing Geology display, the Sonoran Desert, the Bieser Discovery Center, the Tidal Pool, the Computer Center and the Three-Story Climbing Tower and Slide. While the museum has several permanent exhibits, the facility also offers a number of interactive and interesting temporary exhibits showcased throughout the year. Exhibits at the museum are focused on a broad range of scientific and educational disciplines and designed to appeal to the diverse mix of guests who visit each year. The Boonshoft Museum is opened Monday through Friday from 9 am until 5 pm, and Saturday from 11 am until 5pm and on Sunday from 12 pm until5 pm. The facility is closed on New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Easter."
"Carew Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio is a Notable Skycraper","Ohio","Carew Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio is a Notable Skycraper","	The tallest building in Cincinnati, Ohio, standing 49 stories and 574 feet tall, the Carew Tower is a National Historic Landmark. Built from 1929 to 1931, this skyscraper overlooks the Ohio River and has had many uses in its almost eight decades. The Carew Tower was designed by the architectural firm W.W. Ahlschlager & Associates with Delano & Aldrich and developed by John J. Emery, according to historic records. It was largely considered to be a city within a city'' and was one of the first mixed-use skyscrapers in the Midwest, boasting offices, apartments, and retail establishments. Construction on this Art Deco-style building began just before the stock market crash of 1929 and because of that, much of its Art Deco ornamentation was scaled down in order to save money. On the exterior of the Carew Tower, everything above the third floor is very plain. There are, however, a number of Art Deco touches throughout the interior, including the Palm Court, which is considered one of the world's best examples of French Art Deco architecture. Marble floors and iron railings are commonplace. Records show that this beautiful building contains, in all, 9 miles of brass piping, 15 railroad cars full of glass, 40 railroad cars full of stone, 60 miles of floor and window molding, 41 elevators, 15,000 tons of structural steel, and 4 million bricks. It was quite a project, given the tough times the country was currently experiencing. The final price for the structure was $3 million and it took only 13 months to complete, with workers toiling around the clock. The tower is named for its longest tenant, the Mabley and Carew Department Store, which occupied several of the floors from 1930 until 1960. Since that time, a variety of other stores have replaced the signature department store. Today's Carew Tower still includes offices, shops, and a hotel, currently the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza, a luxury establishment that uses the ornate Palm Court as its centerpiece restaurant. Another notable feature of the tower is the 49th floor observation deck, which is open to the general public. A visit to the deck requires an elevator ride to the 45th floor and a walk up a few flights of steps to the observation area. It offers one of the best views of the city, allowing visitors to see several miles in any direction when the weather is clear. Operators of the deck say it is one of the city's least visited attractions though one of its best and most affordable, costing only a few dollars admission fee. It is open daily with varying hours. Currently, the stores at Carew Tower range from popular women's apparel shops to upscale jewelry stores and kitschy souvenir shops. There are also a few places at the tower where visitors can grab a quick bite to eat or a cup of coffee. Parking is available in several nearby garages."

"Children's Museum of Cleveland, Ohio Perfect for Little Imaginations","Ohio","Children's Museum of Cleveland, Ohio Perfect for Little Imaginations","	Designed for the enjoyment and education of children from birth to age eight, the Children's Museum of Cleveland, Ohio is the only museum of its kind in the Cleveland vicinity. The museum was established in 1981 and was the brainchild of a coalition of educators, parents, and civic leaders. The museum was an instant hit with parents of young children as well as local pre-school and elementary school educators. Because of its popularity, it chose to expand and move to a larger facility in 1986, choosing a site that once home to an old Howard Johnson's Restaurant. The Children's Museum of Cleveland expanded yet again in 1993 by adding 2,000 square feet of exhibition space and more permanent exhibitions. However, the late 90s and the new millennium brought difficult times for the museum, faced with competition from other entities designed to entertain young children. In the late 1990s, the museum was rescued by local Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, and has spent the last decade or so designing a new image for the museum, hoping to reach both regional and national audiences. The new mission of the Children's Museum of Cleveland is to foster creativity via exhibits, be a key child development resource for parents and caregivers, create tools to enhance school readiness and literacy, be a partner and collaborator for early childhood educators, and provide a town center''-type environment where parents and children can interact together. The museum achieves those goals through their exhibits and educational programs. Some of the permanent exhibits at Children's Museum of Cleveland include Blast Off!, a hands-on family exhibit developed with the help of NASA that explores space through play activities; Splish Splash, a water exhibit that teaches children about earth's water systems, weather, and water transportation; Bridges to our Community, a celebration of the diversity of Cleveland, set in a makeshift neighborhood that teaches children about everyday tasks and jobs; and Big Red Barn, an area for the museum's tiniest visitors, modeled after a working farm. The museum also hosts a plethora of temporary exhibits each year, mostly remaining at Children's Museum of Cleveland for at least a few months. As a designated partner in play and learning for the young children of the Cleveland area, the museum hosts a number of special events and programs throughout the year. Patrons can also rent the facility for birthday parties. For these parties, the museum offers a room that holds up to 40 people, refrigeration facilities for food and beverages, and free admission to the museum for all party guests. Tours of the Children's Museum of Cleveland are self-guided except for school and other groups, which are treated to 90 minutes with a museum interpreter and guided visits of three of the museum's exhibits. The museum, located in the busy University Circle cultural area, is open daily throughout the year. Free parking is available. Children's Museum of Cleveland is accessible to people with disabilities."

The idea for the museum center was proposed in 1986 by Mayor Jerry Springer and was voted into reality by the people of Hamilton County. It has been named as of the top 50 architecturally significant buildings in America'' by the American Institute of Architects. Currently, the Cincinnati Museum Center houses several different museums and a large OMNIMAX Theater. The Cincinnati History Museum, which opened in 1990 when the station was first renovated, is one of the largest urban history museums in the United States. Exhibits tell the story of the city and its surrounding regions. Displays include a re-creation of the Cincinnati Public Landing in the 1800s, a World War II homefront'' exhibit featuring an old streetcar, and an excellent miniature model of the city from 1900-1940. Costumed interpreters bring history to life for the museum's visitors. Also, this museum sponsors a number of history-oriented activities for all ages all year long. The Duke Energy Children's Museum opened in 1998 and publications often rank it as among the top 10 children's museums in the world. Designed for children approximately 8 and under, this excellent hands-on museum is divided into eight exhibit areas, each outlining unique aspects of the world around us. Two rooms are designed especially for preschool visitors. In addition, the Duke Energy Children's Museum estimates that they present some 1,800 hours of programming for young visitors each year, focusing on a variety of topics including the arts, culture, reading, and science.

This area was the main control tower for the Cincinnati Union Terminal and it remains open to the public for tours several days each week. The terminal also still functions as a railway station. In 1991, shortly after the Cincinnati Museum Center opened, Amtrak passenger service resumed at the location. The terminal is a joy to explore, especially for architecture buffs, as it is considered one of the best examples of modern architecture of that era. Especially notable are the colorful 12-foot mosaics designed by German-born artist Winold Reiss in 1932. These murals depict a wide variety of topics from the city's early Native American routes to some of its specific industries, such as Baldwin Piano and Procter and Gamble."

"Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport - Cincinnati OH Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Flights","Ohio","Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport - Cincinnati OH Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport Flights","The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport recently celebrated its 60th birthday. The first plane landed at the airport in 1947. The airport quickly became a popular transit point and Delta had a large presence there. Delta's struggles in the early 2000's caused a number of reductions in service at the airport, but the recent Northwest-Delta merger is expected to bring some relief on that front. The airport is technically in Kentucky, but serves the greater Cincinnati airport. There are no low cost carriers at the airport, and studies have shown that the airport has some of the highest ticket prices in the nation. However, in February of 2009, Delta committed to a large scale fare reduction program to address concerns by locals of predatory pricing practices. Residents and transitory travelers are expected to be able to see a reduction in fare prices of up to 50% if advertisements are to be believed. The airport has two terminals in service, with a third in reserve'' and currently being used as administrative offices. The third terminal was repurposed after the Delta bankruptcy reduced flights, but does put the airport in a good position to expand rapidly for other carriers who would like to service the area. The Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport is primarily accessible by car. Most locals drive to the airport. Bus service is available on the TANK bus 2X into downtown Cincinnati. The airport is also home to a number of interesting murals that were created during the Great Depression. The 14 mosaics are done in the Art Deco style. Movie lovers will be interested to note that the murals are featured in Rain Man as a back drop for a number of scenes with Dustin Hoffman. As all of the mosaics are still preserved in the airport thanks to local historical efforts, it is possible to recreate movie moments with the mosaics."

Operated by Cleveland Metroparks since 1975 - a system of nature preserves in Greater Cleveland that encircle the city - the zoo covers 165 acres and is accredited by the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo began on a 73-acre plot of land on the West Oval of the University Circle area of the city. Fourteen deer were the first inhabitants. For the most part, during the early years, Cleveland Zoo animals were mostly indigenous to the area. However, more exotic animals arrived in the 1930s, and in 1940, the Cleveland Museum of Natural History took over management of the zoo. Some favorite attractions were added during that era, including Monkey Island and the African Safari. From 1957 until 1975, the zoo was under the control of the Cleveland Zoological Society. Accreditation was received in 1982 after Metroparks took over. Currently, Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is divided into 6 different sections: African Savanna, Australian Adventure, Northern Trek, The Rain Forest, Waterfowl Lake, and a Primate, Cat, and Aquatics section.

"Coney Island Park in Cincinnati, Ohio is a Family Fun Destination","Ohio","Coney Island Park in Cincinnati, Ohio is a Family Fun Destination","	Located on the banks of the Ohio River, east of Cincinnati's downtown area in a region known as California, Coney Island Park is an amusement park that has been attracting visitors for more than 120 years. The park had its beginnings as an apple orchard, owned by local farmer James Parker. Recognizing the value of his riverfront orchard, Parker chose to turn it into a recreation spot for the people of Cincinnati and beyond. In the 1880s, he sold the plot of land to the Ohio Grove Corporation, who opened an amusement area there in 1886 and called it Grove Park, the Coney Island of the West.'' The Grove Park portion of the name was dropped a year later. The park grew over the decades, until it was purchased by Taft Broadcasting in 1969. Unfortunately, the company closed the amusement area in 1971 and moved many of the rides to another of their properties, nearby Kings Island. A music center was added in 1984 and Coney Island became the summer home of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Pops. In 1992, the park became its own entity and began to re-establish itself as a traditional amusement park. Today, Coney Island Park is one of Cincinnati's most visited attractions, patronized by both locals and visitors, and is vastly more affordable than many of the country's larger amusement parks. The owners, however, continue to add to Coney Island's collection of classic rides and continually make attempts to expand the park's appeal to visitors. One of the highlights of Coney Island Park is the Sunlite Pool. One of the first attractions built at the park, this 200 by 400 foot pool was built in 1925 and holds more than an acre of shallow water, a deep end for diving, and lap lanes for those who wish to exercise. Four waterslides make their way into the pool, including the 2009-built Twister, with four chutes and measuring over a quarter-mile long. Showers and locker rooms are available and there's plenty of room for sunbathing. There's also a pool concession area. Guests can buy tickets to the pool only, if desired, and by-pass the rides. Swim lessons are offered at the pool for season pass holders. Coney Island Park in Cincinnati is also home to 20 classic rides that are suitable for a variety of ages. Amusements include a classic steel coaster that appeals to all ages, an historic carousel, a free-fall ride, bumper cars, a Ferris wheel, Tilt-a-Whirl, Scrambler, a giant slide, and a few more modern rides. About a half-dozen rides are designed with the park's youngest visitors in mind. Coney Island also offers original, live stage shoes for guests to enjoy. The shows, usually the song-and-dance variety, are held several times each day in the Lakeside Pavilion. Other attractions include an arcade, a miniature golf course, a EuroBungy Dome (not included with standard admission), and a miniature recreation of a mining town. Coney Island Park is open from late May to early September. Patrons may purchase tickets for both the rides and the pool or just one or the other. An after-dusk combination ticket is also offered. There is a fee for onsite parking."

"Findlay Market in Cincinnati, Ohio an Excellent Shopping and Gathering Place","Ohio","Findlay Market in Cincinnati, Ohio an Excellent Shopping and Gathering Place","	Findlay Market in Cincinnati is the oldest continuously-operating public market in the state of Ohio. It is one of many that once served the people of the city. First founded in 1852, the market was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Located just north of the downtown area in an historic neighborhood known as Over-the-Rhine, renowned for its Italianate architecture, Findlay Market has always served as a gathering place for the people of the city of Cincinnati. More than a century ago, scores of individuals would head to the market daily to purchase the meat, poultry, produce, and any number of other items essential to life in the 19th century. The market building was designed by civil engineer Alfred West Gilbert, using a frame of wrought and cast iron, a building technique rarely used in the U.S. at that time. The market was originally an open-sided pavilion but health concerns in the early twentieth century prompted the enclosure of the entire market. The center masonry tower was added in 1902 as well and refrigeration and plumbing was added. The tower bell at Findlay Market came from Pearl Street Market, which was demolished in 1934. Renovations to the market occurred in the 1970s and again in the early years of the new millennium. Just as when it first opened, Findlay Market continues to attract patrons by the hundreds from all areas of the city and beyond. Open from Tuesday through Sunday, the Market House now holds about 4 dozen vendors who offer a variety of fare including meats, fish, poultry, cheese, pastas, herbs and spices, produce, chocolates, baked goods, and ready-made homemade foods. Some foods are from the nearby Amish and Mennonite neighborhoods that border Cincinnati and much is locally raised or grown. On the weekends from April through November, Findlay Market also hosts a small farmer's market-type operation, which includes the sale of plants, flowers, produce, eggs, baked goods, and soaps and lotions that are produced in the area. Also during the warmer months of late spring, summer, and early fall, the Findlay Market plays host to a number of entertainers. Most concerts take place on the weekends inside the Music in the Market tent at Findlay Market. Some concerts are scheduled for the colder weather in order to honor holidays such as Christmas, Valentine's Day, and Mardi Gras. Many of the performances benefit local charities. Visitors to Findlay Market should be sure to stop for a look at The Market Carpet, a beautiful eight by eight foot mosaic that tells the story of the market's first 100 years. Located in the center tower, it was designed by local artist David Day using brightly-colored porcelain tiles manufactured at Emaux de Briare, in Briare, France. Ample parking for patrons of Findlay Market is available in five parking lots that surround the marketplace. It is also easily reached by public transportation from various parts of the city."
"Fort Rapids Indoor Water Park in Columbus, Ohio a Fun Family Destination","Ohio","Fort Rapids Indoor Water Park in Columbus, Ohio a Fun Family Destination","	The Fort Rapids Indoor Water Park is situated inside the resort of the same name.

The resort and adjoining water park is especially popular with families traveling to the Columbus area and also attracts large numbers of groups, including scouts and youth groups from area houses of worship, who come to enjoy the facility for the day. The water park at Fort Rapids is accessible both to resort guests and to day visitors who just wish to pay for a few hours at the park.

The square, which is located at the corner of Fifth and Vine Streets, was once the location of an outdoor butcher's market. The centerpiece of Fountain Square is indeed a fountain, known as the Tyler Davidson Fountain. This lovely piece of art was a gift to the city from Cincinnati businessman Henry Probasco in memory of his brother-in-law and business partner. The fountain was purchased by Probasco from the Royal Bronze Foundry of Bavaria in Germany. Its design is by August von Kreling and Ferdinard von Miller and it was created to rival the great fountains usually found in the cities of Europe. The fountain was designed to glorify the genius of water'' and features four figures of animals that formerly served as drinking fountains. Atop the 43-foot fountain is a nine-foot-tall woman, cast in bronze, from whose hands flow streams of water. Tyler Davidson Fountain was renovated in 2005. At that same time, other portions of the square were renovated in order to attract more visitors to the area. Revitalization continues on several buildings on Fountain Square and new landscaping and lighting has made the area around the square more inviting. Currently, visitors to the area can enjoy such amenities as caf, tables with chess and checkers boards printed atop them, and a full-size ice rink that rivals the famous one located at New York's Rockefeller Center. Open seasonally, the rink offers skate rentals, lockers, and a heated tent with vending area. It's one of the most popular attractions along Fountain Square. For those who'd like to work outdoors in the square's pretty setting, free wi-fi is offered via three rooftop towers that surround Fountain Square.

The Lake/River Course is a Pete Dye design that features his typical penchant for water hazards and bunkers. The course, which opened in 1971, plays to 7,025 yards from the longest (Gold) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.7 and a slope rating of 136 on Bent grass. Another noteworthy element of the course is its greens, which have been said to roll no faster than the local municipal course, yet can confound players with their subtle slopes and undulations. Even when striking the ball well, high scores are still very possible on this course, thanks to added putting strokes. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4 on the Lake course. Nicknamed Coastline,'' this 438-yard par-4 has been consistently rated as one of Ohio's most difficult and diabolical par-4s. This signature hole tracks a lake from tee to green, and the water hazard has been described as larger than life.'' Playing close to the water on the right shortens the hole, but also increases the risk as the fairway and green curve around the water like a reverse question mark. Hole No. 9 on the Lake course is another distinctive par-4 that plays to only 388 yards from the back tees. The fairway on the hole named Decision'' is split by a vertical water hazard, however, which not only calls for a decision off the tee, but can often separate golf partners who end up on opposite sides of the creek. Playing to the left half of the fairway is the safer play, while the riskier play to the right provides a better angle for an approach to the green that takes the creek out of play on the second shot. Hole No. 12 is nicknamed Chagrin,'' and is another short par-4 at only 350 yards from the back tees. Once again, golfers find themselves with a choice off the tee as the fairway is split with a vertical water hazard. The left side is a common choice, but brings into play a large, solitary tree just left of the creek. As players approach the green, they'll find the water hazard wrapping around it in a figure-C layout that has claimed many a golf ball around a heart-shaped green. Hole No. 15 is another par-4 that plays to 429 yards from the back tees. While there's no water on this hole, golfers must contend with a cavernous valley that runs along the left of a narrow, deep green. Practice facilities at Fowler's Mill include a driving range and short-game area. There's also a well-stock Golf Shop and a Western Reserve-style clubhouse with a Grille room for casual dining. The clubhouse also features the Pete Dye room, which provides an upscale setting for banquets, meetings and wedding receptions."

This 88-acre facility is home to hundreds of plant and tree species, arranged in attractive outdoor gardens or located within the facility's expansive conservatory building, the architectural centerpiece of the attraction. It is the mission of Franklin Park Conservatory to promote environmental appreciation and ecological awareness for everyone. Our unique botanical collections provide lifelong learning opportunities in a friendly and accessible setting, which preserves tradition and provides a refuge for the soul.'' Sitting on the land that was once the site of the Ohio State Fair, the Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden was officially established in 1895. It was built around a grand Victorian-style conservatory/greenhouse, which was modeled after the Glass House from the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and Columbian Exposition. That glass structure, now the Palm House, would eventually be listed in 1974 on the National Register of Historic Places. For the first few decades, the conservatory housed animals as well as plants, but they were moved when the local zoo opened in 1929. Through the 20th century, Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden enjoyed moderate success but was thrust into the limelight in 1992 when it hosted AmeriFlora, an international exhibition. On the heels of this event, the directors decided to add a seasonal butterfly exhibition in 1994 and, in 2003, hosted an exhibit of works by famed glass artist Dale Chihuly and then purchased the entire exhibit, making this conservatory the only one in the world to have a collection of Chihuly works. The Chihuly collection attracts hundreds of visitors each year. Guests still come mainly to view the flowers, plants, and trees, however. The Entry Plaza is home to a variety of colorful species that vary with the season, including a holiday showcase and winter interest garden in the colder months. The Bride's Garden, added in August 2008, uses white as a unifying color and includes fountains, detailed stonework, winding paths, and trees with heart-shaped flowers. The Cascades Garden includes beautiful waterfalls, native perennials, and a variety of small wildlife, meant to be an oasis in the middle of the busy city. Inside the Palm House, visitors will find 43 species of palms from throughout the world, many that are endangered. The North Conservatory consists of three different biomes. The Himalayan Mountain Biome includes species found in a temperate mountain climate of about 9,000 feet above sea level; the Tropical Rainforest Biome is indicative of eco-systems located along the equator in Asia, Africa, and South America; and the Desert Biome includes plants that can survive in sparse rainfall. The South Conservatory houses the Pacific Island Biome, which represents the eco-system of a volcanically-formed island. Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden also hosts about a half-dozen special exhibitions each year and sponsors a number of educational programs for the general public. Classes for adults include garden walks, bonsai growing, art classes, lectures, and gardening programs. Family programs feature hands-on activities for ages 5 and up. Summer week-long camps are also offered for children up to grade 8. The Franklin Park Conservatory and Botanical Garden is open year round from Tuesday through Sunday and on particular Monday holidays. Guided and cell phone tours are available and there is a caf, and gift shop on the premises."
"German Village in Columbus","Ohio","German Village in Columbus, Ohio is a Thriving, Historic Community","	A downtown Columbus, Ohio neighborhood that is known as one of the premiere historic districts in the country, German Village is a lovingly restored community, the largest privately funded historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Comprised of 233 acres, if functions not only as a home for many and a vibrant shopping and dining area, but also as a sort of living history museum. German Village is located on a tract of land that was first appropriated to Canadians who had assisted the U.S. in the causes of the American Revolution. The first owner of the land was Nova Scotia native John McGowan, who both lived on the land and sold parcels to many newly-arriving German immigrants, thus the neighborhood's eventual moniker. These immigrants began arriving in 1930, mostly from the southern portion of Germany. The Germans built homes and businesses and established churches in this portion of the city. They also formed many cultural and social organizations and began assuming political offices. Though most German-Americans served in World War I, much animosity towards those who settled in this neighborhood occurred during this time and into World War II. Street names were changed and German books and newspapers were burned. The Great Depression also took its toll on the neighborhood and decline was evident by the 1950s. However, an interested German-American purchased a home there in 1959 and started a movement to restore the German Village area.

"Kelton House Museum and Gardens in Columbus, Ohio Preserves Local History","Ohio","Kelton House Museum and Gardens in Columbus, Ohio Preserves Local History","	Located in Columbus, Ohio's Discovery District, the mission of the Kelton House Museum and Gardens is to promote an understanding of daily life, customs, and decorative arts in 19th century Columbus and to educate visitors about the Underground Railroad. The home, built in 1852, was once the property of Fernando Cortez Kelton, a wealthy dry goods wholesaler and prominent Columbus citizen, and his wife, Sophia. The Keltons were staunch abolitionists who were eager to open their home to escaped slaves as a stop of the so-called Underground Railroad. The Keltons raised at least one slave as a member of their own family and were dedicated to the cause of freedom for slaves throughout their lifetime. It is said that Mr. Kelton was so well-known for his support of the abolition of slavery that he was asked to be a pall bearer for President Lincoln when his casket came through Columbus. The home remained in the Kelton family until 1975 when the last remaining Kelton granddaughter, Grace Bird Kelton, passed away. Ownership of the house and gardens was then passed on to the Junior League of Columbus, which turned it into a museum, restoring to represent a time period between 1850 and 1900. Grace Kelton had left it to the Junior League with stipulations that it be preserved and used for educational purposes. Currently, Kelton House is the only house museum in the city of Columbus. Inside, it's full of beautiful Victoriana - furnishings, silver, artwork, and other items from the Victorian period. An estimated 80% to 90% of the furniture in the home once belonged to the Kelton family. Daily tours are led by trained volunteer docents who can educate visitors in the particulars of life and the decorative arts during the Victorian era. Kelton House Garden is also a joy to explore. Restored to Grace Kelton's design, the garden reflects both Ms. Kelton's personal tastes and Victorian influences in gardening such as hedges, statuary, latticework, and perennial borders. Crab apple trees line the walkway and the garden is abloom with wild flowers, azaleas, rhododendron, and other popular flowering plants. Many of the sculptural pieces in the garden came from Kelton family trips to Europe and Asia. Special experiential'' tours are also available at Kelton House Museum and Gardens. Costumed actors portray Sophia Kelton and the slaves she rescued. Sophia will share information about the Kelton's life as abolitionists and how they became involved with the Underground Railroad. Guests can also enjoy Tea with Sophia,'' which includes an afternoon guided tour and refreshments. Kelton House Museum and Gardens is also available for rent for special occasions. The garden is an ideal place for an outdoor wedding ceremony and reception and the museum can accommodate 100 to 150 guests for a cocktail reception or sit-down dinner. The museum and gardens is open every Sunday afternoon for tours or on other days by special request."

"Longaberger Golf Club","Ohio","Longaberger Golf Club, Nashport, Ohio - Ranked the #1 Public Golf Course in Ohio in 2008 by Golfweek Magazine","Longaberger Golf Club is an Arthur Hills design that plays through some of the hilliest terrain the state of Ohio has to offer, with holes routed up and down every slope on the property. That provides for some steep elevation changes, picturesque views, but surprisingly few blind shots. The course, which opened in 1998, has the Arthur Hills design trademarks, which are more about sensible, enjoyable golf than over-the-top tricks and penalizing hazards. As such, an Arthur Hills' design is more traditional golf that allows the player a wider variety of options and strategies, rather than the course dictating numerous forced carries and dot-to-dot target golf. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,243 yards from the longest (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 75.0 and a slope rating of 140. From the Blue tees, the course plays to a very manageable 6,498 yards. However, wind can also be a huge factor on this course as the last 12 holes are more exposed. A calm'' day in southeast Ohio can alter club selection by 1-2 clubs, while a windy day can offer an even more severe challenge. The par-5 and par-4 holes at Longaberger tend to feature wide-open fairways, leaving strategy and shot shape up to the individual player. However, that can be a deceiving feature of the course, as green complexes are often contoured to favor an approach from one side of the fairway or the other, and golfers new to the course may only discover that once they reach the green. The par-3 holes on the course tend to be quite diverse, with No. 5 playing to 188 yards across a large gorge to a plateau green. Hole No. 9 plays shorter and over a pond to a sloped green shaped like a peanut, while Hole No. 12 plays to 181 yards and is set against the backdrop of another gorge. Like many courses, the par-4 holes at Longaberger tend to be the strongest and the most diverse. Hole No. 6, for example is short at 361 yards, but plays uphill, while Hole No. 13 plays to a lengthy 461 yards and Hole No. 18 is lengthy at 454 yards and also plays uphill. One of the most noteworthy holes on the course is Hole No. 4. This par-5 plays to 565 yards from the back tees, and features an elevation drop of 150 feet from the tee to the green, showcasing some of the area's rolling hills and panoramic views. Longaberger has received its share of accolades over the years, including being ranked by Golfweek Magazine as the #1 Public Golf Course in Ohio in 2008, and the #4 Public Golf Course in the Country in Golf World's 2008 Reader's Choice Awards. Practice facilities at Longaberger include a 25-acre grass driving range with target greens, as well as short-game area with greens and a bunker. The course also has a spacious, 60,000-square-foot clubhouse that is home to the Longaberger Golf Club Restaurant, which features informal cuisine. Stay & Play Packages are also available, in conjunction with The Place Off The Square hotel in Newark, Ohio."

The venue is located five blocks west of the Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati Ohio, and only a block away from the Ohio River. Rather than taking the route of a number of other teams in the league by selling the naming rights to an outside company, the stadium is instead named after Pro Football Hall of Fame member and former Coach, Paul Brown, founder of the Bengals as well as the Cleveland Browns. Opening August 19, 2000, the opening game was played between the Bengals and their rivals, the Cleveland Browns.

"Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio is a Worthwhile Family Stop","Ohio","Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio is a Worthwhile Family Stop","	A unit of the National Park Service, Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio commemorates the Battle of Lake Erie fought during the War of 1812. The memorial was established by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936. In 1966, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The site was re-designated as a National Memorial in 1972 and was also re-named at that time. It is the only peace memorial located within the United States National Park system. The memorial sits in the village of Put-in-Bay, not far from South Bass Island, part of the Lake Erie Islands. It was near this spot that, on Sept. 10, 1813, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry enjoyed the greatest naval victory of the War of 1812. The battle he won here secured control of Lake Erie for the U.S. and allowed General William Henry Harrison to stage a successful invasion of Western Upper Canada. It is believed that Perry's victory gave the United States more bargaining power at the peace talks that would end the war a year and a half later. The actual memorial was constructed between 1912 and 1915 and erected shortly thereafter, but it did not become a unit of the National Park System until more than two decades later. The goal of the memorial, aside from commemorating the naval victory, was to inculcate the lessons of international peace by arbitration and disarmament.'' The Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial is a Doric column that stands 352 feet tall and, by all accounts, is the most dominant feature in the Lake Erie Islands. The remains of three American and three British soldiers who were killed during the battle are interred beneath the rotunda floor. The names of all Americans who died or were wounded in the Battle of Lake Erie are carved in the rotunda walls as are the names of Perry's vessels. An observation deck that sits more than 317 feet in the air provides excellent views of not only the lake but also the shorelines of Ohio, Michigan, and Ontario, Canada. Access to the observation level is by elevator and an additional 37 stairs. Those who can't climb can see the view via a real-time monitor located at the elevator level. For guests who visit on weekends, there is an opportunity to view living history demonstrations by costumed park rangers including talks about the War of 1812, uniform demonstrations, and weapons demonstrations focusing on the artillery of that time period. Cannons are fired on certain pre-scheduled weekends. From Thanksgiving to the end of March, Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial is open only by prior appointment. During the remainder of the year, hours vary, with extended hours offered between Memorial Day and Labor Day. * Note - Because of some structural problems that have surfaced, including falling granite, this monument will close in August 2009 and is scheduled to remain closed for about 2 years until repairs are complete."
"Playhouse Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio Offers Theater and More","Ohio","Playhouse Square Center in Cleveland, Ohio Offers Theater and More","	Playhouse Square Center is a collection of theaters in Cleveland, Ohio's downtown area. It is the second-largest theater complex in the United States, surpassed only by New York City's Lincoln Center. The five theaters that make up Playhouse Square Center were constructed after World War I, between the months of February 1921 and November 1922. The builder, Marcus Loew, chose Euclid Avenue between East 14th and 17th Streets for the location of these opulent theaters. The Hanna Theater was located in the Hanna Building, but the other four theaters - Allen, Ohio, State, and Palace - were connected and sat across the street from the Hanna. In the early days of these Cleveland theaters, they were a venue for vaudeville, traditional plays and musicals, and silent films. During World War II, they became largely movie theaters. However, after the war, an exodus to the suburbs and the advent of television greatly affected theater attendance and by the late 1960s, the Allen, Ohio, State, and Palace had closed. The Hanna remained open until the mid 1980s. Like much of downtown Cleveland, the theaters suffered from neglect and vandalism until interested citizens stepped in to save them in the 1970s. A plan was devised for a large theater complex and the Playhouse Square Association was formed. The theaters were gradually renovated and re-opened one by one, beginning in the early 1980s. Each is now a profitable entity and the Playhouse Square Center complex is considered one of Cleveland's most successful urban renewal projects. Resident companies at the Playhouse Square Center include Opera Cleveland, DANCE Cleveland, Ohio Ballet, Great Lakes Theater Festival, Tri-C Cultural Arts Series, and Tri-C Jazz Festival. These companies provide a variety of performance opportunities all year long for patrons with various tastes, including classic and well as cutting-edge plays, Broadway-style musicals, dance troupes, concerts by a variety of artists of many genres, comedy presentations, and much more. Top-name performers have starred in concerts and productions at the five theaters of Playhouse Square Center and the complex continues to hone its reputation as an excellent performance venue. The Playhouse Square Center sponsors a number of special events and programs regularly, including the Discovery Theater Series for Families. The plays presented as part of this series are light-hearted and hold the attention of young theater goers, providing a good introduction for them to the world of theater. There's also a Discovery Theater Series for schools, with performances appropriate for children up to grade 8. Playhouse Square also offers summer Musical Theater Camps for teens age 14 to 19. Tickets may be purchased for individual events at the Playhouse Square Center and some events are available in a series, such as the Broadway musical productions that are performed there. Group reservations are available at reduced prices for most productions and concerts as well. Several spaces within Playhouse Square Center are available for rent and can accommodate up to 1,000 people."

"Pro-Football Hall Of Fame In Canton, Ohio","Ohio","Pro-Football Hall Of Fame In Canton, Ohio","For the diehard football fan, there is no other place on earth that represents and honors the history of the game, better than the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. The Pro Football Hall of Fame first opened in 1963 and had 17 charter inductees. Presently, the museum includes; game scores of players, coaches, football, super bowl and history of the game exhibits. Every year, devoted and adoring fans are drawn here in innumerable throngs.

The building is currently 82,000 square feet and has a total six exhibit areas. Its location in Canton, Ohio, is approximately a one hour drive, south of Cleveland. The location of Canton, Ohio was chosen because it was the original home of the American Professional Football Association, a forerunner of the National Football League (NFL). Among the first things you see when entering the building is a bronze statue to honor Jim Thorpe, the first star in professional football. He was a very versatile athlete, played American football, won Olympic gold medals, and also played baseball and basketball.  You walk through 100 years of football history, view information on over 200 inductees, see a complete collection of super bowl rings, and view a behind the scenes'' movie about team game-day preparation.

"Progressive Field in Cleveland, OH a Classic Ballpark","Ohio","Progressive Field in Cleveland, OH a Classic Ballpark","	Built in 1994, Progressive Field in Cleveland, OH, in Cuyahoga County, is the home of the Cleveland Indians American League franchise of Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously known as Jacobs Field, the stadium provided a new baseball-only home for the Indians, who used to share Cleveland Municipal Stadium with the National Football League Cleveland Browns. The stadium was financed by the voters of Cuyahoga County by means of 15-year sin tax'' on alcohol and cigarette sales, approved in May 1990. A ceremonial first pitch'' was thrown in 1992 before construction began but the real first pitch at the new Jacobs Field occurred on April 4, 1994. Jacobs Field, named for team owners David and Richard Jacobs, is still affectionately known as The Jake'' by many locals even though the name was changed to Progressive Field on opening day of the 2008 season. Progressive Insurance Company, headquartered in nearby Mayfield Village, purchased the naming rights of the stadium until 2024 at a cost of $57.6 million. Progressive Field is touted as a classic urban stadium, built within the physical boundaries of three streets in the middle of downtown Cleveland. The original seating capacity of the stadium was about 42,000 but with the addition of two new sections at the end of the bleacher sections in 1997, capacity topped out at 43,345. Wider aisles were designed for more leg room and some seating sections are angled so as to give fans an optimal view of the game. Premium club seating is available for those who wish to purchase upgraded seating and enjoy Progressive Field's posh air-conditioned Club Lounge, which offers a dining and bar area and flat screen televisions for viewing the game. Suites are also available for business clients. Fans may also purchase membership in the stadium's Terrace Club, which includes a number of benefits including guest passes, priority reservation opportunities, access to the Terrace Club Bar, and free room rental for non-game day catering events held in the Terrace Club. When Progressive Field's scoreboard was installed during construction, it was the largest in the country. Upgrades in electronics prompted the replacement of the scoreboard in 2004 with a new state-of-the-art Daktronics board with a video display that measures 149 feet long and 36 feet high. This is the largest video display in the world at a sports venue. In 2007, the Cleveland Indians franchise decided to add a section to the stadium that would be known as Heritage Park. This section would be home to the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame and include names and photos of the 100 greatest Cleveland Indians players, synopses of memorial Indian moments, and a memorial plaque to Ray Chapman, an early Indian who spent his whole career with the Indians, dying in 1920 when he was struck with an errant pitch thrown by Yankee Carl Mays. Heritage Park is located behind the center field wall."

"Quicken Loans Arena","Ohio","Quicken Loans Arena, Cleveland, Ohio","The land Quicken Loans Arena or QLA stands on in Cleveland, Ohio has a very long history. In the 1800's the land was used as Clevelands Central Market Place. Unfortunately the market was destroyed in the 1940's by a fire and little was done to revamp the area, until 1984. In 1984 a plan to construct an arena was created. Unfortunately the vote to the community did not pass. By 1990 permission had been granted finally for the land to contain a stadium. Quicken Loans Arena has made a name for itself as a sports and entertainment facility. It has a contemporary design with many state of the art options. The Ellerbe Becket Architectural Firm from Kansas City had a huge influence on the construction and design of the arena. P. Madison International also helped in the design. Both companies wanted a cookie cutter design with 108x48 feet of billboard activity. The roof line offers a unique structure in that the building rotates at 90 degrees. Ground breaking for the facility began in 1992 and the grand opening occurred in 1994. The first performer to open the arena was Billy Joel. Today the arena is home to the NBAA's Cleveland Cavaliers, AHL's Lake Erie Monsters, and the Mid- American Conference Men's and Women's Championships. The Lake Erie Monsters are new to the American Hockey League, having begun their team in the 2007- 2008 season. The monsters are actually an affiliate of the NHL's Colorado Avalanche team. Each year about 2 million people attend the 200 events offered by the facility. Seating capacity for the arena is 20,000 for most events. 60 percent of the seats are in the lower bowl of the arena. There is a 28 foot high scoreboard with LED lights, a scoring matrix, and display. It uses SmartVision for the screens. Each of the screens is 8' by 21.5' and are all digital. The screens are angled for the best viewing throughout the entire arena. Quicken Loans Arena has several full service club rooms and 565 television monitors throughout the concourses for viewing during breaks and the game. Quaker Steak and Lube are the two full service restaurants offered at QLA, with plenty of concessions spread throughout the facility. The concessions include hot dogs, pizza, popcorn, and much more. The Cavaliers have a retail space measuring 2,600 square feet for souvenirs associated with the home teams. At Quicken Loans Arena the Ringling Circus, Scott Hamilton, Bruce Springsteen, Miley Cyrus, Star Wars in Concert, Trans- Siberian Orchestra, Disney on Ice, Basketball, Hockey, and other events will be held this year.

"Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Ohio a Treat for Music Lovers","Ohio","Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Ohio a Treat for Music Lovers","	Situated on the shores of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a mecca for lovers of the rock genre and a fun and educational venue for all ages. Part of the redeveloped North Coast Harbor area, the museum is housed in a spectacular I.M Pei-designed building featuring a tower and a glittering glass pyramid protruding from its top. Opened in 1995, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum was in the planning stages for more than a dozen years prior to that time. Several cities were considered for the honor, including New York and Memphis. However, Cleveland was chosen because it was the location of disc jockey Alan Freed, who is credited with coining the term rock and roll'' and promoting the genre on the radio. Cleveland also presented museum founders with an attractive financial package that helped prompt the decision. This ultra-modern building consists of seven levels. 	The first five levels of the museum include permanent exhibits profiling the history of Rock and Roll in the United States and around the world. Specifically, one area looks at the roots of the genre and its connection to other styles of music including bluegrass, gospel, blues, and country. Another highlights the music scenes - past and present - of some of Rock and Roll's most important cities, including Detroit, New York, Memphis, and Liverpool (England). Other exhibits focus on the lives and work of particular artists who are legends in the Rock world including Les Paul, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley, Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Temporary exhibits are housed in the smaller top two floors of the museum. The museum owns tens of thousands of artifacts related to the genre and the collection continues to grow. Some have been donated by the artists themselves or by their families. Others come from private collections that have been donated or willed to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Many are on display. Items include Janis Joplin's 1965 Porsche, Chuck Berry's electric guitar, a Who drum head, several pieces of clothing from Fats Domino, and much, much more. Exhibits change on occasion so that more of the items can be visible to the public. The Hall of Fame portion of the museum is located on the third floor. Each year, performers and non-performers (record producers, disc jockeys, songwriters, concert promoters, etc.) are inducted into the Hall of Fame during a ceremony usually held in New York City. There are also early influences'' and sidemen'' categories as well as a Life Achievement section of the museum. About 5 inductees from each category are added each year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland is open 365 days a year with extended touring hours on Wednesday evenings. Group tours are available.

"Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati, Ohio is an Historic Landmark","Ohio","Roebling Suspension Bridge in Cincinnati, Ohio is an Historic Landmark","	The John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge is an historic bridge that spans the Ohio River between Cincinnati, Ohio and Covington, Kentucky. At the time of its construction, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world. The bridge is named for its architect, John Roebling, who was also responsible for the design of the famous Brooklyn Bridge. The two structures resemble one another. Plans for the bridge began in the 1840s, when it was decided that trade between Ohio and Kentucky could not continue without a permanent and sturdy form of transportation between the two states. Suspension bridges were new on the scene and had already been built over similar expanses. John A. Roebling was considered the premiere designer of these bridges. In 1846, Roebling came up with a design that included a 1,200 foot span with a 100-foot clearance. For several reasons, the building of the bridge was delayed. Ferry boaters feared an obstruction of the waterway and a suspension bridge collapse in Tennessee kept the Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company from raising enough money for the new project. However, the election in 1856 of a new, energetic trustee named Amos Shinkle brought new life to the project. Also, by this time, Roebling had gained an excellent reputation as a bridge architect. Digging for the foundation began later that year. By the time the Civil War began in 1860, only part of the bridge was complete. All work ceased during most of the war years, partially to avoid the escape of slaves who could have traveled across the bridge from Kentucky into the free North. Construction began again in spring 1864 and the bridge was almost complete by late 1866. A grand opening occurred on Dec. 1 of that year even though the last few finishing touches weren't done until July 1867. The final span measured 1,057 feet and was, at that time, the longest suspension bridge in the world. More than 166,000 people walked across on the first two days. A total of 10,361 wires were used in the construction of the Roebling Suspension Bridge and those wires were spun into two enormous cables. About 600,000 feet of oak lumber was laid across 300 wrought iron suspension beams. Today, the bridge still plays an important role in getting commuters from one state to the other. It is also popular with pedestrian traffic and is often used by patrons of Cincinnati's sports arenas who travel to Northern Kentucky on foot after the games to partake of the night life in the district at the foot of the bridge known as Roebling Point. The bridge was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1983. During that same year, the bridge's name was changed from the Cincinnati-Covington Suspension Bridge to the John A. Roebling Bridge in honor of its designer and builder."

"Shaker Run Golf Club, Lakeside/ Woodlands Course, Lebanon, Ohio ? An Arthur Hills Design and One of the Best Public Golf Courses in Ohio","Ohio","Shaker Run Golf Club, Lakeside/ Woodlands Course, Lebanon, Ohio ? An Arthur Hills Design and One of the Best Public Golf Courses in Ohio","Shaker Run Golf Club features 27 holes of golf between its Lakeside, Woodlands and Meadows nines. The original 18 holes - the Lakeside/Woodlands combination - is an Arthur Hills design that opened as a private course in 1979 but became a public, daily-fee course in 1994. The 18-hole, par-72 Lakeside/Woodlands course plays to 6,794 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74 and a slope rating of 138 on Poa Annua Grass. Like the name implies, the Lakeside nine has numerous water hazards, which come into play on seven of the nine holes, thanks to a 125-acre lake. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the Lakeside nine include No. 1, which makes for a difficult opening as the #2-handicap hole. This par-4 plays to 450 yards from the Black tees and 410 yards from the Blues. A good tee shot in the fairway or slightly to the left will leave players with an open approach shot through the trees to a kidney-shaped green that's guarded by a long bunker short and left of the green. Hole No. 2 is a short par-3 that plays only 135 yards from the Blue tees. From an elevated tee, players take aim at a green fronted by water. The wind can be a factor on this hole, as will the elevation change, but usually one less club is the recommended choice. Hole No. 8 has been called a great risk-reward par-5. The hole is not very long, playing to only 499 yards from the longest tees, and there's a generous landing area off the tee just past the trees. The second shot plays downhill, however, and approach shots must play to a partially blind green. Hole No. 9 on the Lakeside nine is the #1-handicap hole, a par-4 that plays to 380 yards from the Blue tees. From the tee players must contend with a water inlet and decide how much, if any, they want to cut the corner. Driver is probably not the option on this hole, however, as shots that go long will find approach shots from a difficult side-hill lie out of the rough. Some of the more noteworthy holes on the Woodlands nine include Hole No. 5, the signature hole for the course, a par-3 that plays 190 yards from the Blue tees. The hole plays downhill and requires a carry over a creek, however, making it arguably the toughest test of club selection that players are likely to encounter on the course. Shaker Run has received a number of accolades over the years, including being named the Best Public Course in the state of Ohio in 1996 by Golf Digest. The club has also played host to several tournaments, such as the 2005 U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship. Practice facilities at Shaker Run include a driving range, putting green and chipping area. Lessons are also available. Shaker Run also features a clubhouse that is home to the Shaker Run Bar and Grille, and also features a Grand Ballroom that can accommodate up to 325 guests, along with a fully enclosed tournament pavilion that can accommodate up to 150 guests."

"Short North Arts District in Columbus, Ohio is a Cultural Mecca","Ohio","Short North Arts District in Columbus, Ohio is a Cultural Mecca","	The Short North Arts District of Columbus, Ohio is an arts-oriented area located just north of downtown, centered on the main section of North High Street and stretching to just south of the University of Ohio campus. Though the area is generally known as a gay-oriented neighborhood, merchants in the area cater to people of all sexual orientations. In the early 1900s, the North High Street area was bustling with activity and was the location of many of the city's best merchants. However, North High Street was later replaced with Interstate 670 and the strip became a location for seedy commercial establishments and, eventually, slum housing. Those who had resided in the area for many years moved to the now trendy suburbs and left the area open to violence and drug dealing. Police, who were called to the area frequently, began to refer to the region between downtown and the University of Ohio as Short North and the moniker stuck, referring to the fact that the region was just short'' of the north end business district of Columbus. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, urban dwellers looking for inexpensive housing options close to the downtown area began to purchase dilapidated homes in the Short North district and painstakingly restored them to their original state or better. Some buildings became offices and others were eventually made into shops, restaurants, or night spots. In 2002, the city jumped on the urban renewal bandwagon and installed 17 lighted metal arches across High Street, reminiscent of ones that were there in the early 1900s when Columbus was know as the Arch City. In the 21st century, the Short North district has become best known as an arts mecca. Nearly all the buildings have been restored, though some have been demolished to make way for parking lots. There are still plenty of residential opportunities there, including not only old restored rowhomes but also newer condominiums and apartments. Many of the older buildings in the neighborhood now sport colorful murals, painted on their sides, indicative of the large number of artists that live and work in the Short North Arts District today. Weekends in the Short North Arts District are very busy as visitors arrive from all around the city and beyond to shop in the neighborhood's many galleries and unique shops. Each Saturday, the district sponsors what has become known as a Gallery Hop. During these events, galleries open their doors until the late evening hours and street musicians and other performers entertain the crowds of patrons all day long. Other shops and restaurants offer a variety of specials to coincide with Gallery Hop dates as well. Other special events are frequent in the Short North Arts District. They include the annual Doo Dah Parade, a parody on the typical all-American Fourth of July parade, featuring bands of unusual characters and floats with crazy and sometimes questionable themes. The Short North Arts District is easy to reach from the University of Ohio and from the Columbus Convention Center and Nationwide Arena. Several city bus routes also make a stop at the Short North neighborhood."

"Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens in Akron, Ohio a Feast for the Eyes","Ohio","Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens in Akron, Ohio a Feast for the Eyes","	Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens is a country estate and botanical garden located in Akron, Ohio and opened to the general public for tours. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, it is a popular Akron area tourist attraction. The words Stan Hywet'' do not refer to a person; rather, the words mean stone quarry'' in Olde English. The estate was originally built for the founder of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, F.A. Seiberling. He chose the name because of site was once occupied by an old stone quarry. Built between 1912 and 1915 and designed by architect Charles Sumner Schneider, the massive estate is fashioned in Tudor Revival style. Hugo F. Huber, a popular interior designer of the era, was responsible for choosing the furnishings, most of which came from high-priced stores in New York City or London. Landscape architect Warren Manning was responsible for the design of the gardens, which were inspired by the natural topography of the property. He worked closely with Schneider to see that the gardens and estate complemented each other. Schneider designed several overlooks where the owners could enjoy views of the garden and the surrounding valley and lagoon. The gardens were redesigned in 1929 to include a classic English garden, designed by renowned landscaper architect Ellen Biddle Shipman. Today, Stan Hywet Hall is considered one of the most outstanding examples of Tudor Revival architecture in the United States and visitors can enjoy the views both inside and out. While the architecture is stunning, the interior of the estate is also worth a visit, especially to view the amazing collection of art work inside as well as the beautiful architectural details. The house includes 21,000 panes of glass, 23 fireplaces, and a host of hand-carved wood features. The music room includes a beautiful 1916-built Aeolian pipe organ that was used to entertain guests in the early days of the mansion. The gardens at Stan Hywet Hall originally measured some 1,000 acres but now include only about 70. A wonderful place to take photos, the gardens are divided into several sections including the Birch Allee Vista, a beautiful stretch of 100 grey birches; the Breakfast Room Garden, which reflects the colors of the interior breakfast room; the Dell, a natural woodland garden; an English Garden with reflecting pool and statuary; the Grape Arbor, with a variety of fruit trees; the Great Garden, with a huge variety of flowerbeds; the Great Meadow, reminiscent of the lawns of great English Tudor estates; a traditional Japanese Garden; a beautiful lagoon surrounded by natural plantings; and the stunning West Terrace, visible from the Great Room of the estate. The Stan Hywet Hall and Gardens is open to the public year round from Tuesday through Sunday. Some extended evening hours are offered. Visitors may choose from guided house tours or a self-guided tour. Specialized tours are offered occasionally. A caf, is located on the premises, situated where the manor's horse stalls once sat."
"StoneWater Golf Club","Ohio","StoneWater Golf Club, Highland Heights, Ohio - Ranked As One of the Top 100 Golf Courses in the Country and the Best Public Course in Ohio by Golf Digest","StoneWater Golf Club is set amid 178 acres of wooded wetlands, with water hazards such as ponds, creeks and wetlands coming into play on nearly every hole, necessitating 23 wooden bridges on the course. Sandstone rock, which was quarried on site as the course was being built, is another signature element, lining ponds, creeks and tee boxes. The course, which was designed by Dana Fry of the Fry/Hurdzan Design Group and opened in 1996, plays to 7,045 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.8 and a slope rating of 138 on Bent grass. Another noteworthy feature of the course is its bunkering, with 71 sand bunkers including some of the largest and most dramatic hazards to be found. The greens tend to be large, while playing fast with frequent undulations. Some of the more noteworthy holes include Nos. 1, 2 and 3, which have been called the signature holes on the course. No. 1 is a par-4 that plays to 411 yards from the Gold tees and features a stream that crosses the fairway right about where tee shots land. No. 2 is another par-4 that plays to a hefty 445 yards from the back tees, and 414 yards from the Whites. The challenge on this hole is found in its fairway bunkers and the greenside bunkers that protect both sides of the putting surface. No. 3 is a par-3 that plays to 201 yards. This hole calls for a forced carry over water to a green guarded by sand and a stonewalled marsh. Hole No. 7 has been described as an exciting par-4.'' The hole only plays to 332 yards from the White tees, but plays around the largest water hazard on the course. There's a fairly sizable landing area that's almost an island, and from there golfers must take aim at a green that pushes out into the water. On the back nine, Hole No. 13 is a brute. This par-5 plays to 626 yards from the tips and features two wetlands that jut from the rough into the fairway playing area. Trees also line both sides of this hole, adding to the considerable challenge. StoneWater has received a number of accolades over the years, including being ranked as the 40th-best Public Golf Course in the country in 2003 and the best public golf course in Ohio by Golf Digest. StoneWater Golf Club features a spacious practice area, and lessons are available via The Academy of Golf at StoneWater Golf Club, which offers the same amenities as a nationally ranked school. The course also features a clubhouse with a spacious locker room and the StoneWater Grill for elegant dining."
"The American Sign Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio Provides a Quirky Look at U.S. History","Ohio","The American Sign Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio Provides a Quirky Look at U.S. History","	The only public sign museum in the nation, the American Sign Museum in Cincinnati, Ohio takes visitors on a tour of 100 years of American signage, from simple posters to spectacular examples of the use of neon. A non-profit corporation, the American Sign Museum began not with a collection but with an idea forged by Tod Swormstedt, former editor and publisher of Sign of the Times Magazine, a leading magazine for those in the sign industry. With support of the magazine's publishing company, the museum opened in spring 2005 and now boasts more than 3,000 catalogued items. Donations and new additions are made regularly. The museum, with a mission to inform and educate the general public, as well as business and special interest groups, about the history of the sign industry and its significant contribution to commerce and the American landscape, is currently housed in a 42,000 square-foot facility in Cincinnati's Camp Washington neighborhood, having outgrown its first location in Walnut Hills. Twenty-eight foot ceilings provide plenty of room for displays of extra large signage. For visitors, especially those who have a fondness for Americana, the American Sign Museum is truly fascinating and brings back grand memories of days gone by, when billboards and other kinds of signs were the main source of advertising for most companies. The signs on display are divided into eight categories: Gold Leaf Glass Signs, which includes gilded signs from the early 19th century; Pre-Neon Electric Signs from the era of signs that used standard light bulbs to illuminate their message; Painted Non-Illuminated Signs, some dating back to the late 19th century; two collections of Neon Signs and Displays, one profiling the 20s and 30s and another highlighting such signs from the 40s and 50s; Plastic Signs of the post-World War II era; Sign Shop Signs that span the last century; and Miscellaneous Signs and Displays including such popular icons as the Bob's Big Boy figure and the original Holiday Inn sign. In addition, visitors can view a photo collection of more than 1,200 objects that are not currently on display, many of them from private donors. Another display, dubbed The Art of the Sales Proposal'', highlights sketches and 3-D models of signs which acted as proposals for creators that were hoping to sell their designs to particular companies or businesses. The American Sign Museum is offered for rent for parties, receptions, meetings, and other special occasions and makes a unique and educational location for these events. The museum can accommodate a DJ, plenty of seating, and even provides an outdoor grilling area during the summer. Rates are charged per 5 hour time slot. The museum has already been the site of numerous wedding ceremonies. Currently, the museum has limited hours and is only open on Saturdays throughout the year. Special fundraising events that support the museum are held several times each year, including silent auctions and adopt-a-sign programs. As more individuals volunteer to be docents, the museum hopes to extend its hours."
"The Arena District Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio Offers the Best of Urban Life","Ohio","The Arena District Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio Offers the Best of Urban Life","	The Arena District Neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio is a mixed-use neighborhood of housing, retail establishments, offices, and entertainment. The catalyst for the development of the neighborhood was the 20,000-seat Nationwide Arena, opened in 2000. The building of the arena district was part of a joint partnership between the city of Columbus and the Nationwide Realty Investors Group. Upon its creation, the neighborhood strived to embody three theories of urban development - walkable street and neighborhood design, an urban setting where young professionals can combine work and play, and sports venues. The Arena District indeed has all three. The neighborhood began with the construction of 525 housing units but another 450 are planned for the final phase of the development. More office space and retail areas are also planned as is a large parking structure to accommodate the growing crowds that frequent the neighborhood. There are also plans for an expansive grocery store to serve area residents, and a baseball stadium for the AAA Columbus Clippers. Currently, the area enjoys the highest rates in the city for office and retail space. For those who wish to live in the area, apartments are available for rent or condos may be purchased at one of two developments within the Arena District Neighborhood. Prices are quite steep because of the central Columbus location of the neighborhood and its proximity to the busy downtown area and its many offices and entertainment venues. Dining and entertainment options within the Arena District are many and varied. Restaurants currently number about 20 and range from fast food to pizza to establishments serving fine cuisine with table service. A number of eateries also offer live entertainment several evenings per week, making the district an ideal nightspot and a great place to linger after enjoying a concert or sporting event at the Nationwide Arena. In addition to the arena, the neighborhood is also home to the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion, a unique facility with a reversion stage that converts the pavilion from indoor venue to outdoor amphitheater. That means concerts or other events scheduled for outdoors can continue rain or shine. The amphitheater can seat 4,500 patrons in chairs or on its expansive lawn, where patrons can set up their own chairs and bring a picnic to enjoy during the event. Also in the district are a movie theater, an athletic club, and an ice skating rink. The latter is the practice rink for the NHL Columbus Blue Jackets, who play at the Nationwide Arena. It's also used quite often as a practice area for other visiting NHL teams. For visitors planning to stay in the Arena District neighborhood, there are three hotels from which to choose that are within walking distance of the arena itself and many of the offices and businesses in the neighborhood. These include the 384-room Crowne Plaza Hotel, which offers lots of meeting space; the Hyatt Regency, which has a direct connection to the Greater Columbus Convention Center; and The Lofts, dubbed a New York-style hotel with 44 rooms, located in the historic Carr Building, which was built in 1882."

The idea for the museum was proposed in the late 1870s with the organization of the Women's Art Association of Cincinnati. A few years later, the Cincinnati Museum Association was incorporated and plans for a purpose-built art museum emerged. This would be the first such museum west of the Allegheny Mountains. It opened its doors in May 1886 and became known as The Art Palace of the West.'' The museum collection grew quickly and additions to the attractive Romanesque Revival building, designed by architect James McLaughlin, were being made by 1907. More additions came in the 1930s and the 40s and 50s ushered in a period of renovation for the Cincinnati Art Museum. More space was added in 1965, 1993, and 2003.

"The Flats Neighborhood in Cleveland Ohio is an Historic Entertainment District","Ohio","The Flats Neighborhood in Cleveland Ohio is an Historic Entertainment District","	The Flats Neighborhood of Cleveland is an area of the city located along the Cuyahoga River, dissected by the river to form two distinct areas - the East Bank and the West Bank. This low-lying neighborhood got its name from its flat appearance. The Flats has a long history and was first settled by one of Cleveland's earliest residents, Lorenzo Carter. This region of the city was a difficult place to live as the humidity was high, the water bred insects and disease, and the winters were harsh, with strong winds generated by Lake Erie. But when the Ohio and Erie Canal was completed in 1927, the area enjoyed a resurgence of business because shipping on Lake Cuyahoga increased and the Flats region provided plenty of room for docks and warehouses. At that time, The Flats also saw an increase in its residential population as a large contingency of Irish immigrants hired to construct the canal made their homes on the West Bank, The coming of the railroads in the 1850s spurred yet another increase in activity in The Flats neighborhood, which continued to provide lots of space for storage and the handling of freight. A bridge was finally built to join the two sides of the area known as The Flats. By the end of the 19th century, the East Bank was known for its seedy establishments, unfortunately, and the West for its industry. As time went on, industry in the area grew to include many steel mills, lumberyards, flour mills, shipyards, oil refineries, paint and chemical factories, and iron furnaces. This was good for the area until around the 1970s, when the large mills saw substantial losses in business and eventually closed. The Flats became quite unsavory and crime ridden as industries moved out of the area. From the mid 80s into the 90s, attempts at making the Flats an important Cleveland entertainment district were semi-successful. Through those years, visitors could travel to this neighborhood to visit nightclubs, comedy establishments, and much more. However, the drowning of three drunken patrons in the Cuyahoga River in 2000 put a damper on the area's entertainment reputation and businesses began to close, particularly on the East Bank. Today, most of the East Bank restaurants, clubs, and other venues remain dark and that half of The Flats has earned a rather poor reputation. Attempts are being made to buy up existing warehouses and other buildings on the east side and turn them into a mixed-use development that would reinvigorate the area on this side of the river. The West Bank, however, still boasts a number of good night spots and eateries and remains a popular place for the younger crowed to visit on weekends. The west side of the river is also home to a number of new shopping areas, including the expansive and attractively-built Steelyard Commons, and also a few upscale condominium developments. The water quality of the area, which was always a concern due to the massive amount of industry there, has improved lately as well."

"The Krohn Conservatory in Cincinnati is a Favorite with Nature Lovers","Ohio","The Krohn Conservatory in Cincinnati is a Favorite with Nature Lovers","	 Located in Cincinnati and managed by the city's Department of Parks, the Krohn Conservatory in Eden Park is a year round attraction for those who have a keen interest in plants and in horticulture in general. The first greenhouses were built in Eden Park in the 1880s, designed strictly for growing plants for the park. However, in 1902, the park system decided to open a new greenhouse for public viewing. The plants inside were changed regularly and the greenhouse obtained a regular following of visitors. In 1930, the park commission voted to replace the old greenhouses with a new conservatory, a modern facility the likes of which were springing up all around the country. This new building was to be designed in the Art Deco style of architecture that was so popular in the 20s and 30s and would be made of aluminum and glass. Dubbed simply The Eden Park Conservatory'', it opened to the public in 1933. Four years later, the name was changed to honor Irwin Krohn's 25 years of service on the Board of Park Commissioners. Since that time, the conservatory building has been enlarged on numerous occasions to make room for additional displays. Today, it is home to more than 1,000 different species of plants in several permanent display areas. The Palm House consists of a large variety of palm trees as well as hundreds of vines and a beautiful 20 foot-high waterfall. The popular Tropical House depicts the plant life of a tropical rain forest and includes ferns and other trees and plants that survive in the rain forest ecosystem, including vanilla plants, cocoa trees, and guava. The Krohn Conservatory's beautiful Floral Display House boasts a fragrant collection of citrus trees as well as space for changing seasonal exhibits, including holiday plants during the month of December. The Desert House includes cacti, succulents, and a variety of blooming desert plants. In 1995, a Bonsai Garden was added, sponsored by the Bonsai Society of Greater Cincinnati. It includes hundreds of tiny trees that fascinate visitors. Finally, the Orchid House, also added in the 1990s, is home to a huge variety of this perennial epiphyte. In addition to the permanent displays, the Krohn Conservatory is home to an occasional temporary exhibit and some special holiday displays as well, including the annual Educational Christmas Tree, which is decorated with ornaments made of natural materials all made by Conservatory horticulturists. Krohn also sponsors five annual flower shows and a yearly Butterfly Show, which takes place each spring. Guests can even enjoy happy hour or breakfast with the butterflies as they fly freely through a section of the conservatory.

"The Oregon District of Dayton, Ohio is Full of History","Ohio","The Oregon District of Dayton, Ohio is Full of History","	Located between Patterson Blvd. and Wayne Ave. North to Gates St. and South to U.S. 35, the historic Oregon District of Dayton, Ohio represents the city's oldest surviving intact combination of notable residential and commercial architecture. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, it comprises about a 40 square-block area of the city. The neighborhood was first established in 1829 when the Miami Canal opened and industrial development came to the area. Many of the early settlers of Oregon were Germans who came to work in the city's factories. The name Oregon appeared as early as 1845 though the origins of the moniker are unknown. Many early local merchants used the word Oregon'' in the names of their businesses and there is evidence that there was an Oregon Fire Company as early as 1850. During the second half of the 19th century, the Oregon District earned a reputation as a fine place to live. The city's wealthiest merchants put down roots there and built some of the largest and most ornate homes the city would ever see and the neighborhood is still considered the most architecturally-significant area of the city. Mansions are commonplace and can be found in a variety of styles that were popular during that era. These include Federal, Italianate, Greek Revival, and Queen Anne. However, when the Great Flood of 1913 hit Dayton, it began to experience a serious decline and neighborhoods like the Oregon District were greatly affected. Urban blight was evident by as early as the 40s and 50s. In the 1960s, the city began an urban clearance and redevelopment program in an attempt to save Dayton. Locals recognized the architectural gem that was the Oregon District and a fight to save the area was mounted and was successful. The homes that were saved during the regentrification remain a sign of the early success of the city and though most are now privately owned, they are still a tourist site for visitors and many can be toured at least once a year. However, visitors head to the historic Oregon District not only to admire the elaborate homes and old office buildings there, but also to enjoy the shopping and entertainment that has sprung up throughout this attractive neighborhood. Some of the city's most highly acclaimed restaurants are located in the Oregon District and on the weekends, the area is crowded with diners. Visitors will find everything here from pizza take-out to elegant fine-dining establishments with table service. Bars and nightspots are also commonplace and are especially enjoyed by young professionals, many of whom have taken up residence in the area. Shopping is popular here as well. There are a handful of antique stores located throughout the neighborhood as well as apparel, gift, and other kinds of shops. A charming city park, Newcom Founders Park, is a popular retreat for locals, established in 1985 as the focal point of the neighborhood. The gazebo in the center of the park has become a favorite place for weddings, and on a warm day, it's not unusual to see dozens of families enjoying an outdoor picnic in Newcom Founders Park."

"The Warehouse District in Cleveland, Ohio is Full of History","Ohio","The Warehouse District in Cleveland, Ohio is Full of History","	Bordered by Front Avenue, Superior Avenue, West 3rd Street, and West 10th Street, the Warehouse District is a neighborhood in downtown Cleveland. Placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, the history of the area includes both residential and industrial uses. Despite the moniker Warehouse District'', this portion of the downtown area was, in the early 19th century, originally the city's residential district. However, by the end of that century, it had become a wholesale commercial area, home to numerous warehousing and distribution terminals. It remained that way for nearly a century. Throughout the late 60s, 70s, and early 80s, the district fell into disrepair and became crime ridden. However, by the late 1980s, an urban renaissance program prompted by the city and some concerned citizens turned the Warehouse District into one of the trendiest neighborhoods in the city. Old warehouses became spacious restaurants and lively nightclubs and the area quickly became a hang-out for the young adult generation. Also in the 1980s, the Warehouse District began earning a reputation as an artists' enclave. Many well-known regional artists and musicians began buying inexpensive housing in old warehouses and converting them to impressive living quarters. The first artists credited with settling'' the district were poet Stephen B. Smith and sculptor S. Judson Wilcox. Many other artists followed as did art galleries and other venues that would showcase their work. As restaurants and nightclubs moved in, however, prices in the neighborhood went up and most of the artists left the vicinity and moved to other less pricey areas. Rejuvenation of the area continued through the 90s and into the new millennium. Many of the warehouses were torn down and replaced with parking lots to provide room for the onslaught on traffic that was now making its way into the area. Today, the heart of the Warehouse District is West Sixth Street. This is where one will find the largest crowds on weekend evenings and the most well-known nightlife establishments like the Cabaret Dada Theater, known for its improvisational comedy, and the Velvet Dog, with its rooftop patio bar. Restaurants also line the eight-block area, offering a plethora of opportunities to enjoy a variety of cuisine. In addition to eateries and nightspots, many of the old warehouses here have been converted to office buildings and others have become residential developments. Most architects were careful to maintain the ornate exteriors of the buildings, many of which were constructed during the Victorian era. Today, real estate prices in the Warehouse District are among the most expensive in the city of Cleveland. Most owners are young, urban professionals who work in the downtown area and choose the location for its convenience to their job and its trendy atmosphere. The most recent new development in the Warehouse District was a $1 billion project initiated by Stark Enterprises. The complex planned by Stark, when complete, will stretch from the lakefront to Public Square and include housing, retail space, offices, and a parking structure. It will be completed around 2011."

"The Wilds","Ohio","The Wilds - Cumberland, Ohio - conservation center and research facility in Ohio","Located in Cumberland, Ohio, The Wilds is a non-profit conservation park that covers an area of almost 10,000 acres. This facility is not like a normal zoo, with exhibits and buildings; rather, it provides a natural habitat where animals can live and scientists can research different species. Guests can see animals at The Wilds as they would be seen in nature. The idea for the Wilds was first proposed in 1984. Originally, this facility was going to be a partnership between the Ohio Departments of Natural Resources and Development, the Ohio Zoological Parks, and private donors. Around this time, the Wilds was incorporated as The International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals. They received a gift of land in 1986 and opened their visitor center in 1989. The first animals were brought to this area in 1991, and the public began accessing the park in 1994. Today, the Wilds is a private facility with close ties to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. The Wilds does not serve as a place for people to take tours and see animals, but is rather a conservation area for research and animal management. One of the focuses of the facility is conservation medicine. Scientists at The Wilds research animal health, finding links between the health of the environment, the health of animal species, and the health of humans as a whole. The goal of those studying conservation medicine here is to solve medical problems in a way that takes ecology into consideration. Residents here are experts in fields such as veterinary medicine, wildlife management, restoration biology, and so forth, and their experiences and research helps both animals and people. Animal Management, Husbandry, and Health is another main research program topic at the Wilds. Many of the animals found at this facility have declining numbers in the wild, and smaller population in isolated areas can cause severe genetic problems for future generations. At this facility, they work to supplement wild populations is the most natural way possible. Most of the animals here are free-range on the 10,000 acre grounds, so returning animals to the wild is much easier and more successful than in most captivity-based breeding programs. Restoration Ecology is also a research program at The Wilds. The environment at this center is not full of enclosures and changes. Instead, animals are able to roam the grounds as they would in nature, with few barriers. Researchers can study the impact of certain environments on these animals to learn more about restoration and environment health in the wild. The Wilds is home to both native Ohio species and exotic species of animals that do well in Ohio's climate. Some of the animals you can see here include Przewalski's wild houses, bacrian camels, Pere David's deer, bison, giraffes, swans, African wild dogs, Grevy's sebras, cheetahs, rhinoceroses, and American burying beetles. They also have a Carnivore Conservation Center, full of education information about some of the animals found at the facility, a Caf,, a Butterfly Habitat, and a Birding Station. All tours are guided by staff members, and guest can book a tour from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily during June, July, and August or on weeks during May, September, and October.

Housed mostly in a large Greek revival building that was designed by architects Edward B. Green and Harry W. Wachter, this museum owns an impressive collection of works that span several centuries. The Toledo Museum of Art was founded in 1901 by local glassmaker Edward Drummond Libbey and several other entrepreneurs who envisioned the mission of TMA as a place that would enhance the community with art and art education. The 36 acres of building space that make up the museum have grown to house about 30,000 works of art.

"Toledo Zoological Gardens","Ohio","Toledo Zoological Gardens - Toledo, Ohio - medium city zoo with 6,000 animals on 80 Acres","It all began with a woodchuck,'' says the history page at the Toledo Zoological Gardens web site, and indeed it did. Back in 1900, an unnamed benefactor contributed a single woodchuck to the City of Toledo's Parks Board. From that single woodchuck and the conversations around building a home for the little critter grew the park that would eventually become the area's top family attraction and one of the finest zoos in the nation. The history of the Toledo Zoo is an especially appropriate one for the current times. Many of the Zoo's existing structures were built during the 1930s, as part of the WPA - the Works Project Administration - which lifted the country out of the Great Depression. The Reptile House, the Aquarium, the Aviary, the Amphitheater and the Museum of Science are beautiful buildings that all date back to those Depression days, starting in 1933. So beautiful and so well-constructed are they that many of them are still serving the same purpose for which they were built. Even more than that, though, the WPA buildings are a special part of the history of both the zoo and the area. The Reptile House, for instance, was built almost entirely of salvaged materials - marble, timber and stone salvaged from old railroad buildings and canal locks. As early as the 1930s, the Toledo Zoo was already conscious and conscientious in saving money by reusing resources. That spirit lives on today in the tendency of the Toledo Zoo to refurbish and re-use existing structures rather than demolish and build new. Thus, a trip to the Toledo Zoo is like a walk back in time. It is, however, a walk back in time that is informed by today's best practices in zoo keeping, education and conservation. In 1982, the ownership and management of the Zoo was handed over from the City of Toledo to the Toledo Zoological Society, a private, non-profit corporation created specifically to manage the day to day operations and future of the Toledo Zoo. Since then, there has been a steady stream of renovations and renewals at the Zoo. The Reptile House was renovated and refurbished, and the Aviary was rebuilt, winning recognition from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in the form of an Exhibit Award for Excellence. Since 1985, the Toledo Zoo has averaged 875,000 visitors a year, with those numbers topping 1,000,000 in 1988, 1994 and 1999. In addition to the animal exhibits, the Toledo Zoo also offers special events during every season, including Music Under the Stars at the open air Amphitheater and Lights Before Christmas. The zoo is open year round except Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. Hours vary by season. Admission is $11.00 for adults; $8.00 for children age 2 to 11. Discounts are available for groups, military, and Lucas County residents among others.

"USS Cod Submarine Memorial in Ohio Provides a Look at American Maritime History","Ohio","USS Cod Submarine Memorial in Ohio Provides a Look at American Maritime History","	Docked on Lake Erie in the downtown section of the city of Cleveland, Ohio, the USS Cod Submarine and its accompanying memorial are a popular Cleveland tourist attraction. Located near Burke Lakefront Airport and just a block from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the USS Cod is a National Historic Landmark, declared as such in 1976. The USS Cod was indeed named for the fish that is considered to be the most important food fish'' in the world. A World War II GATO Class submarine, it was built in 1942 at the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut and launched for the first time in March 1943. It was placed in commission three months later. During its lifetime of duty, the USS Cod Submarine was used to maim enemy ships, fighting numerous underwater battles during the war. The Cod served in the Pacific theater of the war, destroying many a Japanese vessel and assisting the U.S. in its victories in that portion of the world. The ship was eventually decommissioned and put in reserve in 1946, only to be restored to active duty in 1951, chosen to participate in NATO anti-submarine training exercises. She was decommissioned again in 1954. In 1959, the vessel was sent to Cleveland to serve as a training ship and was eventually turned into a museum in 1976. In all, the ship sunk 12 enemy vessels totaling more than 37,000tons, and damaged another 36,000tons of enemy ships. The Cod received seven battle stars. Those visiting the Cod today will have the opportunity to view it as it was during the war years as the ship has not been altered in any way. Agile visitors must be prepared to climb up and down small, narrow ladders and make their way in and out of the ship's original hatches. Tours are self-guided and include a chance to experience the way members of the U.S. Navy lived aboard the tight quarters in this historic diesel-electric submarine. In addition to being a museum vessel, the USS Cod Submarine serves as a memorial to the more than 3,900 U.S. military personnel who lost their lives aboard a submarine during the 100 year history of the U.S. Naval Submarine Forces. On the shore near the submarine are a number of other items guests can view including a Mark 14 steam-driven torpedo, which functioned as the standard anti-ship weapon during the Second World War. The Mark 14 could travel up to 9,000 yards and carries 600 pounds of explosives. Also on display is a five-bladed, 2,080-lb. bronze submarine propeller that is similar to the two four-bladed propellers used on the Cod. The propeller serves as the location for the plaque that designates the ship as a memorial to the fallen. Guests can also view a type 8A search periscope, originally located aboard a 1950s-vintage submarine. The submarine is open for tours daily from May 1 through the end of September from 10 a.m. until 5 p.m., but guests may view the memorial plaque throughout the year.

"Victorian Village Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio is Charming","Ohio","Victorian Village Neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio is Charming","	Located northwest of downtown Columbus, Ohio, the Victorian Village Neighborhood is a long-established region of the city that had its start in the early 19th century. Officially bounded by Goodale Avenue on the south, N.High Street on the east, W.Fifth Avenue on the north, and Harrison and Neil Avenues on the west, the area features a fine collection of Victorian-style homes, thus its name. Along with neighboring Short North, it has gained a reputation as a gay-friendly area, but people of all persuasions live and work in this bucolic neighborhood. Many of the homes in the Victorian Village Neighborhood were constructed as long ago as the early 19th century when the street car first extended into the region along Neil Street, still the village's main thoroughfare. Much of the area's early population were wealthy businessmen and their families who built large, opulent homes near public transportation but somewhat removed from the then city center. There were also several large farms in the area that were later subdivided and turned into parks or sold to developers. Like many portions of the city of Columbus, urban blight came to this neighborhood in the post World War II years when suburbs began to spring up and people left the city for the quieter areas that surrounded it. Victorian Village was one of those areas that became run down and crime ridden by the late 50s. In the 1960s and 1970s, revitalization of the neighborhood began when the city declared the area an official historic district. Low interest loans were offered for urban renewal projects and many artists and others looking for affordable housing took advantage of these, purchasing homes of all sizes and renovating them. The result, 40 years later, is one of the city's loveliest districts, complete with many intact Victorian homes, thanks to the 1974-formed Victorian Village Architectural Review Commission, which sees to it that the treasures here maintain their architectural integrity. A stroll around the Victorian Village Neighborhood will allow visitors to view a number of different styles of Victorian homes, including Italianate, Queen Anne, Second Empire, Carpenter-Stick, and Four Square. Other architectural styles are evident as well, such as Tudor, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Romanesque. The largest homes can be seen around pretty Goodale Park while the smaller domiciles are on the side streets. Each September, the Victorian Village Neighborhood sponsors an annual Victorian Village Tour of Homes and Gardens, providing a prime opportunity to view these homes on the inside. This tradition began in 1975 and is still one of the highlights of the year for architectural history buffs who live in Columbus. Ten homes are showcased each year, and for a small fee, guests can visit each one and receive a tour by the homeowner. The committee in charge always takes care to choose a variety of homes for the event, including new construction. Churches are often included as well. A preview tour and reception are also offered at an additional cost."
"West Side Market in Cleveland, Ohio is a Local Treasure","Ohio","West Side Market in Cleveland, Ohio is a Local Treasure","	Originally founded in 1840, Cleveland's West Side Market is an indoor/outdoor farmer's market-type establishment that contains more than 175 stalls for vendors peddling various kinds of food stuff, from fruits and vegetables to meats, seafood, and baked goods. Located in the Ohio City neighborhood of Cleveland, the market has enjoyed a long and mostly prosperous past, eventually landing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The marketplace originally sat on a plot of land across the street from the current West Side Market and consisted of several stalls inside a one-story wooden framed building. It was originally known as the Pearl Street Market. As Cleveland continued to grow through the end of the 19th and into the 20th century, more space for the market was needed. The city hired the architectural firm of Hubbell and Benes to create a new location for the market. The result of their designs was a neo-Classical and Byzantine-style building made of brick and featuring a large interior concourse with about 100 stalls. The building, completed in 1912, also featured 85 outdoor stalls and a large clock tower that quickly became a city landmark. That same building still stands today though it has been renovated or added to a number of times at the cost of several million dollars each time. Though West Side Market struggled throughout the 1980s and 1990s, tenants and locals rallied to keep it alive. The market has also received national attention via appearances on cable TV shows and in 2004, underwent more major architectural and structural renovations. Today, West Side Market includes more than 100 vendors. Produce sellers still account for almost half of the market but other food is sold here are well. Many ethnic markets have long occupied spots in the market, with some stalls belonging to the same family for several generations. Greek, Italian, German, French, Cambodian, Chinese, Polish, Russian, and several other international cuisines are represented at this market and it has become the place to shop for the freshest foods in the area. Since 1915, the marketplace has been overseen by the West Side Tenants Association, an organization that still exists at the market today. This organization and others who support the market are already planning the facility's centennial celebration, set to take place in 2012. West Side Market is open daily except Sundays and is closed on some major holidays. Special events are held on occasion. Tours are offered on a regular basis and the market is a common field trip location for local school children. With everything on one level, the market is also totally handicapped accessible."
