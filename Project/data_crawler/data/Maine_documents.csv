"Belgrade Lakes Golf Course","Maine","Belgrade Lakes Golf Course, Belgrade Lakes, Maine - A 5-Star Golf Course in the Maine Hilltops","The Belgrade Lakes Golf Course is a hilltop course located in the rolling hills of central Maine. Like its hilltop perch, the course sits similarly high atop the rankings for Maine golf courses. It was one of only a handful of courses in the nation to receive a 5-Star award from Golf Digest in 2002 for the magazine's Places to Play'' rankings. It also vies with Suglarloaf every year for the honor of best golf course in the state. The course opened in 1998 and was designed by British golf course architect Clive Clark, who in 2001 was ranked #1 in GolfWorld's 25 Hottest Architects of the Year.'' In his designs, Clark tends to emphasize variety, playability and balance, with the goal to provide an exciting and enjoyable golfing experience. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 6,723 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 72.2 and a slope rating of 135. The course features lush, tree-lined fairways, ribbed bunkers and a number of large boulders and rocks sprinkled throughout. The course overlooks the Belgrade Lakes Region, and offers incredible views and panoramic scenery that's said to rival any in the state. Another interesting feature is that, even with 200 feet of elevation change, very few holes play uphill - a fact most golfers will enjoy. It's been said that every hole on this course is noteworthy, making it difficult to choose any for special praise. Hole No. 1, however, sets the tone, as few golfers will forget the experience of driving from a tee box situated 200 feet above lakes and ponds that stretch for miles, and more than 100 feet above the landing area. Hole No. 3 is a par-5 that plays to 475 yards from the Black tees, and designer Clark felt it was going to be one of the more spectacular holes on the course. Trees line both sides of the fairway until giving way to a large water hazard on the left nearer the green, along with a string of rocks that runs along the right before broadening into a small rock quarry near the end of the fairway. Hole No. 5 is a par-3 that plays to 174 yards and has been lauded by many golfers as the prettiest on the course. What makes it so picturesque, and challenging, are the tall grasses and water hazard that must be carried to reach a green isolated in a horseshoe of trees. Three deep, timber-clad bunkers are cut sharply into a bank that runs just behind the green. While this hole shouldn't be especially difficult, the challenge comes from the layering effect'' from the tee, as the eye goes from rough, to water, to rock, to rough, to green, to bunkers, to woodlands behind, making for a splash of textures.'' When the course first opened, many golfers rated hole No. 9 as their favorite on the course. This strong par-4 is considered a true test of golf,'' as it twists between the rocks on the left and the trees on the right, before ending with an approach shot to a long, narrow and elevated green. The hole is built into an amphitheater'' that's said to be worthy of hosting the Ryder Cup,'' according to one golf magazine. The course also features a large, New-England-style clubhouse that sits atop a plateau that overlooks the course."

"Eartha, the Largest Rotating Globe in the World is in a Small New England Town","Maine","Eartha, the Largest Rotating Globe in the World is in a Small New England Town"," The town of Yarmouth, Maine is a typical small New England town. With only 8,300 residents and a main street lined with historical homes and mom and pop businesses, Yarmouth seems like it could be right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. But there is one landmark in Yarmouth that is not typical of sleepy American towns: Eartha, the world's largest rotating globe. DeLorme is a business that provides mapping products. Eartha was designed by the CEO of the company, David DeLorme, and is housed at the companies Yarmouth headquarters.  Eartha is 3D model of the world that moves to simulate the actual movement of the earth. In 1999, the Guinness Book of World Records confirmed Eartha's title as the biggest rotating globe, and no one has beaten that title yet. Just over 41 feet in diameter and weighing 5,600 pounds, Eartha was bigger than the world's previous largest globe, the Globe of Peace, by more than 9 feet. Incidentally, the Globe of Peace, which is located in Pesaro, Italy, was stationary. Eartha was built to a scale of 1:1,000,000, and a rotation is completed each minute . It was designed in such a way as to mimic what one would see if looking at the earth from space. Eartha took two years to build, and the globe is detailed right down to major cities and roadways. Even the depths of the oceans are accurately represented. One would need 214 CD's to hold Eartha's 140 gigabyte database. Visitors are welcome to see Eartha for themselves at the DeLorme headquarters where she resides in a glass atrium. The globe is open to the public during normal business and there is a gift shop next to the atrium. If you do decide to pay a visit to Eartha, be sure to also stop by the Yarmouth Historical Society where you can learn about the 300 years of human history'' that has taken place in the town . Many small towns have a claim to fame, but only a few have an actual Guinness Book of World Records title that is unlikely to be broken anytime in the near future. Even if someone does build a larger rotating globe, it is unlikely that it will include the attention to detail that makes Eartha such a wonder."
"Funtown Splashtown USA","Maine","Funtown Splashtown USA - Saco, Maine - Family-Themed Amusement and Water Park","Funtown Splashtown USA, also often referred to simply as Funtown'', is a family-themed amusement park and water park located in Saco, Maine. It first came into being as the brainchild of Ken and Violet Cormier when they first opened a drive-in restaurant called Marvel Drive-In in 1959. Years later in 1963, Ken's brother-in-law Andre opened a miniature golf course right next door. From there, the number of entertainment options available in the immediate area continued to grow as batting cages, an archery range, a gift shop, and eventually a selection of kiddie rides were eventually opened as well by the pair as well. In 1967, Funtown as people know it today was officially born and it has continued to grow in both size and scope ever since. As is the case with many amusement parks, one of Funtown's main draws for potential visitors is its carefully chosen and exciting collection of rides and attractions. One of the most popular and well-known of these is without a doubt the Excalibur, notable for being Maine's one and only wooden roller coaster. Thunder Falls is another noteworthy attraction, as it is the tallest and longest log flume style ride in the entire New England area. Other popular rides include the Astrosphere, an indoor Scrambler-style ride that features incredible music and a state-of-the-art, visually stunning laser light show. The Dragon's Descent is Funtown's answer to the popularity of the drop ride, measuring up at a heart-pounding 220 feet high itself. Very popular in the Splashtown section of the park is the Pirate's Paradise attraction, a giant-sized, extensive interactive water play park that literally douses its guests with hundreds of gallons of water once every few minutes. Tornado and Mammoth, two new thrill-style rides that were added to the park in 2007, are also must-sees for anyone looking to spend time in the Splashtown section of the park. Food and refreshment options cover the typical selection of culinary options typically found at amusement parks. Hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, sandwiches, and chicken are all available for meals.

"Samoset Resort Golf Club","Maine","Samoset Resort Golf Club, Rockport, Maine - Ranked by Golf Digest as the 7th-Most-Beautiful Golf Course in America","The Samoset Golf Club is part of Samoset Resort, located along the Mid-Coast of Maine just south of Camdem. The 18-hole championship course is set amid some beautiful scenery as it winds through seaside vistas, lush, green hills, woodlands and gardens. Seven of the 18 holes play along the ocean, while 14 holes features ocean views, including Penobscot Bay. The course has a long history, opening for play in 1902. It got a redesign in the 1970s, followed by some recent upgrades by Maine golf architect Bradley Booth to freshen and strengthen the course layout. Renovations were made to holes four and five, the 18th hole is new, and a new practice facility was added. A granite seawall was also added to provide golfers some protection from the ocean. The par-70 course plays to 6,548 from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 70.8 and a slope rating of 129 on Bent grass. On such a scenic course, just about every hole is noteworthy, beginning with Hole No. 1. This par-4 plays to only 388 yards from the back tee, but golfers immediately come face-to-face with the first of many intimidating shots. The tee shot must navigate water hazards left and right and find the landing area, while approach shots must carry another small water hazard to a long, narrow green guarded on either side by bunkers. Hole No. 3 is a breathtaking par-3 that plays to a challening 227 yards from the Gold tees. From the tee, shots must contend with rough, steep cliffs and the ocean as it pushes into the mid-point of the hole to find a double green. If that's not challenge enough, ocean crosswinds will often force golfers to compensate for the added drift. Hole No. 4 is one of the holes that received extensive enhancements, including the addition of a seawall. This legendary signature hole plays to 503 yards alongside Penobscot Bay and the tee shot dares golfers to cross the Atlantic. The more conservative play is to a landing area that doglegs left as the hole curves around the water. The next shot plays to a newly constructed, contoured green with added elevation and bunkers guarding the front, sides and back. Finishing out the round, golfers will tackle the completely new 18th hole, a par-4/5 depending on the choice of tees. The hole plays to 478 yards from the Gold Tees, with the left side of the fairway guarded by water and out-of-bounds, and the right tree-lined and guarded by a string of four bunkers. Approach shots must then take aim at a tiered green that's guarded by bunkers on all sides, a pond short and right and water farther to the left. Throughout the long history of the course, it has received numerous awards and honors. Golf Digest ranked Samoset Resort Golf Club as its Top-Ranked Resort Course in New England,'' as No. 52 on its list of Best Upscale Courses in the U.S.,'' and as the 7th Most Beautiful Course in America.'' The course also played host to the 2001 New England PGA Section Championship and has been a qualifying event on the Nike Tour. Practice facilities include a driving range and putting green with practice bunker. There's also a clubhouse with a full-service pro shop, which also offers club rental and storage.

"Sugarloaf Golf Course","Maine","Sugarloaf Golf Course, Carrabassett Valley, Maine - A Spectacular Golf Course in the Rugged Backwoods and Mountains of Maine","For golfers who like trees and more trees, such as those found in the heart of Maine's backwoods, punctuated by numerous sand traps and the sort of rugged terrain that is the hallmark of mountain golf, then Sugarloaf Golf Course in Carrabassett Valley, Maine will rank high on the list. Long known for being a winter haven in the heart of ski country, the Sugarloaf Course opened in 1986 and added golf to the area's soaring mountains and what has been described as one of the prettiest areas in the northeast. Course designer Robert Trent Jones, Jr. had this to say, calling Sugarloaf One of the most spectacular courses I've ever been associated with.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,956 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.4 and a hefty slope rating of 151. That's because, along with the beauty of such rugged, stunning scenery comes the beast,'' as mountains jut from the ground in jagged patterns and account for the severe elevation changes found on the course. Golfers will experience the challenge of dreadful uphill approach shots'' to blind greens, as well as fairways tight with trees on every hole. In addition, there's a six-hole stretch called the String of Pearls'' that runs alongside the Carrabassett River, bringing the added challenge of water into play. This stretch is particularly scenic and is said to get camera shutters popping.'' The String of Pearls begins with hole No. 10, a 334-yard par-4 that plummets from the tee box to a fairway that's guarded by five bunkers. Hole No. 11 follows and plays to 190 yards from an elevated tee and a stunning view of the valley below. Hole No. 14 is a 370-yard par-4, and Hole No. 15 a 178-yard par-4 from the Blue tees, and both 14 and 15 feature intimidating approach shots over the rocky shoreline of the river. Since opening, Sugarloaf has been given a number of awards and accolades, including being rated by Golf Digest as the #1 layout in Maine for seventeen straight years. Similarly, the New England Journal of Golf has crowned Sugarloaf as the best course in all of New England several years running. Practice facilities at Sugarloaf Golf Course include a practice putting green and an expansive chipping area located in the middle of the surrounding course. Lessons are available, including the Sugarloaf Golf School, which has been hailed as one of the best in New England. The course also features a new clubhouse completed in 2005.

"Sunday River Golf Club","Maine","Sunday River Golf Club, Newry, Maine - One of the Newest and Best Upscale Golf Courses in Maine","The Sunday River Golf Club is part of the four-season Sunday River Resort located atop the hills overlooking Sunday River Valley. Built in 2004, the 18-hole championship golf course is relatively new, but has already begun staking a claim as one of the best in the state, competing against more established courses, such as Sugarloaf and Belgrade Lakes. The course is a Robert Trent Jones, Jr., design set on a wide hillside in some of Maine's most picturesque forests amid a mountain setting. The Mahoosuc Range towers over the Sunday River Valley, and the golf course is patterned after the natural mountain topography, making for some challenging golf and spectacular views. Old Spec, the third-highest peak in Maine, is clearly visible in the mountain range. The par-72 course plays to 7,130 yards from the Black tees, with a USGA rating of 75.2 and a slope rating of 146 - numbers indicative of the dramatic elevation changes found on the course. In designing the course, Jones opted for a mix of playability and challenge, as the course features broad fairways and generous greens, along with strategically placed doglegs and bunkers. Golfers will also encounter dramatic downhill and uphill shots, a good deal of mounding, and not a level hole on the course. For the most part, Jones designed the course so that a downhill hole was followed by an uphill hole, and vice versa, so golfers will feel an added variety in play. There's also not a drop of water to be found on the Sunday River course, but a number of other challenges take its place. The course is designed with a lot of movement, and missing any green will make for an awkward recovery. It's on the greens that golfers will also often lose strokes, thanks to some extreme shelving and contours that demand approach shots be hit to the correct side of the pin. There are also some Jones' trademarks on the course, including well-positioned hazards, plenty of waste areas and numerous forced carries. Since opening, Sunday River Golf Club has begun to accumulate the awards and accolades. GOLF Magazine ranked Sunday River as one of the Top 100 Courses You Can Play,'' while Golf Digest named it one of the Top 10 Best New Upscale Public Courses'' in the country. It's been said that just about every hole on the course could be a signature hole, but some of the more noteworthy and daunting holes include No. 9 and No. 14. Hole No. 9 is a short par-4 at only 339 yards from the Blue tees, but features two dramatic forced carries over deep ravines, one off the tee and another on the approach. Hole No. 14 is the longest par-3 hole on the course at 213 yards from the Black tees, and is all forced carry. Off the tee, golfers must traverse an expansive, sandy waste area to a Redan'' green, named after the original No. 15 Redan hole on the West Links at North Berwick Golf Links in Scotland. The green of a Redan hole typically slopes from front to back and right to left and is guarded by bunkers. Practice facilities at Sunday River include a driving range with six target greens, as well as a large putting green. The Club also features a choice of lodging options, including more than 700 condominiums and two full-service Grand Resort Hotels."
