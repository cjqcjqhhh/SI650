The cruise operates every day between May and September aboard the fastest and largest catamaran in the state, the Klondike Express. The boat sails through the protected waters of Prince William Sound and provides passengers with great views of the glaciers and wildlife as well as narration by a US Forest Service Ranger. The Klondike Express is a 137 foot high catamaran that can hold 342 passengers on three decks, two of which are enclosed and heated. It has comfortable upholstered booths with tables and large windows at every seat to ensure passengers get a good view at all times. The non smoking vessel also features a saloon, snack bar, gift shop as well as seven restrooms and a hot lunch is provided as part of the experience. Departing from the city of Whittier on the northeast shore of the Kenai Peninsula, the catamaran takes passengers 145 miles through the passageways of Prince William Sound. It begins by heading east through Passage Canal to the Egg Rock sea lion rookery in Port Wells before moving on to Esther Passage, a scenic area where only small ships can pass through. The high mountains surrounding this small passage protect it from high winds and rough seas, and here many different types of wildlife can be seen such as bald eagles, sea otters, the occasional puffin and even whales. Moving on to College Fjord the catamaran heads north providing passengers with wonderful views of the glaciers, which were named after the Eastern Colleges during the Harriman Expedition of 1899. Edward Harriman was a rich and powerful man in the U.S who owned several railroads, but on advice from his doctor to rest he set off on a two month journey from Seattle along the coast of Alaska and on to Siberia. Harriman was joined on the trip by various scientists, naturalists, photographers and artists from various colleges. The cruise moves on to Surprise Glacier and Barry Arm located in Harriman Fjord and then up to the front of the glacier so passengers can see house size blocks of ice rising from the sea. As the vessel heads back to Whittier there is a stop at another rookery, where passengers will see many of the 10,000 kittiwakes that inhabit the rocky cliffs here. From the rookery the catamaran heads back to the marina at Whittier, which is just a five minute journey. The cruise departs from Whittier at 12.30pm and returns by 5.30pm although on some Mondays and Saturdays there are sailings from 1.15pm, returning at 6.15pm. If driving from Anchorage to the Whittier Tunnel staging area, passengers should allow for a journey of about one and a half hours.

"Canoeing Loop in National Park","Alaska","Canoeing Loop in National Park","There are plenty of opportunities to canoe and kayak in the Katmai National Park, and the Savonoski Loop is one of the best options. It is an 80-mile loop which means if you complete the entire trip, you end up where you started. The thing to be aware of with this experience is that it is not for beginning canoers. There is often poor visibility because it frequently rains in the area. Many people who are expert canoers report they had difficulty navigating the loop due to tough vision. The loop is long and it takes a lot of work, but it is no comparison to hiking to the loop. If your focus is strictly on navigating the waterway, have a plane drop you at the starting point instead of hiking in. This will reserve all of your energy for the canoe trip. The views in the area are spectacular, and the wildlife is not to be missed. Do your best to bring along your camera and keep it dry because there will be plenty of chances to take photos.

"Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Archaeological District in Alaska is Remote yet Breathtaking","Alaska","Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Archaeological District in Alaska is Remote yet Breathtaking","	One of the largest National Monument areas in the United States, Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Archaeological District sits in northwestern portion of Alaska above the Arctic Circle. This 650,000 acre park was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1973 and received U.S. National Monument status in 1978. Close to the town of Kotzebue, Alaska, it is also one of the most remote National Monuments in the National Park system. The ecosystem of the region consists mainly of coastal plains with large lagoons and limestone bluffs that border the Chukchi Sea, which is situated between Alaska and Siberia above the Bering Strait. The shoreline stretches for about 70 miles within the borders of the park. The co-located archaeological district contains 114 ancient beach ridges and evidence of 5,000 years of habitation. Trees are non-existent but wildflowers provide color in the summertime and migratory birds show more signs of life all year round. Access to Cape Krusenstern National Monument is by small aircraft as there are no roads in the park. The Visitor Center and a small staff of park rangers are located in Kotzebue, which is where visitors will catch their air transport to the park. The landscape is wild and survival skills are essential, including backcountry experience and knowledge of bear safety. Cellular phones do not function within the park but many visitors carry satellite phones. Rangers at Kotzebue will document visitors' itinerary but are not stationed in the park to assist with emergencies. Two very different groups of activities are carried on in the summer and in the winter at Cape Krusenstern. During the warmer months, when temperatures average in the mid 50s and can be as high as 70 degrees, outdoor recreation is a pleasure. The sun never sets between approximately June 3 and July 9 so visitors can enjoy the park 24 hours a day. Activities include sea kayaking along the pristine and breathtaking coast and fishing in the lagoons, either from the surf or from a boat. Hiking and backpacking are also enjoyed during the summer months though there are no designated trails and many private lands line the park, so trekkers must be diligent as to where they hike. Hunting (for reason of gathering food) is also permitted at the national monument area so care should be taken not to interfere with local residents' subsistence activities. In the wintertime, skiing and dog mushing are popular sports. However, the extreme weather, which can reach as much as 50 below zero, demands close attention and knowledge of cold weather survival skills are a must. The Chukchi Sea is covered in ice from November until May, so water recreation is not possible during this time."

"One Hundred Year Old Lighthouse","Alaska","One Hundred Year Old Lighthouse","Guard Islands are two islets near the northern entrance of Tongass Narrows which opens to the town of Ketchikan. The larger of the two islands is home to the Guard Island lighthouse, considered one of the most easily accessible lighthouses in the state. The lighthouse's construction began in 1903 and it lit up for the first time on September 15, 1904. It had a 34-foot wood tower and the minor optic lens is mechanized to strike every 20 seconds. Along with the lighthouse, there is a 1.5 story lighthouse keeper's cottage on the island, as well as a boathouse and an oil storage facility. Over the years, the wood used to build the lighthouse deteriorated due to the nearly 200 inches of rain Ketchikan sees each year. The original structure was replaced in 1924 made of reinforced concrete. It was at this time that a second keeper's home was built on the island. In 1939 the lighthouse went from being managed by civilian keepers to the Coast Guard. In 1966, two deer pets, Wickie and Kado, would wander near the Guardsmen and have their ears and chins petted. During the night, Wickie slept at the foot of the keeper's bed. These deer roamed the island and were long-time beloved pets of the Coast Guardsmen. Currently, Guard Island Heritage hopes to transform the lighthouse into an art gallery and museum. they also have plans to surround the island with a boardwalk. There is a self-guided tour that visitors can take to enjoy the vegetation, wildlife, and rich history of the island."

The summit reaches to 108 miles above Fairbanks and towers over 3,600 feet in the air. Aside from its treacherous travel conditions, the location is unique because it is one of just a few places on Earth that allows a person to see the sun at midnight when standing north of the Antarctic Circle and south of the Arctic Circle. Because the summit is located between the Yukon Flats and the Tanana Valley, weather the winds and precipitation on the summit is affected by weather changes in either the Flats or Valley.
