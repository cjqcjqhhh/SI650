With an open air shopping mall, historical architecture, year-round festivals, concert music, a wide variety of dining and shopping venues, street entertainers and nooks to explore to get away from it all, this place has everything a person could want and then some. The concept of Market Street and Church Street originated in 1958 as part of a series of discussions of urban renewal. During the summer of 1971, a one day street fair trial was conducted in four blocks of Church Street, and approximately 15,000 people attended. Successful Street Fair was taken as a demonstration of the feasibility of a mall. In late 1971, Patrick Robins, president of downtown Burlington Development Association and local architect Bill Truex (then president of the City Planning Commission) recognized the potential of the mall. With his guidance, a second week-long street fair is held along Church Street in the summer of 1972. Traffic was diverted from four blocks from the Church of the street parallel to the street, transit has been added for the week and short-term physical changes (such as adding trees, benches, and booths) were conducted in the street. The merchants were allowed full use of the product display area for retail and special events were planned. An estimated 50,000 people attended during the week. A design for the church of the street was discovered in March 1978, covering a two-tier scheme, with a lower level below the street level, connecting the adjacent buildings through their basements. The lowest level to add 80,000 square meters of commercial space to the total of the city without the new construction, and provide 20,000 square feet of city-owned retail space. In March 1979, the City sponsored panel discussions and local residents and traders responded negatively to the idea of a two-level mall. The Steering Committee decided to eliminate the two-tier scheme, and a new plan was conceived. The new plan includes what the street level to sidewalk level, resurfacing the street with brick, adding canopies and shelters, the closure of the street cars in the two central, and implementation of downtown bus cycle to allow buses to cross Church Street into two intersections. The overall plan was approved by the voters of the city that year. The Courtyard Burlington Harbor is located just steps from Lake Champlain, Burlington Town Center, Market and Church Street.

"Green Mountain National Golf Course, Killington, Vermont - The State's #1 Public Golf Course for 2009, According to Golf Digest","Vermont","Green Mountain National Golf Course, Killington, Vermont - The State's #1 Public Golf Course for 2009, According to Golf Digest","Green Mountain National Golf Course was the state of Vermont's first municipal course, opening in 1997. The course is situated in Central Vermont in the mountains not far from the Killington Ski Area, and features some stunning vistas, including centuries-old rock formations carved by glaciers. As a municipal course, some budget considerations went into its design, which led to the close proximity of cart paths, boulders and trees to the fairways.  That has led some players and reviewers to describe the course as infuriating,'' since tee shots must really be kept under control and in the short grass with the hazards so close by. On some holes, such as No. 12, the fairways have been described as constricted by the cart paths.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,598 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 72.1 and a slope rating of 138. The course is carved out of the Green Mountains, and features gently sloping fairways with some generous landing areas, distinctive elevation changes and undulating greens. The course has been said to include its fair share of stunning holes. Some of the most noteworthy include No. 2, a par-4 that plays to 412 yards. This hole features a completely blind tee shot, along with a button players must push as they're leaving the tee, lest they get hit in the head by the next foursome teeing off. Once golfers pass over the crest, the hole features a Cape style'' with a lot of uneven lies and a fairway that curves around a pond with the green tucked behind it. Hole No. 6 is a par-5 that plays to 510 yards and has been called a strategic gem.'' The hole features a split fairway that forces players to choose the shorter-tighter route and greenside bunkers, or the longer but wider route with a clearer approach to the green. On the back nine, it's been said that this is where the course really comes into its own. Hole No. 10 is a par-4 that plays to 423 yards and provides quite the view from its elevated tees. Players must tee off over rocky outcroppings to a fairway that appears about as wide as a narrow street from the tee. That's not just hyperbole, as trees and rocks line the fairway just yards from the short grass. And Hole No 16 has been described as a jaw-dropping beauty,'' a short par-4 that plays to only 374 yards from the tips. Since opening, Green Mountain National has received several prestigious awards, including being named by Golf Digest in 2009 as the #1 Public Golf Course in the State. Practice facilities include a full-size driving range, large putting green and short-game area. Lessons and clinics are also available.
