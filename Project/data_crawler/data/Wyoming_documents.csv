There are two mudpots on the top of the hill where the trail tops out. A hiker is then led to Fountain Paint Pots.

"Buffalo Bill Historical Center","Wyoming","Buffalo Bill Historical Center, Cody, WY","The Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody Wyoming encompasses six different museums. They are the Buffalo Bill Museum, The Whitney Gallery of Western Art, The Plains Indian Museum, The Cody Firearms Museum, The Draper Museum of Natural History and The Harold McCracken Research Library. The complex is at the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park in Cody, Wyoming. Visitors can reach the museum from the north on Highway 14A which is Bighorn Ave then turn right on to Sheridan Avenue. The address is 720 Sheridan Ave. Buffalo Bill's Museum displays the personal and public persona of Buffalo Bill Cody. He lived from 1846 to 1917. The collections in the museum explore and interpret the history of American cowboys, dude ranching, frontier entrepreneurship and how we see the source of the concepts of the West. With his personality and talent Buffalo Bill became a communicator of life in the West. Buffalo Bill himself described his shows as an education on a grand entertaining scale. He incorporated Indians, cowboys, trick shooters and specialty acts in his outdoor shows. There was even a Buffalo Bill's Cowboy Band that played appropriate music to accompany the acts in the arena. They were highly trained musicians and set the mood for the action. Buffalo Bill's show ran for thirty years and toured in the United States and Europe. Sitting Bull and Annie Oakley were an integral part of his show. In a time when travel was not possible for many Americans he brought the Wild West to them. The Whitney Gallery of Western Art is celebrating its fiftieth year. They have art that portrays life in the old west with animals and Indian culture. The Plains Indian Museum gives visitors insight into the lives of the Plains Indian peoples. Guests of the museum will learn about their culture, traditions, history and values. It will also explore the scope of their lives today. Many of the pieces in the collection are from the early reservation period of 1880-1930. The tribes that the museum relates this information about are the Lakota, Arapaho, Crow, Shoshone, and Cheyenne. If visitors come in June they can enjoy the Plains Indian Museum Powwow in the Robbie Powwow Garden. It features dancers from all over North America as they compete in Cody for at least $25,000 in prizes. Next is the Cody Firearms Museum that displays the most comprehensive assembly of American firearms. The Winchester Collection was brought to the museum in 1976 from New Haven, Connecticut. Although Winchester is in the museum it is certainly not the only manufacturer of firearms on display. The Draper Museum began in 2002 as the inspiration of benefactor Nancy Draper. This natural science museum associates, staff and students have authored or coauthored over 30 book chapters and articles. They go across the country delivering lectures on topics such as the direction of natural science museums in the 21st century. The McCracken Research Library has many materials on Western American Art, Buffalo Bill, the Plains Indians, American firearms and the natural history of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains."
"Canyon Village","Wyoming","Canyon Village, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone is a national park with numerous surprises located in the northwest section of Wyoming. There are four entrances into the park allowing tourists from all over the United States and world to visit the park with ease. One place visitors may wish to stop on their travels is Canyon Village. The village is 40 miles from the west entrance of Yellowstone, 38 miles from Gardiner, 48 miles from Cooke City, and 43 miles from the east entrance of the park. The village itself is not the main attraction in the area. It is more of a resting place for travelers before they move around the various activities found in Canyon. Canyon Village has a post office, three restaurants, two grocery style stores, a place for getting gear, and souvenir shops. There are also a few cabins and a large campground within the village limits. Concessionaires provide various supplies for those going on horseback rides along the trails. The nearby stables have guides to take visitors out. There are also other park rangers available for hiking tours. The first stop tourists need to make in Canyon Village is the Canyon Visitor Center. The center offers a number of books on the park, its geology, and the volcanoes and glaciers. Rangers are also on hand to help visitors find trail heads with the best paths for their requirements. There is an auto tour of the canyon area along North Rim Drive. This tour is subject to closures in winter when the roads become impassable with snow. The road begins as a two lane option, but becomes a one way road as it moves into the village. Visitors will pass the 500 ton glacial boulder that marks the entrance of Canyon Village if they come in from the east. The largest attraction in the canyon is Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. It is a natural structure that provides some of the most beautiful landscape photos. The canyon is much younger than the Grand Canyon, having been created by lava flows over time. Glaciers also blocked the canyon, so they eventually had to be melted by time and the lava to form the canyon visitors see today. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is 24 miles, with 1,200 feet depth in certain spots. The canyon also reaches 4,000 feet wide at certain points. There are two waterfalls within the canyon for visitors to marvel over. One of the falls, Lower Falls, is larger than Niagara Falls in terms of height. The Lower Falls is 308 feet whereas Upper Falls is only 109 feet in height. Visitors can see Upper Falls from The Brink, Upper Falls Trail and Uncle Tom's Trail. Lower Falls can be found by looking out from Lookout Point, Red Rock Point, Artist Point, the Brink of the Lower Falls, and points on South Rim trail. About 63,500 gal/sec of water flows over the falls during peak runoff season and 5,000 gal/sec during the fall season will make its way from the high mountains over the falls."
"Canyon Visitor Education Center","Wyoming","Canyon Visitor Education Center, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone National Park has a mission of conservation and education for people around the United States and the world. As a top attraction for visitors to Wyoming there are many things to see. For those interested in education they can stop by the Canyon Visitor Education Center. This facility is newly built and for the first time Yellowstone's volcano, geysers, geologic history, and hot springs are explained regarding how the distribution and abundance of wildlife was formed in this area. Visitors are welcome to explore the exhibits, video productions, real time data, and animations provided. Visitors will be able to see, hear, and learn about Yellowstone in a new and imaginative way. As the name suggests the center is located in the Canyon area. Visitors will have to pay the park entrance fee of $25 per vehicle or $12 per individual. Canyon Visitor Education Center is easiest to access from the north entrance of the park. It is on the northern loop of roads that run through the national park. Other attractions include Mount Washburn, Dunraven Pass, Norris, Indian Creek, Mammoth, and Tower Junction. If coming from the east on Highway 14 one would need to head north passing Fishing Bridge and head towards Artist Point. Canyon is not on the same loop as Old Faithful. The park has north, east, west, and south entrances. Exhibits in the Education Center include the Yellowstone: Land to Life film. This film explores how the geological forces such as fire and ice have been able to combine in order to create the landscape visitors see today. The video then explains how the numerous wildlife species such as wolves, moose, beaver, and others can exist inside the park. After watching the video visitors can explore the life size model of Yellowstone. This model map highlights in certain areas to give a recording of those features. For instance the map narrates the volcanic eruptions that have occurred, lava flow, earthquake faults, and glaciers of the park. The map is on the first floor of the building, and for an aerial view visitors can go to the second floor. Tribes native to the park have offered recordings regarding their perspective on the geology. There is also a 9,000 pound Kugel ball that shows global volcanic activity. While eruptions seem rare there are still some active volcanoes that could erupt at anytime. There are some large lava lamps around the world to show how volcanoes work. Yellowstone has one of the largest lamps to illustrate how the magma rises due to heat convection. It shows how the earth can move with this activity and form various shapes like geysers. Computer generated displays, murals, photographs, panoramas, and dioramas are also part of the Canyon Visitor Education Center. All habitats of Yellowstone will be depicted in the exhibits from the lodge pole forest to the grassland habitats. The visitor center is not the only attraction in the area; however, it gets a visitor started on what the loop and the rest of the park has to offer."
"Cascade Canyon","Wyoming","Cascade Canyon, Grand Teton National Park, WY","Cascade Canyon is located within Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming. This park has been in existence since 1929 when the mountains and lakes by the base of the Grand Tetons was all that was included. In 1950 the boundaries were expanded so that the adjacent valley floor was also protected. The park has several visitor centers but most of them are seasonal. Craig Tomas Discovery & Visitor Center is open year round with hours that vary from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm depending on the season.

Other wildlife that is in the surrounding boulder fields includes pikas and yellow bellied marmots. If guests look closely they may see mule deer or moose in the shrubs that grow near the mouth of the canyon. The smaller animals such as the squirrels, pikas and marmots often beg for food, but by doing so the animals may not continue to hunt for food having become dependent on unnatural food sources. Cascade Canyon goes through the heart of the Teton Mountain range. Jenny Lake lies at the foot of the mountains that make up Cascade Canyon. For a small fee visitors can take a boat ride across Jenny Lake. This scenic boat ride takes guests to the mouth of Cascade Canyon. If visitors want to hike instead they can follow the trail which is four miles around. One of the magnificent elements of this hike is a narrow bridge that is above the waters of Cascade Creek. Hidden Falls is about a quarter mile from the boat dock. These falls are about 250 feet high and the roar of the water, the mist and flowing water make it worth the walk. Inspiration Point is approximately three quarters of a mile from Hidden Falls. This is one of the best vantage points for viewing Cascade Canyon. Although many people turn back from here the trail continues and it becomes fairly level and easy to walk. The jagged peaks of the Tetons surround Cascade Canyon and provide wonderful beauty."

Events of the Cody Night Rodeo include bareback riding, tie down roping, team roping, bull riding, steer wrestling, saddle bronco riding and barrel racing. Bareback riding is where the cowboy holds onto a rigging made of leather with just one hand, and other than touching this rigging the cowboy can't touch anything else for 8 long seconds. Tie down roping is when the cowboy throws the lasso to catch the calf. His horse must be trained to come to a stop once this has happened. Once the cowboy has caught the calf he dismounts and throws the calf then he ties three legs together all within 35 seconds. The calf must remain tied on a slack rope for 6 more seconds. The team roping has two cowboys, one as the head roper that has to catch the steer with a rope. They can rope it around the horns or one horn and the head or the neck. Then the second cowboy called the heeler has to bind both hind legs. A good time is considered less than 7 seconds. Bull riding is the most popular of all the events and is the most dangerous. This event is judged on control and the cowboys get extra points if they use their spurs. A flat braid of rope is looped around the bull's chest while the cowboy holds on with one hand. This is an 8 second ride demanding physical and mental skills. Steer Wrestling is the fastest event in the rodeo. It is almost 100 years old and the cowboy uses brute strength and leverage to throw the steer to the ground. When the steer busts out of the chute there are two cowboys that follow the steer path. The bulldogger slips from the saddle to grasp the steer by the horns and get him to the ground with all 4 feet upward. Saddle bronco riding is an 8 second event with the cowboy riding bareback.

"Devils Tower National Monument a Popular Wyoming Landmark","Wyoming","Devils Tower National Monument a Popular Wyoming Landmark","Attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year, Devils Tower National Monument was the United States' first national monument, declared as such by President Theodore Roosevelt in September 1906. Once obscured by its surroundings, particularly the sedimentary rock that rose around it, erosion has now made this unique geological formation one of Wyoming's most noticeable landmarks. Most geologists refer to Devils Tower as an igneous intrusion, formed by the forced entry of molten rock between other rock formations, eventually forming columns. Others believe it to be a volcanic plug or the neck of an extinct volcano; however, no volcanic activity has been evident at the site. Devils Tower National Monument has long been revered as a sacred place by many Plains Indians. The National Park Service (NPS) recognizes more than twenty tribes that have probable cultural affiliation with the landmark. Others have historic and geographical ties to the area where Devils Tower sits. For many American Indians, the tower is known as Bears Lodge and scores of tribal members visit annually to attend sacred ceremonies at the site, which is situated near the towns of Sundance and Moorcroft. Each year, avid climbers head to Devils Tower in large numbers, dubbing it one of the best traditional crack climbing areas in North America. With large hexagonal columns that soar up to 400 feet high, the monument offers technical challenges even for experienced climbers. A climbing management plan required by the National Environmental Policy Act helps to lessen the impact of the sport on the monument and climbers must follow strict guidelines when scaling Devils Tower. Many Native Americans have opposed climbing at the site, expressing concerns that it desecrates their sacred area. Due to these issues, the NPS has instituted a voluntary closure policy during the month of June, when many American Indian ceremonies take place at the monument. During this time, the NPS asks climbers to voluntarily refrain from climbing on the Tower. Most climbers comply with the request. In addition to climbing, three hiking trails are available to visitors and most are easily accomplished by even inexperienced hikers. The National Park Service also offers other activities at Devils Tower National Monument, including guided walks, interpretive lectures, a cultural program series, and a junior ranger program for children. For visitors wishing to stay overnight near the monument, The Devils Tower Campground, situated along the Belle Fourche River, offers sites for tents and RVs. The campground is open from the end of April to the end of October, the most popular time for visiting and climbing."
"Eastridge Mall","Wyoming","Eastridge Mall, Casper, WY","Eastridge Mall is located in Casper, Wyoming, which is one of the busiest cities of the state. The mall is handy to the entire city, being in one of the most popular areas. It is one of three shopping malls in the entire state. Eastridge Mall opened in 1982 with 90 stores, a food court, and four screen theater with second run movies. Eastridge is owned by General Growth Properties, which is one of the largest mall and real estate development corporations in the USA. They offer a number of malls throughout the Northeast and Midwest. Outside on the perimeter of the mall are Red Lobster, Starbucks, and Game Stop. There is also an empty building at the moment, which has housed such restaurants as Wienrecks, Sidelines Sports Bar and Grill, and La Cocina. When the mall had its grand opening many of the stores were already moved in. However, the Bon Marche took a little over a year to move in after the grand opening. The original mall owners were Price Development Corporation. Unfortunately they were unable to keep the mall. Over the years Sears and JC Penney made their way to Eastridge Mall. Target and the Commonwealth Theaters were also located at the mall in the beginning years. A few years after the mall was created it needed a renovation of the floor tile, wood seating, and plants. It was mostly all cosmetic. In 2000 the theater closed due to issues with Carmike Cinemas. However, it was decided the theater could still play movies, which is when the second run theater moved in. Anchors have included JC Penney, Macy's, Ross Dress for Less, Sears, Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, and Best Buy. Two anchors no longer there are Gart Sports and Bon Marche. Eastridge Mall is open Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm. Sunday hours are 11am to 6pm. There are mall events throughout the year including sales and Santa visits. Currently in the movie theater are some of the movies which appeared in theaters two months ago. So, while they are second run they are at least some of the more popular movies to hit the screens. Stores on site include Aeropostale, Alltel, Lady Foot Locker, American Eagle, Armed Forces Recruiting Center, MasterCuts, Mauries, Motherhood Maternity, ND Zine, Asian gifts, Pac Sun, Bath and Body Works, and Payless Shoe Source. Also at the mall is Pet City, Picture in a Frame, Blue Wire, Boot Barn, Pro Image, CJ Banks, R&R Pet Barn, Casper Real Estate Today, and Radio Shack. The food court houses a number of mall favorites including Pretzel Maker, Flaming Wok, Golden Express, Home Town Buffet, Hot Dog on a Stick, Subway, Taco John's and Java Jitters Expresso. The mall offers a number of different shops and eateries for the cities within driving distance of Casper. Vacationers to Yellowstone can also take advantage of the Casper Eastridge Mall if they come from the right direction. Wyoming is mostly a state of farms and ranches, which is why there are only three malls."

"Fairy Falls","Wyoming","Fairy Falls","The rivers that run through Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming offer plenty of different water falls to see. Fairy Falls is just one of the more distinct waterfalls of the park. It is located near Old Faithful in Teton County. The falls stand at 197 feet and can be hiked to. The trail is not for pets, so they must stay in the car. The hiking trail is 5 miles to Fairy Falls with an elevation of 7,300 feet. The best time of year to hike to Fairy Falls is April through September when the water is flowing freely. In spring a lot of runoff from melting snow will make the waterfall fuller.   The entire hike is quite easy due to the paved areas and boardwalks that lead up to Fairy Falls. To get to the trail head one should go from Old Faithful on Grand Loop Road heading for Madison. It is 4.7 miles from Old Faithful to the turnoff. It is also 11.6 miles south of Madison. The trail leading to the falls passes Mid Geyser Basin, Twin Buttes, and Spray Geyser.

"Firehole River","Wyoming","Firehole River, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Firehole River is one of the natural wonders of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. When visitors travel the Old Faithful Loop they will encounter this river. The river runs on the western side of the loop along highway 191. If travelers come in from the south they will travel highway 89/287/191. To reach Firehole River visitors will take a left onto the loop instead of right. It will take visitors past West Thumb, Craig Pass, and Old Faithful. Around Old Faithful the river will be picked up where individuals can see it from their car. As they move through Lower and Midway Geyser Basins to Upper Geyser Basin they will follow the river north towards Madison. The river can also be picked up from the west entrance by taking highway 20 to the loop and hanging a right. From the north highway 89 will take visitors around the west side of the northwest loop to the Old Faithful loop. From the east highway 14 is required to bring travelers to the loop. From the east one can take a right or left to reach Firehole River. The distance is about the same; however, if they want to see Old Faithful first a left is needed to go around Fishing Bridge Visitor Center and Yellowstone Lake. Park entrance fees are $25 for vehicles and $12 for individuals such as bikers. Firehole River is one of the more interesting water attractions in the park due to its pathway through Yellowstone. Firehole begins in the wilderness as a stream, like most mountain streams, until it reaches the three major basins of the area. When it hits Upper Geyser River and travels to Lower and Midway the water gushes over the rocky riverbed and has an interesting hydrothermal influx. The river is 30 miles long, and water comes from the hydrothermal influx making temperatures increase by 25 degrees Fahrenheit from its origination point. How it works is that the water from the mountains is cooler from the higher elevations. It streams along until it hits Upper Geyser Basin with geothermal activity relating to the volcanoes. The temperatures increase and some of the underground water will gush into the river rather than explode out of the geysers. The same applies to Midway and Lower basin, which is why the temperature eventually becomes 25 degrees F hotter. The water in the river has spent several hundreds of years to work through the underground channels. It erodes the earth and carries with it bicarbonate, arsenate, sodium, and chloride to the surface. It was estimated by scientists that Firehole carries 68 tons of chloride and bicarbonate every day. About 3,000 to 4,000 gallons of this thermal water is poured into Firehole River every minute during the day. As a result of the mixture of minerals and water, Firehole River is able to grow algae and bacteria faster and in greater numbers than other rivers. A number of organisms live on top of the water, underneath and around it making Firehole River an ecosystem all its own."

Day use, camping and annual passes available. Summer temperature highs - 80's Motel accommodations - yes, near Dutch John and nearby Manila One February 2009 reviewer said, Flaming Gorge has it all. From the scenic headwaters of the Green River that Powell discovered through the beautiful Firehole area, the camera gets used a lot. Fishing is great for large pan sized rainbow trout. Lakers go over 50 pounds from your boat which is handy on the 95 mile long gorge. Camping is everywhere. Lots of deer, elk, and wild horses if you take the time to slow down and look for them. The drive around the gorge and stop for the dam tour should take all day if you do it correctly which is the way I did and recommend to others. The stay in Rock Springs was rewarding. There is much there to do as well.'' Another online reviewer stated, The Flaming Gorge WAS beautiful! It was a long drive from the east entrance to the best part of it but once we got there it was perfect. We don't camp or didn't have a boat there but looked like a great place to do both! There was a nice visitor's center at the Dam; it was all a nice surprise! Just remember driving the whole thing took us about 3 hrs stopping and starting but was worth it!''"

"Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone","Wyoming","Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone National Park has numerous natural features worthy of visiting. The park is located in the northwest of Wyoming, and has been a national park for more than a century. The government felt the trees, animals, and land should all be saved from deforestation or residential growth. Yellowstone has half of the worlds geysers located within its boundaries, several lakes, hot springs, and more. One of the most amazing areas of Yellowstone is the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is not nearly as large as the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It is 30 miles wide and 45 miles wide, and can reach over 1,200 feet in certain areas. The canyon was formed when volcanic eruptions 600,000 years ago emptied an underground magma chamber. Part of the chamber became Yellowstone Lake, while the other half was left as a canyon when the roof fell. Volcanic substances were spread over thousands of square miles like lava rock, which helped to create pitting along the canyon walls. The lava did not just disappear when it helped form the canyon. Instead the lava remained creating Canyon Rhyolite flow about 590,000 years ago. The flow eventually weakened and the basin of the canyon was created. Other lava blocked the natural chambers rerouting lava and water flow, creating underground rivers. Glaciers that formed and then melted helped create lakes until the canyon eventually emptied, leaving behind its present form 10,000 years ago. Wind, water, earthquakes and other natural occurrences have helped to continue to form the canyon. The canyon is along Yellowstone River between Tower Roosevelt and Canyon. There are two waterfalls that run through the canyon allowing the water to come from the higher elevations and feed the lake. Artist's Point, Lookout Point, Uncle Tom's Trail, and other pathways will take visitors to scenic points to view the falls and the canyon. Visitors are also able to take the Canyon of the Yellowstone trail. This trail runs from Inspiration Point through the park. Glacial Boulder is one stop on this tour. The boulder came from Beartooth Mountains when Pinedale Glacier began to melt, allowing it to drop near the north rim about 80,000 years ago. Inspiration Point allows visitors to lookout over the canyon to see the walls rising from below. This will lead tourists to Silver Cord Cascade Overlook, where it is possible to see the trail as it moves into the canyon where the creek flows. As tourists continue they will come upon one of the falls at Lookout Point. Visitors can watch the water plunge into the canyon and create a plume of spray. Red Rock Point is another lookout point to see the falls from. It was named for the red rocks near Lower Falls. Iron oxide is found in the rocks, which has caused the irregular color. The tour will eventually take visitors around to the brink of the Lower Falls, where the water flows over the high canyon wall."
"Grand Prismatic Spring","Wyoming","Grand Prismatic Spring, Yellowstone National Park, WY","For anyone who wishes to see something truly spectacular Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming should be on the list. The hot spring is the third largest in the world, and the largest in the United States. For visitors to reach Grand Prismatic Spring one must drive to Midway Geyser Basin. This basin is located on the same loop at Old Faithful. The spring was first found by European explorers in 1839. They were part of the American Fur Company walking through the country to find animals to trap for fur. One of the explorers made a note of the boiling lake'' stating its diameter was 300 feet. In 1870 the lake was truly made noteworthy when the Washburn-Langford- Doane Expedition entered the area. They also wrote about the area noting the 50 foot Excelsior Geyser, which is nearby. Visitors who have seen images of Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone may wonder what provides such brilliant colors. The water is a vibrant blue, with red color like lava surrounding it. However, what looks like lava is actually pigmented bacteria. They form microbial mats around the edge of the water. The bacteria are not all red though. It can range from green to red depending on the chlorophyll and carotenoids provided. The temperature can also determine what color the bacteria favors. For instance in summer the mats will be orange and red. In winter they are often a dark green. The mats do not form in the center of the spring because the water is a great deal hotter. The bacteria are unable to grow. The blue water of the spring is brought about partly from the high purity and depth of the spring. Grand Prismatic Spring is 250 feet by 300 feet. It is 160 feet deep. Each year the spring will discharge about 560 gallons per minute at a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature can vary from 147 to 188 degrees F during the year. The temperatures, of course, make it impossible to swim in the spring. The water gets its heat from underground vents as part of the volcanic system that Yellowstone sits on. Instead of forming a geyser over the area, the land parted enough to make the spring. Visitors who wish to see Grand Prismatic Spring will find the entrance to the spring closest to the west entrance of the park. Visitors can pay $25 per vehicle or $12 per person to enter the National Park and explore the entire park. At Grand Prismatic Spring there is a wooden walkway that takes visitors over the earth, close to the bacteria and spring to get a truly decent view of it. Photos can be taken on the walkway with the steam rising from the spring and the orange bacteria edging closer to the walkway. Surrounding the spring are small rolling hills and mountains. These are in the distance and littered with pine trees adding lush green colors to the view of the spring."

"Grand Teton","Wyoming","Grand Teton, Grand Teton National Park, WY","There are many peaks in Grand Teton National Park, but the most prominent is Grand Teton. This peak has been compared to the Matterhorn in the Alps. It does share a resemblance with the European mountain. There are questions as to who the first person or people were that tried to ascend the Grand Teton. Some credit a French trapper named Michaud in 1843 although he was unsuccessful at reaching the top. He used rope ladders to try and get to the top of the mountain. The first real ascent of Grand Teton was claimed in 1872 by Nathaniel Longford and James Stevenson. However, William O. Owen was successful in 1898 with three other climbers and he claimed to be the first to reach the pinnacle. He eventually won the dispute. Another man Charles Kieffer might have beaten Mr. Owen by several years as he claimed a successful climb to the top in 1893. Geraldine Lucas is the undisputed first woman to reach the summit at the age of 59. From the floor of the valley Grand Teton stands out among the rest of the peaks in the Teton Mountain Range. Weather can bring on low clouds that will obscure the peak of Grand Teton. The top of the Grand Teton is above timberline so no trees grow there. Although Grand Teton stands out among the range it is clustered together with Teewinot Mountain and Mount Owen. These three peaks make up the Cathedral Group. Grand Teton is 13,770 feet making it the tallest mountain in Grand Teton National Park and the second tallest in the state of Wyoming. Visitors wishing to climb Grand Teton should look for the Owen Spaulding route. It corkscrews around keeping to easy ledges. It is rated a Class 4 non technical route, but be advised it is very exposed. The Exum Ridge route using the direct or partial route is an easy Class 5. Guests of Grand Teton National Park can get a guide to help them ascend the peak on this route. Guests of the park must have climbing training and be in good condition. Several of the routes begin at Lupine Meadows trailhead in Grand Teton National Park. They ascend to the Lower Saddle which is at 11,640 feet in elevation. It lies south of Grand Teton. The more difficult North Ridge can be accessed from the Lower Saddle. The only visitor center that is open throughout the year is the Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center. It is located twelve miles to the north of the town of Jackson, Wyoming. They close on all major holidays and provide information on hiking trails, issue camping permits and boat permits and give out activity schedules. There are restrooms and telephones located in the building with a post office nearby. While visitors have to have technical climbing experience for Grand Teton there are plenty of other easy hikes to enjoy within the parks boundaries. There are many areas to stay within Grand Teton National Park and get food."
"Granite Hot Springs","Wyoming","Granite Hot Springs, Jackson, WY","Visitors to Jackson, Wyoming will enjoy taking a short drive south of town to relax at Granite Hot Springs.

Grant Village Lodge also has two restaurants with lake views. The lake is Yellowstone Lake. One restaurant is a full menu while the other offers pizza and pasta. A lounge and small gift store are also on the premises. Grant Village Lodge is in the village limits of Grant on Lake Yellowstone. This lake is set in the southern section of the national park. It is east of the main road leading in from Jackson. It can also be reached by the four other park entrances, though it is closest to the southern entrance. Around the hotel are West Thumb Geyser Basin, Visitor Center, and the Continental Divide. From Grant it is possible to head to Fishing Bridge and the eastern section of the park or towards Old Faithful in the west. Visitors staying at Grant Village Lodge are able to make the rounds of the park with ease because of the handy location. The village of Grant is on the southwestern shore of Yellowstone Lake, which is twenty miles from Old Faithful. It is also near Grand Teton National Park. Grant Village Lodge offers natural surroundings with no smoking in the hotel. This also means no televisions, radios, air conditioning, or internet is supplied to visitors. Wheelchair access is possible in some of the rooms. Grant Lodge is only open from May to October. It is a summer location, unlike some of the other lodges in the park like Old Faithful Snow Lodge or Mammoth Springs Hotel and Cabins. Visitors will want to make their reservations early in order to get a room booked. The high range rooms offer a motel style appearance with telephones and private bath. The mid range rooms have just the shower, toilet and sink in the baths instead of tubs. All of the hotel room pricing is based on double occupancy. There are taxes and utility fees charged not included in the range pricing here: $145 to $151. There is a 6 percent tax and 4 percent utility charge added to each night once visitors receive their bill. The rates provided here can change as the park must get approval from the National Park Service each year regarding their rates.

For visitors who cannot afford the hotel or do not wish to stay at the hotel there are other options like RV and camping spots. The camp grounds have showers and bathroom facilities near Yellowstone Lake. The camping is typically no extra charge, but a permit is required. It will depend on the actual site you choose regarding cost since some will charge for the hook-ups and other amenities associated with the sites."
"Grant Village","Wyoming","Grant Village, Grant Village, WY","Grant Village, Wyoming is located in Yellowstone National Park. Grant Village is in the southern area of the national park near Yellowstone Lake and West Thumb Geyser Basin. It is just before visitors reach the loop that will take them to Old Faithful or around the Yellowstone River towards the north section of the park. This area of the park can be found with any of the five entrances, though it is closer to the Jackson entrance. Before heading into the actual village, visitors may wish to stop by the Grant Village Visitor Center. This center is on the shore of West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. It is one mile from the main park road at Grant Village Junction. The village and center are named after Ulysses S. Grant, the president who helped protect the land as a national park. In 1872 it was Grant who signed the bill. The visitor center was started in the 1970's. Some individuals did not feel this was the right place for a center or village because of the streams around it. The streams are spawning ground for freshwater trout, which means grizzly bears tend to stop by. Also in the area of Grant Village is the West Thumb Information Station. The little log cabin is the Yellowstone Association sales outlet. It is a place for visitors to go for interpretive walks and talks in the summer. In winter the hut is a warming station for visitors to warm up and learn about the winter season in Yellowstone. A backcountry office in which the staff can remain for spring and fall is also near the gas station and Hamilton store. These building are .75 miles from Grant Village Junction and on the road to the actual village. Grant Village is one place visitors can stay in the park. There is a lodge and other accommodations for visitors who wish to remain inside the park instead of leaving and finding a place in Jackson. The reason for staying in Grant Village is not only for the amenities like the general store, gas, and souvenirs, but also for the area attractions. Yellowstone Lake can be used for boating and other recreational activities. West Thumb is also near the lake with numerous geysers to trek around. The Abyss Pool and Fishing Cone are two of the area's highlights that should not be missed in West Thumb Geyser Basin. Grant Village is just a home base for visitors in the park. While the village is not as important as the natural wonders around it, it can be a good place to start. Grant Village is also near the 1988 fire. In 1988 a fire was started near Fall River in the southeast. This fire grew and spread over several weeks harming the trees and forest land. The fire moved quickly doing great damage, but now this area has new growth that is astounding to see when the devastation is compared to what visitors can see now."
"Green Dragon Spring","Wyoming","Green Dragon Spring, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Norris Geyser Basin is one of the areas in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming that offers numerous geysers. Yellowstone National Park has half of the geysers in the world, as it is. Visitors to the park can reach Norris Geyser Basin from any of the park entrances; however, it is closest to the west entrance in Idaho. Entry into the park is $25 per vehicle and $12 per person such as a biker. Once in the park the visitor can remain camping in any of the campsites, hiking, and enjoying a variety of villages within the park. For tourists coming in the west entrance Norris Geyser Basin is one of the first stops after Madison. It is near the Museum of the National Park Ranger and the Museum of Norris Geyser Basin. From Norris tourists can choose to go towards the north which takes them by Indian Creek. The other option is to return towards the south going through Madison to reach other geyser basins including Upper Geyser Basin with Old Faithful. Norris Geyser Basin and its location have been mentioned here to point visitors to Green Dragon Spring. Green Dragon Spring is one of the stops along the Norris Geyser Basin trail. The Norris Geyser Basin trail can be split into two trails: Porcelain Basin and Back Basin. Tourists wishing to see Green Dragon Spring will need to take Back Basin Trail. The entire walk is 2 and a quarter miles starting at the Norris Geyser Basin Museum. Back Basin is a loop which begins at Emerald Spring and ends at Minute Geyser. Green Dragon Spring is about half way around the loop. The spring is a hot spring like many of them in the national park. Except in summer, steam will rise from the hot spring. In summer the spring and air temperature are closer in temperature, eliminating the sight of steam. The spring forms underneath the earth in a cave. This cavern will fill with hot temperatures in which the steam rolls out and across the water that is seen on the surface. One must wait for the steam to clear before seeing inside the cavern, which is lined with sulfur. This sulfur is one of the reasons the water is actually green and boiling. Before Green Dragon Spring on the loop is Echinus Geyser. This was one of the more interesting geysers in the park in the last few years. It will erupt every 45 to 75 minutes. In 1998 it altered its eruptions to be only a few times per day. Still, when it erupts it will hit 40 to 60 feet high in the air. The eruptions generally last 118 minutes and the pool fills before it is about to erupt. Unfortunately in the last few years the geyser has not erupted at all. After Green Dragon Spring is the Porkchop Geyser named for its appearance like a pork chop. This geyser had an eruption with such force that the earth exploded, ruining its shape and ending the 216 feet spray."
"Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center","Wyoming","Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is dedicated to educating visitors about grizzly bears and gray wolves. Wolves have been endangered for several years and only recently been introduced back into Wyoming. This center is expanding each year since the time it was established. A recent upgrade was the Bird of Prey exhibit. They will also be adding a new walkway that leads from River Valley Wolf Habitat to the hawks, eagles, and owls. The bald eagle enclosure will include a cliff side structure that overlooks a small pond beneath. The message for the entire exhibit and center is that wolves and bears are part of the ecosystem and can be very influential on the raptor population. Construction on the new walkway and bird areas began in September 2009 and they expect a year will be needed before the construction is complete. Grizzly Discover Center is open daily from 8:30am to 4pm, even on holidays. The grizzly bears at the center do not hibernate, so they are available all year to see. Occasionally the hours may change due to seasonal issues, so it is important to check with the center before arriving on site.

A playground is on site for children who wish to get a little exercise. Picnic tables are also located on the outside perimeter of the facility. The grizzly bears, which are provided sanctuary at the facility, have come from all over the United States, though mostly from Yellowstone and Alaska. The bears arrived at the facility either because they were orphaned or posed as a nuisance in city areas. Typically the bears end up getting food from people, damaging property, or become aggressive, so the facility rescues them before they end up killed. Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center has eleven wolves that live in packs of three. The wolves were born in captivity and were not able to be released in the real world. They came from facilities that were unable to keep them any longer. Visitors can watch the wolves play, eat, and watch their hierarchy in the viewing areas. The center is very dedicated to educating anyone who stops by. They have a number of programs and outreach options to help anyone interested in learning. Children are able to join a daily program for learning how to be a naturalist and animal keeper. Children five through twelve are welcome in the program.

"Heart Lake","Wyoming","Heart Lake, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Heart Lake is one of the natural features of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. It is part of Heart Lake Geyser Basin. The basin begins just a few miles from the lake descending along Witch Creek lakeshore. There are five hydrothermal groupings within this area. The Washburn Expedition of 1870 is most important for finding many of the features of the park including this area. It is recorded that NP Langford's horse broke through the crust of the earth becoming scalded by the heat of the volcanic activity. Heart Lake is not accessible by road. Visitors have to drive to a parking area and then take a trail to the lake. The lake is halfway between the southern border of the park and Yellowstone Lake. It is most accessible from that southern entrance at Jackson; however, visitors can use any entrance to make their way to the southern area of the park for the trailhead. The trailhead is on the road from Grant Village. For visitors who wish to see Heart Lake, the trail is 7.5 miles in length. When taking the trail it is important to realize visitors will be camping along the trail overnight. Tourists who want this experience should go with a 50 pound pack that includes sleeping bag, food, and tent. There is a lovely spot for a picnic along the trail. Visitors who do hike the trail with food should take precautions against wildlife by packing their food in airtight containers. Tourists on the trail will go through certain areas where the 1988 fire burned. It is an excellent trail to see how ecosystems can recover from such things. The trail can be a bit dry and dusty at times as new growth works to cover the area. At least three to four liters of water should be brought along. The most dangerous wildlife on the trail will be grizzly bears. It is a wonderful experience to see the bears in their natural habitat, but again caution is wise. Do not keep food in the tent overnight. Instead place it in a tree away from the tent. Before coming to the park visitors should read up on bear information to be prepared. Bears can be peaceful and not be concerned about others in their territory as long as acceptable behavior is followed. Heart Lake is a fishing lake. A permit is required by a ranger at any of the ranger stations. For those who have a permit it is possible to catch dinner. Campsites along the trail are available with reservations. Registration with a ranger station is essential, but also free. The park rules apply for leaving the campsite as it was found and leaving only footprints and taking pictures. There will be geothermal activity at some of the features along the trail. Do not step off the trail going to Heart Lake, as the area around it can be unsafe.

"Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club, Jackson Hole, Wyoming - a Robert Trent Jones II Golf Course Design, New and Improved in 2007","Wyoming","Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club, Jackson Hole, Wyoming - a Robert Trent Jones II Golf Course Design, New and Improved in 2007","The Jackson Hole Golf & Tennis Club first opened more than 40 years ago. When Laurance Rockefeller, who was an avid golfer, purchased the property in 1967, he brought in Robert Trent Jones II to undertake a remodeling of the original course designed by Bob Baldock. Since then, Jones has been called back again in 2004 to once again redesign and update the course. Among the improvements and renovations of the $15 million project, Jones constructed 20 new tee boxes while adding more than 500 yards of length to the layout. The 1st and 15th holes were redesigned, new cart paths were added, and a state-of-the-art irrigation system was installed. The redesigned course now plays to 7,325 yards from the longest (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.4 and a slope rating of 133 on Blue grass. Water is a significant hazard on the course, and comes into play on about half the holes. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 3, a par-3 hole named the Blacktail.'' This hole plays to 203 yards from the back tees and features water that crosses the hole just in front of the tee box, then moves up the left side to surround the green, which juts into it. A bunker guards the green short and right, while trees sit long and right. No. 8 plays as the #1-handicap hole. This par-5, named Bearded Buffalo,'' is a monster from the back tees, playing to 610 yards. A subtle dogleg right, the hole features fairway bunkers at the first landing zone, then a relatively straight line to the green from there. The green is well-guarded, however, by water that cuts right in front of it and bunkers to either side. Hole No. 11 is the #2-handicap hole, as well as one of the most picturesque on the course. This is another par-5 that plays to 550 yards from the tips. Water is everywhere on this hole, surrounding the tee box then following the hole all the way to the green on the left. A subtle dogleg left, the hole plays toward a green that bumps right up against the water on the left, and is guarded by bunkers and trees on the right. As part of its recent renovation, the club features a new practice facility and driving range. There's also a new $7.5 million, 12,000-square-foot clubhouse that was completed in 2007.  The clubhouse is home to an expanded golf and tennis shop, luxury locker rooms, a fitness center, and the new North Grille restaurant. Other amenities at the club include four upgraded tennis courts, a new heated outdoor swimming pool, and a groomed Nordic track for use during the winter months."

Visitors to the area will find the best fishing is after the ice thaws, which is generally in the middle of May. However, if winter doesn't give way to spring it could be early June. Because the fish are looking in the shallows for baitfish, they are prone to the fisherman's bait. Ice fishing begins in January and this is when the big fish are most vulnerable. The Snake River flows into the Grand Teton National Park. This is the reason the fishing is so great at Jackson Lake. Depending on the time of year visitors go to the park, they may find wildlife along the shores and mild rapids on the river. Motorboats are allowed on Jackson Lake and Jenny Lake.

Hikes that can be taken from the Jenny Lake trail are to Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls. The trail around Jenny Lake is about 6.6 miles and is considered to be an easy to moderate hike. Guests of the park can take a boat ride across the lake instead of hiking if they prefer. By taking a boat shuttle from the eastern shore boat dock the trail is cut in half. Most people begin the walk at Jenny Lake Visitor Center. The parking lot is quite large, but does fill up quickly in the summer with visitors. After guests look through the visitor's center they take the trail around the lake or get on the shuttle boat. Because taking the boat is so popular there can be short waits at the dock. The shuttle boat lands on the western shore of Jenny Lake by the trailhead for Cascade Canyon. This trail also takes you on to Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls. Because the weather can get quite warm in July and August visitors should bring along a bathing suit to take a dip in the cold water of Jenny Lake to refresh themselves. If visitors to Jenny Lake are hungry after the hike, a fifteen minute drive north will take them to Signal Mountain Lodge for a great lunch overlooking Jackson Lake. The road that runs from Moose to Jenny Lake Trail is only open in warmer weather and closed throughout the winter.

"Laramie Plains Museum","Wyoming","Laramie Plains Museum, Laramie, WY - Museum","The town of Laramie, WY, started out as a tent city where a stage coach passed through, and then later the first transcontinental railroad. It was organized in mid-1860, and grew to today's population of about 27,000. Much of this tremendous history of the city and the Western life around it are preserved in the Laramie Plains Museum. The Museum itself is located in the Historic Ivinson Mansion. This home was built in 1892 and has been restored to house the museum artifacts. Tours through the museum are all guided and they take about an hour. The guides provide interesting information about the artifacts, as well as give historical information about the area. The house itself has 23 different rooms and it is entirely decorated in Victorian Queen Anne style. The furniture, artwork, and all decorations are amazingly beautiful and reflect the magnificent past. Special displays deal with cowboys and Indians, sheep ranching, and more. The mansion was the theme for a special article in Victorian Homes magazine. After living in their home for many years, the Ivinson family later donated the mansion to the Episcopalian Church. The Church turned it into a girl's home for a number of years, and then sold it in 1972 to the Laramie Plains Museum Association. The Mansion then became the home for the Museum in 1973. The original carriage house now serves as the Business office of the museum and the gift shop, too. The gift shop sells items of Victorian style and also books that are of local interest. A number of historic items are also on display there. Another building that was built on the property is called the Alice Hardie Stevens Center. When the mansion had become a home for girls, a separate building was made for the gymnasium and a dorm. Mrs. Stevens was the woman responsible to help prevent the building from becoming demolished. This building can be rented for your special event, wedding reception, or other activity. It has a commercial kitchen and some equipment. The East Lawn may also be rented, and the Museum can be rented, too, for a wedding, or similar event. Your event will need to be catered and many caterers in the area know and love the kitchen here.

The trail is about one mile and is considered to be an easy walk with mostly level terrain. There are views of the mountain peaks to the south of the park from Leigh Lake. The Leigh Lake Ranger Patrol Cabin is still on the northeast shore of Leigh Lake. There is construction work on the cabin to preserve it. The cabin was one of the first cabins built in the 1920's. It had been refurbished in the 1930's and remains the only example of this type of patrol cabin. The cabin has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Climbers that want to ascend Mount Moran will begin from Leigh Lake. Because it is very difficult to get to Mount Moran by land most climbers will canoe to the area. Canoes can be rented by Jenny Lake Lodge which is close to String Lake. The climbers then paddle north to Leigh Lake. After a brief portage of the canoes the mountain climbers can paddle across Leigh Lake to Mount Moran's flank. Besides Mount Moran, Rockchuck Peak also casts its shadow over Leigh Lake. There are two canyons in this area: Paintbrush and Leigh which cut into the Teton Mountain range by the west shore of Leigh Lake. The trail to reach both String Lake and Leigh Lake is kept in great shape. There are plenty of resting spots along the trail and sandy beaches await the hikers. There are two islands on Leigh Lake that people paddling canoes can see close up. The lake has fishing and plenty of bird watching. The wind can whip up waves on Leigh Lake especially by the west arm which leads to Leigh and Paintbrush Canyons. Jackson Lake is another visitor destination with spectacular views of the mountain peaks. This one is easier to reach because no hiking is involved. However, visitors will find more people on this lake than Leigh Lake. Motorized boats are allowed on Jackson Lake along with canoes and kayaks. There are fees for boating on Jackson Lake unlike Leigh Lake. Visitors to Grand Teton National Park must pay an entrance fee. A single entry is $25.00 for a seven day pass.

In fact the most popular geyser is Old Faithful, due to its history and geological significance. Lone Star Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is a back country geyser unlike Old Faithful. Back country geysers of Yellowstone are those found off the regular path. It means visitors cannot drive to them, but must walk. One reason to hike to Lone Star Geyser is to see it in a natural and pristine environment. There are no walkways up close or any lasting impressions of visitors other than the trail. At Lone Star Geyser visitors will not find pavements and hundreds of cars. It is a more aesthetic and authentic experience. Geysers are a spring that will discharge water high into the sky with a vapor of steam. Geysers form due to hydro geological conditions in which groundwater must move up from below the earth to escape. Geysers are releasing the pressure found near active volcanic areas. The magma under the surface creates high heat. The underground rocks heat up heating the water under the earth. When the pressure builds enough it will blow the water through the tubular opening, allowing steam to rise as well. The cone of a geyser can be short or tall, small or large. Lone Star Geysers cone is a massive structure that allows water to stream out of it every few hours. Geysers due to the magma and other minerals in the earth have sulphur that makes up part of the watery steam. This is what lends to the rotten egg smell of Yellowstone Geysers like Lone Star. The park entrance fee is $25 per vehicle and $12 per individual such as a person on a bike. Once visitors have paid the park fee visitors are able to move around the national park and visit any number of trails such as the one that will take visitors to Lone Star Geyser. There may be additional camping fees if you wish to remain in the park, but for a stroll to Lone Star it is free. To reach Lone Star visitors have to travel to the Old Faithful area of the park and pick up the trail head. The trail is one of easy walking lasting 4 1/2 to 5 hours. The distance is 4.8 miles. Elevation from the parking lot to the geyser provides a 40 feet gain. The road to the parking lot is paved, but the trail itself is dirt. The Lone Star Stroll to the geyser is not a loop. Instead it is an out and back situation. Visitors will walk through the scenic Firehole River area to work their way up to the geyser. Each summer there are activities within the park that take visitors to the Lone Star Geyser. For visitors who wish a guide they can sign up at the Old Faithful Visitor Center between June 11 and September 24th. These guided tours are every Thursday starting at 7:30am."
"Lower Yellowstone River Falls","Wyoming","Lower Yellowstone River Falls, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone National Park has two falls that are referred to as Yellowstone Falls. They are Upper Falls and Lower Falls. Lower Yellowstone River Falls is nationally one of the highest falls, which is why it warrants discussion separate from Upper Falls. The Yellowstone River will flow from the north where Yellowstone Lake resides. It moves through Hayden Valley before hitting Upper Falls. The drop over Upper Falls is roughly 109 feet. Yellowstone River continues its southward run for 400 meters or a quarter of a mile where it reaches Lower Falls. Lower Yellowstone River Falls is over 300 feet in height, which is higher than Niagara Falls. After this fall from great height Yellowstone River enters Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The canyon is over 1,000 feet in many places and 4000 feet wide. This canyon is 590,000 years old according to geologists. The water volume that moves over Lower Falls is by no means the same as Niagara Falls. Lower Falls is only 70 feet wide, which means less water can flow out at a time and the river just doesn't have the same amount of water anyway. During peak season about 63,000 gallons per second will flower over Lower Falls. In winter only 5,000 gallons per second will make the trek. Yellowstone River does have the distinction of being the largest volume of water per second in the Rocky Mountains, though. The Yellowstone Falls and specifically Lower Falls were discovered in 1846 when Jim Bridger happened upon them. He was the first white American to explore the area. In 1869 the falls were again discovered by the Folsom Party working for the US Government. Images of the falls were recorded in 1870 with Private Charles Moore as the artist. Viewing Lower River Falls is possible from several locations. For those wishing to drive through Canyon region, there is the Canyon Loop with overlooks and parking lots to get out and view the falls. The parking lots are also where the trail heads are for visitors who wish to walk closer to the falls. In one section there are stairs attached to the cliff walls of the canyon, which take one down to the bottom. From the stairs and other points it is possible to see the falls. On the Canyon Loop there is a last stop where a trail head takes one to the top of the falls. If visitors take the loop they will reach Canyon Village where supply stores, souvenir shops, and much more await. Horseback options are also available for those who do not wish to walk. While in the area visitors should check out the trail loop that brings them to Upper Falls. Though not as impressive, Upper Falls is certainly a picturesque place to take some photos or have a picnic. Tourists also have Firehole Falls, Gibbon Falls, Kepler Cascades, Undine Falls, Mystic Falls, Rustic Falls, Tower Falls, and Moose Falls to visit. These various falls are spread throughout the park."
"Mallard Lake","Wyoming","Mallard Lake, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Numerous natural wonders exist within Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Visitors can almost spend two weeks right in one area and never get bored. For individuals wishing to tour the park and its many wonders Mallard Lake is a great stop. Mallard Lake can be reached by any of the national park entrances but it is closer to the west entrance and Jackson entrance. Mallard Lake trail is near Old Faithful Lodge Cabins and Firehole River as a point of reference. It also means that Mallard Lake is near Old Faithful Geyser, Upper, Lower, and Midway Geyser Basins. Visitors will need to park near the lodge and cabins to pick up the trail head for Mallard Lake. There is a first right turn into the lodge area which takes visitors down the road to the trailhead. The trail will cross Firehole River, pass Pipeline Hot Springs, and then climb hills where lodgepole pine and an open rocky area allow visitors to view the lake. Mallard Lake Trail is not a loop. Instead visitors will return the same way. The trail is a total of 6.8 miles to reach the lake and back to the parking area. The trail is considered moderately strenuous. For visitors who want a longer walk they can take the Mallard Creek Trail. This trail will be picked up from the lake trail and is a total of 12 miles. Since the trail can be 12 miles in length visitors may require camping equipment to stay out overnight. There is camping in the area. Plenty of water should be brought along, as well as food. The pines one sees on the trail have been mildly affected by fire. The fire of 1988 ran through some of the area, wiping out the trees and some of the wildlife. Luckily visitors can see the re growth that is occurring. The growth is moving a little faster due to the nutrients left behind by the decaying fire ridden trees. Mallard Lake is filled with Lake Trout. At certain points in history the lake has been overly full of the fish. As a result the park rangers have allowed fishing. Grizzly bears will do their part in clearing out the trout up the rivers and streams. Along the paths you may even find some grizzly bear. It is important to know bear protocol to remain safe on the trails. Once done with the trail to Mallard Lake visitors to the area can explore the region around the trail and Old Faithful Lodge. Old Faithful Geyser and the trail to it present a number of other geysers like Excelsior. Old Faithful can be divided into the south and north sections. The south section contains Giantess Geyser, Doublet Pool, Solitary Geyser, Plume Geyser, and Lion Group of Geysers. There is a trail head for this walk as well. Any visitor wishing to stay at the lodge will have plenty of trails in the area to see the natural wonders including Mallard Lake and the creek."
"Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and Cabins","Wyoming","Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and Cabins, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Mammoth, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is near the Montana border of the park, with the last city as Gardiner before entering the park. It is also the northwest entrance, as opposed to the Silver City entrance to the northeast in Montana. Mammoth is the village where visitors will discover Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and Cabins in the park. This is one of the lovelier places for tourists to stay in the park. This hotel spreads over a few acres of land with numerous buildings nearby. Restaurants, gas station, the bus depot, and a general store can all be found in Mammoth close to the hotel. The hotel is named after the Mammoth Hot Springs, which are also in this area. The hot springs are a magnificent display of nature and how thousands of years can form geysers and hot springs. Since the late 1800's there have been a number of explorers and now tourists who have made their way to the hot springs. It was thought that there should be a comfortable place for tourists to stay, especially for those who would not want to camp out. As a result Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and Cabins were built. The hotel will remind visitors of the earlier 1900's with its slightly Victorian yet western style. Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel and Cabins are open for both the winter and summer season. Elk tend to graze around the hotel and the parade grounds that run through Mammoth. The grounds used to be the site of Fort Yellowstone, which no longer exists. Like any of the hotel accommodations within the park, Mammoth Hotel does not allow smoking, nor do they have televisions, radios, internet, or air conditioning. The hotel instead reflects the nature around it is much as possible. Reservations are required for both seasons to ensure visitors have a place to stay. The park entry fee is $25 per vehicle or $12 per individual. The hotel has rates which are set with National Park service approval. The rates run between $85 and $268 per night depending on the room choice. The suite is $427 a night due to the space and number of guests which can fit in the suite. The mid range rooms have baths with shower or tub, sink and toilet. These rooms have two double beds. They fit up to four individuals like all of the rooms. There are also rooms onsite without bathrooms. Instead these rooms will share a bath down the hall, but have double beds. The frontier cabins are more modern with shower, sink, and toilet. There are no telephones in the cabins. Hot tub cabins are set up with a six person hot tub on the front porch. These rooms have bathrooms, but no telephones. These cabins have one queen bed. The budget cabins do not have a private bath. Instead there are private showers nearby to use. Two double beds and no telephones can be found in these cabins. The suites have two queen beds and a sitting room."
"Mammoth Hot Springs","Wyoming","Mammoth Hot Springs, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone National Park can literally take weeks to explore with all of the brilliant natural wonders visitors can see. If pressed for time, visitors may want to at least check out Mammoth Hot Springs. Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is located near the north entrance near the park headquarters. It took nature several years to create Mammoth Hot Springs. First the right ingredients were needed, which are heat, water, limestone, and rock. The formation allows water from underground to reach towards the earth's surface. About 600,000 years ago a volcanic explosion occurred in the area of Mammoth Hot Springs. This explosion allowed magma to run through a chamber towards the earth's surface, pushing out the rock formations visitors will see. The hot water that still flows from the earth's crust has added additional terraces to the original rock formation. Some of the water is part of the rain and snow runoff that occurs during the year. When the cooler water reaches the heat it will raise the water temperature to the steaming water that is seen on the surface. The water being discussed here will come from several small fissures under the ground. One larger fault runs from the south at Norris Geyser Basin to the north. Norris Basin is 21 miles from Mammoth Hot Springs. However, it is this water that has helped create more than 50 natural springs in the Mammoth Hot Springs area. Park rangers have created groomed trails that are well marked for visitors. Anyone wishing to see the hot springs can park at designated trail heads and begin their walk. The trails will get visitors close to the formations, without endangering any lives. It is best to stay on the trails, and the park insists upon it. There are thin layers of crust off the trails that can crack and be extremely dangerous. On the trail leading to the Mammoth Hot Springs visitors will encounter Opal Terrace. Opal Terrace is near Capitol Hill and across the road from Liberty Cap. The spring began in 1926 with one foot of travertine per year. Before this time and until 1947 a tennis court stood near the spot. However, due to terrace expansion it was necessary to remove the tennis court. A house also stood near this spot having been built in 1908. Liberty Cap is a hot spring cone. This is a strange formation next to the terraces. It was named by Hayden Survey Party in 1871. Water helped form the limestone cone as it pushed out of the earth. Palette Spring is another interesting point on the trail around Mammoth Hot Springs. It has a hillside of numerous colors including brown, green and orange. Bacteria affected by heat grow on the hillside structure, so that it appears like a wet paint canvas. There are Lower and Upper Terraces. Other stops along the way include Minerva, Cleopatra, Jupiter, Main, Canary Spring, Overlook, Prospect, New Highland, Orange Spring Mound, Bath Lake, White Elephant Back, and Angel Terrace."
"Medicine Bow National Forest","Wyoming","Medicine Bow National Forest, Laramie, WY - Forest","If you love seeing the beauty of the outdoors - and playing in it - you will quickly discover why the Medicine Bow National Forest near Laramie, WY, could easily become one of your favorite places to go for fun. This part of the Forest has about 400,000 acres in the southeastern part of the state. Just about anything you want to do can be found in this area of the Medicine Bow National Forest. This area is just one of three areas in the Forest. It really is an outdoorsman's sports paradise. Among the activities you can do here are: rock climbing, fishing, boating and rafting, skiing and other winter sports, biking and hiking, horseback riding, and much more. Watching wildlife and birds is another favorite activity of many in this area. Looking carefully, you can find a wide variety of wildlife, including black bear, bobcat, mountain lions, elk, moose, and mule deer. You may also see prairie dogs, coyotes, marmots, badgers, and more. One place that is very popular with hikers and rock climbers is called Vedauwoo Rocks. This is about 17 miles from Laramie, just off Route 80, but it has some very unusual rock formations. These granite rocks are believed to have been left here by glaciers. People come to this unique area to climb these rocks from all over the world because it is considered to be one of the best crack climbs (called offwidths). The area is also popular with stargazers because it is not close to a city and is high up. Right near Laramie is Ryan Park when you want a place to go camping. This is right at the edge of town. It was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's. During the War, it was used as a POW camp after 1942 and until the end of World War II. It held both Italian and German prisoners. There are interpretive signs in the Park so that visitors can learn about its history. Hiking is popular in the area and there are a number of trails available. Some of them are certainly rather strenuous so you will want to look into each one before you get started on them. One event that is popular in the area is called Butch Cassidy Days, which runs for about three days at the end of June. This takes place at the Wyoming Territorial Prison State Historic Site, which you can find at Exit 311 (Snowy Range Road), on I-80. Events there will include living history exhibits, a tractor parade; a presentation will also be made about Butch Cassidy by a relative, exhibits, barbecue, and more. Special events for the children are also arranged and these include a scavenger hunt, prison bingo, and a stick horse rodeo supervised by Miss Butch Cassidy Days. Scenic drives are also common since the area has a number of mountain peaks around. The Snowy Range Scenic Byway offers visitors the chance to see snow-covered mountain faces - even in mid-summer. The route follows Route 130 and rises from 8,000 feet to 10,847 feet. A number of lakes and rivers are also around and will provide many more activities for the whole family, or just a place to get away. Medicine Bow National Forest at Laramie, WY is a very popular vacation spot all year around - depending on which outdoor activities you like most."
"Midway Geyser Basin","Wyoming","Midway Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Midway Geyser Basin is near Lower Geyser Basin on the main park road of Yellowstone National Park. It is one of many geyser basins within the park. It is located north of Old Faithful and Old Faithful Lodge. The entire Lower and Midway Geyser Basin covers 12 square miles including such geothermal points as Fountain Paint Pots. A driving tour can commence on Firehole Lake Drive which is a three mile road to Great Fountain Geyser and the Travertine Terrace. In Midway Geyser Basin visitors can see Excelsior Geyser. It is the largest feature of the basin and allows gallons of water to flow into Firehole River per minute. What characterizes Midway is the mammoth sized hot springs. When the area was first discovered there was only Lower and Upper Geyser Basins, but Midway's features are separated and remote from these two areas, so it was renamed to include Midway. Rudyard Kipling visited Yellowstone in 1889. During this time he called Midway Geyser Basin Hells Half Acre.'' Since then it has been nick named this. Part of the reason for this name comes from the two major hot springs found within the basin. One is Grand Prismatic Spring. This hot spring has a stair like terrace appearance with 370 feet in diameter from one edge of the pool to the other. Excelsior Geyser is the other major feature of the basin. It used to erupt about 300 feet into the air during the early 1900's. Now it is a dormant geyser and more like a hot springs. In its heyday it used to have 4050 gallons of water per minute discharge from it. Other springs like Turquoise and Indigo are also along the path for Midway Geyser Basin. Firehole River runs from Upper Geyser Basin to the Lower Geyser Basin along the walkway as well. Rabbit Creek has also been known to drain into the area, but much of the mud pots from the creek are unnamed. Caution is also required since the trails along Rabbit Creek are mostly unstable and not maintained. Excelsior Geyser has a temperature of 199 degrees Fahrenheit. Its dimensions are 276 by 378 feet. It was one of the largest Geysers in the world at one time. Since the last major eruption was during the 1880's it has since lost this distinction. Since 1985, even the little eruptions have stopped. Grand Prismatic Spring is known for its microorganisms which can turn the edge of the pool orange or green depending on the temperatures of the water. There is nothing like the rainbow of colors it displays anywhere else in Yellowstone. Turquoise Pool will vary from 142 to 160 degrees F. It is 100 by 110 feet. This pool was named by Hayden Expedition in 1878 due to its milky white bottom that creates a gem like blue on the top of the water. You can also see minerals floating in the water that are opalescent and iridescent in appearance. Microorganisms can be found in this pool also."
"Mount Washburn","Wyoming","Mount Washburn, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Members of the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition worked their way up a tall mountain peak during their explorations in 1870. This group of individuals eventually named this peak Mount Washburn after their leader Henry D. Washburn. This peak is found in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. It is also part of the Greater Yellowstone Range. Elevation for the mountain is 10,243 feet. The best route to take to the top of the peak is, of course, to hike it. There is one trail that will take visitors up to the very summit of the peak and other trails that will lead around the Yellowstone range, including some aspects on Mount Washburn. From the top of the peak it is possible to see the northern section of Yellowstone National Park and the Teton Range in the distance. During the summer this range can be very busy with summer tourists. Despite the ranges full elevation hikers will only climb 1,393 feet on the three mile hike from Dunraven Pass. There is a second path visitors can travel from Chittenden parking area. This trail is a little shorter, but it offers a 1,491 feet elevation change. The hike is only 2.25 miles though. Along the way tourists are able to see one of the active fire lookout towers. Yellowstone has three towers that are active for fire fighters and park staff. Fire fighters will take shifts at the towers daily to look out for any fires started by arson, accidental issues, or natural causes. Yellowstone has been the victim of fires due to the massive amount of dry forest the park contains. A disastrous fire in the 80's caused many acres to burn. Also along the path towards the summit is the small visitor center with restrooms. There is an observation deck on the second floor. The third floor of this structure has ranger quarters, so that they may remain in the park during the summer months. Before traveling to the park visitors can log on to Yellowstone National Parks webcam system to check out images from the fire tower of Mount Washburn. Mount Washburn is part of the Canyon area trails. For visitors who begin at Chittenden or Dunraven Pass, the summit is very close and a trail will continue on towards Canyon Village. The trail breaks off towards Seven Mile Hole which also runs along Yellowstone River. Visitors who do not go towards Seven Mile Hole can continue towards Canyon Village and work their way to Cascade Lake across the road. From Cascade Lake trails move to other Yellowstone lakes like Grebe and Wolf. There is not a loop trail for Mount Washburn. The trail is a down and back or down and to another parking area like going from Dunraven Pass to Chittenden parking area. For tourists who drive their own car they will eventually have to return by bus or hiking to their vehicle. There are transportation systems within the park, but they are in every area, so it is best to check if Mount Washburn has a visitors' bus."
"Museum of the National Park Ranger","Wyoming","Museum of the National Park Ranger, Yellowstone National Park, WY","The Museum of the National Park Ranger, located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming provides visitors with the story of the National Park Service and some of the most important park rangers to have existed within the system. National Park Rangers are imperative to the conservation efforts of the National Park Service or NPS. NPS began as a US Federal Agency August 25, 1916. They have over 21,000 employees with 392 units. Not all of the units are national parks; only 58 are including Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is one of the oldest national parks in the United States. It was established by US Congress in 1872 as a national park. It extends from the northwest corner of Wyoming to just inside Montana and Idaho. There are a couple of entrances into the park; one from the east and the other from the west. In the 80's a fire raged through part of Yellowstone National Park. Without the National Park Rangers this fire could have been more devastating than it was. Today much of the area has experienced a re-growth. Unfortunately Yellowstone has recently had a wildfire affecting another area of the park. The fire towers in the park are all filled with trained fire fighters who are also park rangers to help stop the fires. The Museum of National Park Rangers outlines these fire towers and the duties required of the rangers there. It also will list some of the men and women who have served the park during the fires and at other times. The museum is located in the historic Norris Soldier Station. The entire building is dedicated to the history of the national park rangers. It discusses when national park rangers came about, why they are needed, and even highlights the tools of the profession. Also included in the museum are some memorabilia of past rangers and the history of rangers. For example uniforms and how they have changed over the course of the century are provided for visitors. There is also a short film which describes the history of the National Park Service and how it has been instrumental in keeping Yellowstone as a park. Park entry fees are $25 per vehicle or $12 per individual for those who may walk or bike through the park. The museum will be free for those who pay the park entrance fee. The building housing the museum was built in 1908 for soldiers on patrol. A lot of the building had to be completely rebuilt due to disrepair, but original materials and the original floor plan was used. The museum is staffed with retired National Park Service employees. These employees volunteer their time, so there are no real set hours for the museum. It is open when there is a volunteer to run it. The museum does not have a gift shop for souvenirs. It is just about the history of the Yellowstone, the park rangers, and the National Park Service. However the Norris Geyser Basin Museum does offer a bookstore, which is nearby."

"Norris Geyser Basin","Wyoming","Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone National Park is filled with about half the world's known geysers. The park is located just north of Jackson in Wyoming. In the northern section of the park is a place called Norris Geyser Basin. This basin is on the upper loop of roads that wend their way through the park. To reach Norris you must pass the Museum of the National Park Ranger, and Norris Geyser Basin Museum if driving from the south, west, or east. Coming from the north out of Montana you will pass by Indian Creek before reaching Norris Geyser Basin. One must elect to head towards the basin because the loop can also take you east towards Tower Junction when heading south out of Montana. Norris Geyser Basin is considered the hottest area in Yellowstone with most variable thermal changes. There are two and a quarter miles of hiking trails to take you through the various geysers that make up the basin. Many of the geysers in the basin are active year round and a few of the geysers have become hot springs where microorganisms can be found. From the museum mentioned above you can take two loop trails: Porcelain Basin and Back Basin. During a tour of the Norris Geyser Basin visitors can move from Porcelain Basin to Black Growler Steam Vent. The steam can reach 199 to 280 degrees Fahrenheit, which makes it different from the geysers. Ledge Geyser is also on the path from Porcelain Basin where visitors can watch steam and air reach 125 feet into the air. The angle is such that it will actually reach the ground 220 feet away. Ledge Geyser is not a consistently active one; in fact it was dormant from 1979 to 1993, and had a fairly regular cycle in 1994 to 1995. There are ten stops on the Porcelain Basin route. Other geysers include Congress Pool, Hot springs, Blue Geyser, Whirligig Geysers, Colorful Water, Whales Mouth, and Crackling Lake. Back Basin Loop has seven geysers: Emerald Spring, Steamboat, Cistern Spring, Echinus, Green Dragon, Porkchop, and Minute Geyser. Porkchop is one of the more interesting geysers on this route due to its history. The geyser had an eruption of such power one day that it actually exploded the cone of the geyser. Now the earth is no longer in the shape of the Porkchop that it was named for. Minute Geyser used to be one of the more regular Norris Geyser Basin attractions, hence its name. However, over time the geyser has become irregular, no longer erupting every sixty seconds. It used to reach heights of 40 to 50 feet. Now the vent is smaller. This occurred in part to the need of removing some rocks on the western side of the vent. Heavy equipment damaged the rest of the geyser. The trek along Norris Basin is one of the more flat routes with beautiful trees and water for vacationers to enjoy. The paths have wooden walkways in certain areas to make it accessible to all."
"Old Faithful Inn","Wyoming","Old Faithful Inn, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Old Faithful Geyser has made waves in the world. Almost everyone knows about the geyser and why it was named Old Faithful. As one of the most popular locations within Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming it makes sense to have Old Faithful Inn across the street from the geyser. Entering the park is possible from a north, east, south, or west entrance. The west and south entrances are closest to the inn and the loop. Old Faithful Inn is almost as historical as the geyser itself. The inn was built in 1904 to look like a large log cabin. It was also registered in the National Historic Landmark registry. The exterior of the cabin has moderately sized logs, wood paneling, and wood shingles. The Old House'' has an extravagant lobby with a giant stone fireplace to welcome visitors. The original part of the inn has been added to, so not all sections will be historic. The East and West wings of the inn were added in the 1920's. These wings were remodeled in the rooms to make them modern and comfortable. A few of the guest rooms do not have private baths, as was traditional in the early 1900's. The inn like the rest of the park is non-smoking to keep the park and the house safe. The cabin was meant to reflect the natural area around it, which means televisions, air conditioning, radio, and internet are not available at the inn. Instead visitors are dared to go out and experience the nature around them, both to learn and have fun. Old Faithful Inn is not open all year round. They open in May and close in October. The winter months make it more difficult for guests to reach Yellowstone. Reservations are required at the inn to ensure they have space available. The suites provide onsite bathrooms with tub/ shower, sink and toilet. The semi-suites also have private bathrooms and a fairly large living space. The other rooms are ranked as premium, high range, and mid range rooms. There are also the rooms without the bathrooms which are the more economic. These rooms do have a sink with hot and cold water, but the bathrooms are just down the hall. The rates are based on double occupancy, and will change if more guests will be staying in the room. Each room can accommodate between two and four people. Rates are subject to change each year based on National Park Service approval. Taxes are not included in the costs provided here. The rooms range from $98 to $528 a night depending on the size of the room and availability. Old Faithful Lodge does have a cafeteria and bakery. Entrees offered include sandwiches, pastas, salads, cinnamon rolls, muffins, deli options, and cookies. They also have the Old Faithful Inn Dining Room and Bear Paw Deli. From the inn it is possible to reach the Old Faithful Visitor Center and several of the area geysers including the Midway and Lower Geyser Basin."
"Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins","Wyoming","Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Old Faithful is one of the most important features of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. It is the first geyser most United States folks think about when talking about Yellowstone. Since it is one of the more popular areas there are a number of things to do around the geyser. There are numerous other geysers, a museum, visitor center, and the Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins. The park is very large, which means it can take weeks to see everything a visitor might have traveled a great distance for. Going out of the park and returning each day would be expensive and pointless since there are places to camp and stay within the national park. Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Cabins are just one place visitors can stay. The lodge is open for winter months starting in December and ending in March. The Geyser Grill which is on the premises is also open, and will close in March a few days after the lodge. As the name denotes the lodge is a snow lodge, which means it is not typically open for the off peak times in the park like early spring and autumn. It is instead meant to be a snowy haven for winter travelers looking for a getaway in mountains. While staying at the park tourists are able to take snow coach tours around the Canyon area that also has Lower Falls. Lower Falls is one of the more famous North American waterfalls due to its height. In winter the falls will freeze providing a wonderful winter land photo. There are also ski and snowshoe trails for skiers to experience. For the less experienced visitor there are tour guides to take them out. This lodge is set up as if technology does not exist. They do not have televisions, radios, air conditioning, or internet. The exterior of the lodge is wood siding stained a natural dark, with many eaves and the typical mountain structure of a cabin. The lodge rooms are also western in style with adornments and features. There are full baths and telephones in the rooms. The cabins are either in the west or frontier style. The western cabins were built in 1989 in modules of four. They are furnished with queen sized beds and full bath. The frontier cabins are more duplex in style with simplicity for the decor. The bathrooms are a shower, toilet and sink. The lodging rates will vary depending on the year. The rooms are based on double occupancy, with four people allowed per room. Visitors should expect rates to be $90 to $200 per night depending on the visiting week. Christmas will be a little expensive. There are also winter getaway packages for a minimum of two nights that range from $295 to $910 depending on the cabin of choice. The Geyser Grill is not the only place to get food, but it is on site and the closest. Visitors can return to the lodge each night after a day on the trails."
"Old Faithful","Wyoming","Old Faithful, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Old Faithful is a geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. It is perhaps one of the more well known geysers both due to its name and the hype it receives. However, Old Faithful is not the most regular geyser the park has, nor is it the largest. In the world there are about 1000 geysers and half of them are found in Yellowstone National Park. Old Faithful was named by Washburn-Langford-Doane during an exploration of Wyoming in 1870. It was also the first geyser to receive a name. Old Faithful can be found by taking the main road. It is situated between Madison and Old Thumb, which is also near the Old Faithful Inn and Old Faithful visitor center. Old Faithful creates a spray of 120 feet most of the time. It will erupt about every 80 to 90 minutes. The time can vary somewhat during the year. The park rangers will post the estimated eruption times for Old Faithful at the visitor center. It is best to check with them first before walking out to the geyser. While there are other geysers to see along the path they are not as predictable and may not be erupting during your visit. There is a pave walkway that begins from the parking lot of Old Faithful. This walkway will eventually turn to wood as it goes over marsh type land towards Old Faithful Geyser. The walkway and benches will keep visitors 300 feet from the actual spray when it erupts. It has been suggested by scientists that all geysers including Old Faithful will erupt depending on the annual rainfall the park sees. It is known that Old Faithful has been reliable about eruptions for 135 years, and probably before it was discovered. However, over this period of time the geyser has erupted between 50 and 90 minutes. The most current average at Yellowstone for Old Faithful Geyser is 91 minutes. The scientific research has discovered that all geysers including Old Faithful will vary their eruptions from longer periods to shorter ones depending on the dry and wet periods. It suggests that when the geyser has more water running through the underground plumbing it will erupt more frequently. When Old Faithful erupts it lasts for 1.5 to 5 minutes. This will again depend on the amount of water that is underground and the pressure that builds. The geyser tends to expel 3,700 to 8,400 gallons of water. This water is at boiling temperatures. While the typical eruption height is 120 feet this can also vary. It has been at heights of 106 to 184 feet over the last 135 years. Steamboat Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin is actually the largest active geyser in the world. It is worth a stop for vacationers, and the basin can be found after Madison in the northwest area of the park. Once visitors have taken the pathway around Old Faithful a drive to Lower, Midway, and Upper Geyser basins is worthwhile, as this is an area filled with geysers."
"Old Trail Town","Wyoming","Old Trail Town, Cody, WY","Cody, Wyoming is located at the eastern gateway to Yellowstone National Park. There are many American West traditions in Cody such as Buffalo Bill's Historical Center, Cody Night Rodeo and Dan Miller's Cowboy Music Revue. Another fun thing to visit is the Old Trail Town, which is open from mid May to mid September. The hours of Old Trail Town are from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day. This wonderful attraction contains twenty six buildings beginning with one dating from 1879, with the latest building constructed in 1901. There are approximately one hundred horse drawn vehicles along with Native American artifacts and other memorabilia from Wyoming's frontier days. The Shoshone, Gros Ventre, and Crow Indians are part of the collection of artifacts that the town has on display. While visiting Old Trail Town visitors can learn about famous residents of Wyoming including John Jeremiah'' Johnston, Jim White a buffalo hunter, W.A. Gallagher and Blind Bill who were cowboys that were murdered in 1894. Phillip Vitter was a trapper that was killed by a grizzly bear and he is mentioned in the memorabilia at the museum. Also talked about were the famous outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as well as General Custer and his Crow Indian scout, Curley. The Rivers Saloon was built by Wood River which is west of Meeteetse, Wyoming in 1888. Cowboys, gold miners, colorful western characters and outlaws all paid visits to the Rivers Saloon at some point. If visitors look at the door they will see bullet holes. One of the most interesting cabins on the site is that of the Hole in the Wall Gang. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid spent time in the two room log cabin which was built on Buffalo Creek in 1883. A livery stable that was built in the late 1870's north of Clarks Fork Canyon demonstrates what was needed to keep horses on the move in the American West. The Burlington Store was built in 1897 and features many of the items needed to live on the Wyoming frontier. There is a cemetery at the far end of Old Trail Town Street that has the grave of Jeremiah Johnston who was called Liver Eating Johnston. The movie Jeremiah Johnston was based on this man's life. After you have finished visiting Old Trail Town you can drive a short distance out of Cody going north. This will take visitors to the Chief Joseph Scenic Highway which takes guests through Sunlight Basin and on to Cooke City, Montana. This will also get visitors to the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park. Sunlight Basin is in the Absaroka Mountains where fishermen can try their luck at catching cutthroat trout. If visitors don't want to go to Yellowstone they can turn toward historic Red Lodge, Montana. If they take this scenic route they pass through Beartooth Pass in the Beartooth Mountains. If visitors stay in Cody there are plenty of shopping opportunities, dude ranches to stay at and other attractions in the town."
"Old West Miniature Village and Museum","Wyoming","Old West Miniature Village and Museum","Old West Miniature Village and Museum is located at 140 west Yellowstone Avenue in Cody, Wyoming.

"Osprey Falls Trail","Wyoming","Osprey Falls Trail","Yellowstone National Park is filled with numerous different hiking trails. One of them is Osprey Falls Trail. Osprey Falls is located five miles from Mammoth at the Old Bunsen Peak Road Trail. Osprey Falls Trail is 8 miles round trip, though it does not have a loop. The level of difficulty for the trail is rated at difficult. There are two trailheads for Osprey Falls. Visitors can begin south of Bunsen Peak or north of Bunsen Peak depending on what road was used to enter the national park.   The trail begins on a stretch of road, which is closed to vehicles. The trail will begin level from the south, but as hikers reach Swan Lake Meadows the terrain begins to steepen and becomes switchbacks. For those who start at the north section they will find a small meadow usually filled with birds and waterfowl before entering the steady climb up to the Falls. The beginning of Osprey Falls Trail is actually past Bunsen Peak at Sheepeater Canyon. In this area it is possible to see deer and moose. The rim of Sheepeater Canyon is steep with an 800 vertical drop. The trail will also follow Gardiner River towards the falls, which are 150 feet in height."
"Outlaw Trail","Wyoming","Outlaw Trail","Outlaws devised a method for robbery and rustler in which they could use certain trails to pick up fresh horses. Most consider this the Pony Express method. The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy, and Sundance Kid were all well known individuals who used trails like the Outlaw Trail in Cheyenne, Wyoming to get away from the law. The route of the Outlaw Trail ran from Montana to Mexico with a number of stopping points along the way. Today it is possible to visit parts of these trails when in Wyoming. Thermopolis, Wyoming has an Outlaw Trail Ride which takes visitors to a number of the ranches used as stopping points in a 7 day/ 6 night circular tour.   Much of the trail land is part of private property and suitable only for off road vehicles or horses. Cheyenne's particular stop on the map started in the 1860s along with the town being settled. It was first used as a Union Pacific Camp, and since not too many places existed in the area it was easy for the outlaws to run. Just like in the past it is still possible on some parts of the trail to find fresh horses as part of the tour, as well as supplies for camping."
"Outlaw Trail Ride","Wyoming","Outlaw Trail Ride","When the west was wild and unsettled a number of outlaws would take advantage of the open land. Today visitors to Thermopolis, Wyoming can take a ride along the Outlaw Trail, which was well known in the Old West. The route takes riders over private land. In fact, 90 percent of the trail is privately owned. Permission was granted for a tour group to take visitors on the trail where they can camp. The trail begins in Thermopolis and takes riders through Wild Horse Butte, McCoy Ranch, and Axtel Ranch for a 7 day/ 6 night trail ride.   What makes this Outlaw Trail Ride so important to us is who used it. Butch and his gang, whom most of us have heard of, used the trail. They decided to ride along the route the trail goes on, as well as create quite a stir in Thermopolis. Visitors will visit Little VH, Reichts Ranches, and Quein Sabe as well as the other locations mentioned. These ranches were stopping points for Butch and his gang because fresh horses would be waiting. Also along the trail are old Teepee Rings which were used for buffalo hunting by Native Americans during those early years."

The Mountain-Stag combination is one of the most highly rated courses in the Northwest. The Mountain course features the open, rolling terrain reminiscent of Scottish links-style golf courses. The course also features large greens and 30 good-sized sand bunkers. As a nod to the game of golf's birthplace, the Mountain nine also features a small replica of the famous Swilcan Burn Bridge. On the Stag nine, the course plays to more of a target-golf orientation. Woods and wetlands are the order of the day on this layout, with native rough lining all the fairways and water hazards strategically placed throughout. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the Mountain course include No. 1, where the St. Andrews' replica bridge crosses the fairway just short of the green. This par-4 hole plays to only 350 yards from the Championship tees and features a wide-open fairway. Hole No. 5 is named Goosedubs,'' which means water hazard. This par-4 plays to 420 yards from the longest tees and doglegs left around a boot-shaped lake. The approach shot to an elevated green is the tricky part on this hole, as it requires a carry over the lake to an elevated green snuggled up against the water. Hole No. 8 is named Deil's Creek,'' which translates to the Devil's Fishing Basket.'' A par-3 that plays too 202 yards from the back tees, the hole calls for a carry over a lake to long, narrow green guarded by bunkers left and right. Hole No. 1 (10 overall) on the Stag course begins the journey into the Old West. The shortest hole on the course, this par-4 plays to only 335 yards from the longest tees. It is also one of the most picturesque, as Little Goose Creek runs the length of this dogleg left, while intermittent trees guard both sides of the fairway. The Mountain-Stag combination has received a number of honors and awards over the years, including being ranked among the Best Residential Golf Courses by Golfweek magazine in 2008, and the country's Top 100 Modern Golf Courses in 2009. Practice facilities at Powder Horn include a state-of-the-art driving range and practice facility, as well as a 13,000-square-foot putting green.

"Snake River","Wyoming","Snake River, Yellowstone National Park, WY","The Snake River is one of the longer rivers that run through North America. It is a western river, which goes through Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The river begins in the mountains along the continental divide. Before the Snake River reaches the ocean it merges with the Lewis River. This merger occurs at the southern Yellowstone entrance. The river will flow into Jackson Lake, which takes it through Jackson Hole. Visitors who wish to venture near the river have two national parks they can go to. The Snake River also runs through Grand Teton National Park and Teton County. Snake River is actually considered a tributary of the Columbia River, which is the largest river in North America. It is the Columbia River that brings water from the Snake River to the Pacific Ocean. Along the way the river goes through the Snake River Plain before it reaches the Columbia. The Snake River is only 1,040 miles long. It has a flow of 56,900 cubic feet per second. The plain mentioned above is one of the more interesting features of the river. The plain is mostly in Idaho and was created by a volcanic hotspot, which resides under the North American Plate. The North American Plate also lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, which is why it has half the world's geysers. Geological history shows that flooding as a result of the melting after the Ice Age helped fill the Snake River. The water from the melting snow would form lakes, which eventually spilled into the river in the middle and lower regions. The Snake River eventually created Hells Canyon, the Palouse Hills and other features that can be found along the river banks. The Snake River has a few dams along the way as well, to help regulate the water in Washington and for use as hydroelectricity. Visitors to Yellowstone National Park will find a few trails leading close to the river. The park road will also take visitors along the river at certain points. For visitors who wish to see the river most closely there are trails off the beaten path. Yellowstone has a lot to offer so the Snake River is just one little area to visit. There are plenty of other areas to go in the park for visitors who wish to stay on the regular paths. For example Yellowstone River is closer to the road. It also has a trail that visitors can go along to see Yellowstone Lake, the Canyon, and the waterfalls. The Snake River is an important natural aspect of the national park. There are numerous fish, wildlife and other organisms that use the river. Mammals will come to the river for water and certain animals like bear will come to feed and drink. Conservation is essential to Yellowstone National Park; therefore they work to keep their river systems clean. Fishing on the Snake River in the park is not allowed, but there are other places to fish in the park."

"Steamboat Geyser","Wyoming","Steamboat Geyser, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Norris Geyser Basin is filled with a variety of different geysers in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Norris Basin is located in the northwest of the national park. It is best reached from the west entrance, but any entrance will get visitors there. Norris Basin is near Norris Village and the Museum of the National Park Ranger at the beginning of the upper loop. The road can be closed in winter to reach the basin. Norris Geyser Basin has numerous geysers including Steamboat Geyser. It is the world's tallest geyser at the moment. When it erupts it will reach over 300 feet in the air. Eruptions can last from three minutes to 40 minutes depending on the time of year. When there is more water running through the underground plumbing due to spring runoff or rain water the geyser is taller and will last for a longer period of time. The pressure build up will also help. Unfortunately this geyser does not have a predictable cycle. There have been a variety of eruptions over the years in which some have lasted four days and others a few minutes. The geyser did not have any eruptions between 1911 and 1961. There were some minor eruptions between 10 and 15 feet between 1961 and 1991. When an eruption of water does occur 48 hours of steam will occur after it. Cistern Spring which is near the geyser will actually empty completely as the water is rerouted to the major eruption. This emptiness of the spring does not occur each time, but during the tallest eruptions. Waimangu Geyser in New Zealand was the tallest geyser in the world reaching 1600 feet, but it has been dormant since 1904, which is why the Yellowstone geyser has the world's largest title. Other hot springs in Yellowstone used to be taller; however, like Waimangu these geysers have ceased their theatrics. Visitors who travel to Steamboat Geyser will be at 7,598 feet elevation. The temperature of the geyser is generally 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Eight eruptions have occurred since 1991. The last major eruption was on May 23 2005. The geyser has two vents that are five miles apart, which have steam and water coming out of both. Before visitors can reach Steamboat Geyser they must walk along Norris Geyser Basin trail. The stop before this amazing natural wonder is Emerald Spring. Emerald Spring is so named due to its mineral presence. It will absorb all sunlight but blue, making it reflect that color back. The pool is 27 feet deep with yellow sulfur adding to the blue making it blue. The hot water underground will dissolve the sulfur. After Steamboat Geyser is when visitors will reach Cistern Spring. The spring has a deposit of ?inch of sinter each year. This means it has quite a build of sinter around the edge. Since 1965 the spring has been feeding the forests with silica helping them grow. This can throw off the heat by decreasing thermal activity in certain areas."

The finishing stretch of holes, Nos. 15-18, is said to be as good as it gets. Hole No. 15 is said to be the toughest hole in Teton County,'' a strong par-4 that plays to 443 yards from the tips. This hole features an undulating fairway and a landing area guarded by solitary a tree in the fairway and a bunker on the right. Approach shots must then play to a green bordered on three sides by water and Aspen trees at the back. Hole No. 16 is the signature hole for the course, a par-3 that plays to 202 yards from the back tees. This hole curves around water and tee shots must carry the hazard to a green guarded by several small bunkers at the front a one large bunker at the rear. The finishing hole at Teton Pines is a classic risk/reward hole. A strong par-4, the hole plays to a hefty 472 yards from the longest tees and doglegs right around a water hazard, and golfers must decide how much to shortcut the hole off the tee. Bunkers and trees await errant shots, and second shots must then play to a green guarded by bunkers in front. Since its opening, Teton Pines has garnered a number of accolades, including being named 3rd Best New Golf Resort in the country by Golf Digest, while also receiving acclaim from GOLF Magazine, Zagat Guide, and Condy Nast Traveler, which ranked it at #9 among the Top 100 Golf Resorts in North America in 2004. Practice facilities include a driving range and short-game practice area. The resort also features a clubhouse for dining and relaxing.

"The Merci Train","Wyoming","The Merci Train","The Merci Train was given to the United States by France. At the time it was given to us there were 49 French railroad box cars for the lower 48 American states. Parades in these states were attended by a great many people in order to receive the boxcars and gifts. There were tens of thousands of gifts inside each boxcar gifted to the USA. The French awarded the train for our help in the Second World War. It was also meant as a means to re- solidify our friendship, which began when America gained independence.   In Cheyenne, Wyoming there is one boxcar from the Merci train. On the side it says Train De La Reconnaissance Francaise. The boxcar is not a museum exhibit, but instead located in front of American Legion Number 6 at Lincolnway and Big Horn. On the side of the train are the French and American flags, as well as several different Coats of Arms. The train is closed off by a gate, with lock. This means visitors cannot go inside the boxcar, but can view the outside. It is painted gray with train doors on both sides.

"Three Crowns Golf Club, Casper, Wyoming - a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Golf Course, Built Atop an Old Oil Refinery","Wyoming","Three Crowns Golf Club, Casper, Wyoming - a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. Golf Course, Built Atop an Old Oil Refinery","Three Crowns Golf Club has a fairly unique distinction of being built atop the site of a former oil refinery, and it takes its name and logo from the BP Amoco symbol of crowns of gold, white and red. The land below is said to still contain millions of gallons of refinery product, which is scheduled for recovery over the next two decades. Because of that fact, course architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr. removed 3,000 miles of pipe and 400,000 cubic yards of concrete, then capped the soil with six feet of clean dirt. Lakes were also dug out, and the excavated earth was used to build mounds and other course features that separate the holes from each other. Native grasses, which turn the color of wheat in summer, were then planted atop the mounds. Jones also created a series of raised wetlands that sit above the course to help purify the water. The course also features eight lakes, which come into play on 14 of the 18 holes. There are also 84 sand bunkers that punctuate the layout. The par-72 course, which opened in 2005, plays to 7,065 from the longest tees, and covers 110 acres of manicured turf and 45 acres of native grasses. Kentucky Bluegrass is used for the tees, fairways and roughs, while A-1 Bentgrass is used for the greens, which were built to USGA standards. The course also features generous fairways, and the greens have been described as receptive. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 2. This par-5 plays to 595 yards from the back tees and plays as a dogleg right around a lake. Fairway bunkers guard the landing area off the tee, while mounding protects the left side of the fairway. The fairway narrows considerably on this hole as it approaches the green, which is tucked behind the water and guarded by bunkers to the left and at the rear. Hole No. 4 is one of the most picturesque and challenging holes on the course. This par-3 plays to 210 yards from the tips, with water surrounding the green as it pushes out into the hazard. The finishing hole at Three Crowns is both picturesque and intimidating. This par-4 hole plays to 415 yards from the longest tees, and like many other holes, tracks a body of water all the way to the green. This hole doglegs right around the hazard, and also features a bunker right in the middle of the fairway. Approach shots must then find a long, narrow green tucked right up against the water and guarded by bunkers in the front and rear. Three Crowns also features a clubhouse which is home to a golf shop and restaurant."
"Thunder Basin National Grassland","Wyoming","Thunder Basin National Grassland","Thunder Basin National Grassland is situated between Big Horn Mountains and the Black Hills. The grassland has an elevation of 3,600 feet to 5,200 feet. The grasslands are in northeast Wyoming near the town of Douglas. As another location point the grasslands are found in Powder River Basin. Locals head to Thunder Basin National Grassland for outdoor recreation all year long. Hiking, hunting, fishing, skiing, and sightseeing are all options. Camping is also allowed within the national grasslands, though there are no developed grounds.   Throughout the year wildlife can be spotted in the meadows, near the rivers, and along the trails. Livestock, coyotes, moose, deer, small animals, and birds are some of the wildlife. The land in Thunder Basin National Grassland is federal, state, and private depending where visitors head. The land area is found in Converse, Weston, Campbell, Niobrara, and Crook counties. The Medicine Bow Routt National Forest is also managed by the same forest service office in Laramie, Wyoming as Thunder Basin. There is also a local ranger station in Douglas. Visitors who wish to camp will need to understand wildlife safety, so it is a good idea to stop by the ranger station to discuss camping areas and safety."
"Tower Falls","Wyoming","Tower Falls, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Tower Falls in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming are easily accessed from either of the north entrances. The falls can also be reached by visitors coming in the other entrances, though the drive is a longer one. Tower Falls are about midway between two north entrances near Tower Junction and the Petrified Tree. From Tower Junction the rest of the park can be reached such as Dunraven Pass. Tower Falls is a waterfall with a height of 132 feet and a 20 foot crest. The water from Tower Falls is supplied via Tower Creek. This waterfall is one of the easiest to access throughout the entire park. Other waterfalls of the park are off the beaten path. Nearby the falls is a parking area with an overlook about 100 yards from the parking area. When visitors stop in this area they can also visit the general store in Tower Junction. The trail is a dirt path so maintenance is required, which can cause closures during the year. The falls were created due to volcanic activity in the park many years ago. The volcanic eruptions that made the park created a variety of canyons and crevices leaving behind certain natural wonders like Tower Falls. Around the falls are volcanic pinnacles that add to the beauty. The trail mentioned above is .6 miles to the bottom of the falls where visitors can look up at the cliffs around them and marvel at nature. Thomas Moran in 1872 was the first artist and painter to record falls. His depiction of the falls shows the change to the area that has occurred over the last few years. It is best to take the trail down to the bottom to get a different perspective of the falls. From below visitors may get a glimpse of a rainbow as the sun hits the water. They can also see the cracks and crevices made by the water. Tower Falls, since it is fed by a creek will vary in water discharge. During winter runoff the falls are fuller with water providing a luxurious view. However, by July the water will begin to slack off. Visitors will probably want to see it when it is most full, as will other waterfalls in the park. During spring the plants are also in bloom allowing the trees to frame the water a bit better than in fall when the land looks sparse. To offer more on the trail it is a switch back style. This means visitors will be walking along a steep path with sudden curves to have them walking below the path they were just on. The steep walk requires the right shoes and fitness. The walk is not set up for handicap accessibility. Along the trail visitors will pass by Yellowstone River as well. A camera should be taken along on the journey to record the amazing sites, and for those interested rangers are willing to offer more detail about the falls."

"Two Ribbons Trail","Wyoming","Two Ribbons Trail","Depending on what entrance visitors use to enter Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming there are going to be hikes to take. For example using the west entrance will place hikers near Two Ribbons Trail. Two Ribbons Trail is about five miles east of the entrance and easy to walk. The entire trail has been covered in boardwalks to help visitors get around the various interesting sights which make up the trail. Hikers should expect to see pine, sagebrush, and the Madison River. The river flows through the park and can be seen from a couple of different trails.   This area of Yellowstone is still recovering from the 80s fire that took out quite a bit of trees and brush. Today hiking Two Ribbons Trail will show visitors how the park is healing with small new trees and new brush that is growing. Along the way are also some buffalo wallows. Unlike some of the other trails, this one does not have any interpretive signs. There are a couple of wayside exhibits at the trailhead, but other than that the river is the main attraction. Since the trail has a boardwalk it is also handicap accessible, allowing all visitors to enjoy some hiking."
"Uncle Tom's Trail","Wyoming","Uncle Tom's Trail","Uncle Tom's Trail in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is part of the grander trail for Yellowstone's Grand Canyon. The trail was created in 1898 by Tom Richardson. Five years after the construction Tom led visitors on tours hiking them upstream of the river and over the bridge. Today the bridge has been slightly remodeled and is named Chittenden. Tom then led visitors over a rough trail to the Lower Falls. Even then the tour consisted of a picnic and then a return trip across Yellowstone River.   Since the hiking trail is important to the park and some of the more magnificent sights, it has been changed from the original trail Uncle Tom used. It is still the same strenuous walk into the canyon with a 500 foot drop and 300 stairs, but the inclines have been paved to make it a little easier on those who are hiking. The trail is also part of a larger hike called South Rim. Upper Falls is first on the longer trail, with Uncle Tom's Trail as the second part. It then moves into Artist Point, Point Sublime, and Silver Cord Cascade. The hike is more than 3 miles one way if South Rim is part of Uncle Tom's Trail."

"Upper Geyser Basin","Wyoming","Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Upper Geyser Basin is just one of the basins visitors might wish to tour at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Upper Geyser Basin is between Madison and West Thumb on the main park road. The area includes Old Faithful Lodge, Old Faithful Geyser, and numerous other geysers. Boardwalks and paved trails have been built by National Park rangers to ensure their visitors a safe and easy walk around the various spectacular sites. The hike around all of the geysers and especially to see Old Faithful will require at least 2 hours, although visitors should allow for three to four hours. Upper Geyser Basin is split into two sections: the south and north. Old Faithful Geyser is found in the south section of this basin along with Giantess Geyser, Doublet Pool, Solitary Geyser, Plume Geyser, Beehive Geyser, Heart Spring, Lion Group of Geysers, Sawmill Geyser, Grand Geyser, Crested Pool, and Castle Geyser. Old Faithful is the most well known geyser, which can be discussed in its own article. Instead, concentration will be on other geysers in Upper Geyser Basin. North Upper Geyser Basin has Beauty Pool, Chromatic Spring, Comet Geyser, Splendid Geyser, Punch Bowl Spring, Daisy Geyser, Grotto Geyser, Riverside Geyser, Fan and Mortar Geysers, Morning Glory Pool, and Biscuit Basin Sapphire Pool. Starting in North Upper Geyser Basin visitors can see the Beauty Pool, which has blue water in the center and then micro bacteria along the edge causing a rainbow of colors. Chromatic Spring lends some of its plumbing to the pool, which is the next stop on the walking tour. This spring is one of the earlier springs which will catch overflow of water from the rest of the system. Giant Geyser is worth a stop along the walkway. It was dormant until 1955 when an energy shift occurred underground. It has been active since and in 1997 to the present it tends to erupt every 3 to 10 days. The cone on this geyser is not only large, but it also hits heights of 180 to 250 feet when it erupts. Comet Geyser compared to the other stops on the tour is relatively small, erupting about 6 feet. It is part of the Splendid Geyser system. Splendid Geyser will hit heights of 200 feet, and is considered one of the tallest in the entire park. It is however, unfaithful in its eruptions. Punch Bowl Spring is another wonder of nature in Upper Geyser Basin. It has a sinter lip which gives its appearance of a punch bowl. Steam will rise off the water and microorganisms grow on the rocks offering a delightful array of colors. Just to give an idea of the southern section of Upper Geyser Basin, Beehive Geyser and a few others will be described. On the tour tourists can see Beehive Geyser which will erupt a couple times a day for four to five minutes. There is a narrow cone making the erupted water look like that in a fire hose or spout. Heights can reach 130 to 190 feet for the water. If visitors are lucky they can see a rainbow."
"Warren Air Force Base","Wyoming","Warren Air Force Base","F.E. Warren Air Force Base opened in 1867 as a United States Army Facility. Today it is 3 miles west of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The host unit at Warren is considered the 90th Missile Wing, which is assigned to the Air Force Global Strike Command 20th Air Force. The base was first named after Brigadier General David Russell. Then in 1947 it was renamed for France Enroy Warren. Warren was given the Medal of Honor during the Civil War, at the age of 19. About 4,000 military personnel and 600 civilians work on the base.   The base is 5,866 acres. There are also 220 remote missile facilities spread throughout 12,600 square miles. It is considered one of the 4 strategic missile bases the United States has. In 1862 the Railroad Act of Lincolns set up the plans for the transcontinental railroad, which included getting a military installation on the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Since the base is still being used by the military today it is not possible to get on to it unless you have proper authorization. During Cheyenne Frontier Days the base can be open for the air show. It is held annually in Cheyenne."
"West Thumb Geyser Basin","Wyoming","West Thumb Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park, WY","West Thumb Geyser Basin is one of the numerous stops within Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming visitors might wish to see. The park is spread over several hundreds of acres, and could literally take weeks to explore. West Thumb Geyser Basin is one of the highlighted areas for visitors coming in the south entrance. West Thumb is at the junction where the loop to the east and west entrances converge. It is before Old Faithful when coming from the south. Yellowstone National Park is broken into two types of hydrothermal features: geysers and hot springs. West Thumb is a geyser which means water will rise from underground as it is heated and pressure builds. The water will then shoot from a cone structure, often made of limestone. There are also some mudpots and fumaroles along the way in the park. West Thumb Geyser Basin's walking tour will explain the various Yellowstone features and what makes them distinctive for visitors on the trail. During a walk along the West Thumb Geyser trail visitors will be brought to an overlook of Yellowstone Lake. The lake is the largest one at such elevations in North America. In winter the lake's surface will freeze, so that it appears as a white sheet for miles. In summer the lake can be calm, a little choppy, and very interesting depending on the weather around it. Also on this walking tour is Abyss Pool. The Abyss Pool is 53 feet at its deepest point. It is also a hot spring. The pool can vary from turquoise blue to emerald green based on the depth of the water. The spring was first noted in 1883. Another pool or hot springs can be found on the tour. This one is called Black Pool, named because the pool was actually black in color. The water temperatures were lower than other hot springs allowing the microorganisms growing in the water to turn a very dark green, looking almost black. The temperature of the water rose in 1991, killing the microorganisms. An amazing point along West Thumb Geyser Basin is the Big Cone. The Big Cone is the largest sinter cone, which is also in Yellowstone Lake. Big Cone can be submerged in the lake depending on the water flow of the mountains. Fishing Cone is next on the tour. It is on the shore of the alpine lake. In the past mountain men used the lake to fish, which is why it was named Fishing Cone. This naming occurred in 1870 by the Washburn Expedition. Fishing is sadly no longer possible. In the 1920's and 1930's Lakeshore Geyser would erupt 50 feet in the air. There were also two geyser vents. The smaller geyser vent is typically closed until August each year. West Thumb Geyser Basin has numerous stops for visitors to spend a little time. Other stops along the trail include Seismograph and Bluebell Pools, Thumb Paint Pots, Surging Spring, Ledge Spring, Collapsing Pool, Thumb Geyser, and many others."

"Wyoming State Capital","Wyoming","Wyoming State Capital, Cheyenne, WY","The State Capital Building of Wyoming is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The village became a city with the arrival of the Union Pacific Railroad as it made its way across the United States as part of the Transcontinental Railroad. The crews of the Union Pacific got to Cheyenne in 1867 and they continued westward with the railroad. Cheyenne became the Territorial government in 1869 thanks to the railroad coming to town. The Wyoming State Capital began construction in 1886 when the Ninth Territorial Legislative Assembly authorized it. The cost of the building was not to exceed 150,000. There were five members on the commission that were to select the site of the Capital, purchase the property, select an architect and take care of the bidding process. Then Governor Francis E. Warren selected the members of this commission. A Renaissance Revival style was chosen which is reminiscent of the Capital Building in our Nation's Capital Washington, D.C. The first two courses of the building are made of sandstone which was transported from Fort Collins, Colorado. The rest of the building used sandstone from the quarries of Rawlins, Wyoming. There is twenty four carat gold leaf on the dome of the Capital Building. This dome is visible from all directions when visitors enter the city.

"Yellowstone Lake","Wyoming","Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, WY","Yellowstone Lake located in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is one feature visitors should take the time to see. Yellowstone Lake is at 7,733 feet elevation. The entire lake is spread out over 136 square miles, with 110 miles of shore. The lake will vary in depth, from 139 feet to 390 feet at its deepest spot. Yellowstone has the distinction of being the largest freshwater lake in North America at over 7,000 feet. To reach Yellowstone Lake in the park one can enter through any of the four entrances. The lake lies between the east and south section on the main road. It is between West Thumb and Fishing Bridge. Grant Village Visitor Center or Fishing Bridge Visitor Center is located right near the lake for those who want to learn more about the lake and for recreational purposes. In summer boating and fishing are allowed on the lake; however swimming is not recommended due to the very cold temperatures. In winter the lake will have roughly 3 feet of ice in the coldest spots. Shallow water that covers the hot springs may not have as thick of ice as the rest of the lake, so caution is recommended. It should not be walked on during the winter months. The lake will typically freeze in December and remain so until late May or early in June. Yellowstone Lake is very old considering that Native Americans used to populate the region for the water. Other indications have shown the lake to have existed in pre-historic times. The first European to see the lake was John Colter. John Colter was a trapper in the 1800's. Osborne Russell is another fur trapper who visited the lake in 1836. The lake was often on the path from one area to another for finding fur. David Thompson and William Clark called the lake Yellow Stone, but the name Yellowstone Lake was not official until 1839. During North American history it was suggested that the lake have a dam. This occurred between 1920 and 1937 in which proposals were offered to congress. However, none of the proposals ever made it through, so the lake is untouched by a dam. Geographically speaking the lake has numerous geysers, fumaroles, and hot springs nearby. Walking to the lake is entertaining for visitors due to the variety of flora and fauna, as well as the geothermal wonders. The area around the lake is open to the public. Visitors can see such places as West Thumb Geyser Basin while they tour the lake. The lake was formed when a magma chamber 600,000 years ago collapsed. The water from the north from Hayden Valley and Mount Washburn was able to flow from underground into the Caldera that was formed, eventually filling it and creating Yellowstone Lake. The Yellowstone River also helps feed the lake. The boating allowed on the lake is via powerboats, sailboats, canoes, and kayaks. However, a Yellowstone boating permit is required for anyone who wishes to drop in their boat."
