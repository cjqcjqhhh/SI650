Situated on the Intercoastal Waterway near the downtown area of the city, the gardens and residence are on the National Register of Historic Places and are one of West Palm Beach's most visited attractions. The Norton property, which Ann shared with her husband Ralph Hubbard Norton, is situated on 1.7 acres. The Nortons, who were very environmentally conscious, chose it as a retreat from the hubbub of a fast-growing West Palm Beach and vowed to protect it from being developed. Aside from showcasing Norton's unique works, the gardens also contain more than 300 species of tropical palm trees and various other colorful tropical plants. A combination botanic garden and art museum, the property is operated as a public foundation and is run by an elected Board of Trustees. The mission of the foundation is to preserve Norton's studio and works and to exhibit the works of other artists, especially those from the region. Sculptures are on display throughout the house, gardens, and studio and number more than 100 in total. Nine so-called monumental'' sculptures grace the property around the house. Eight are fashioned from brick, the other of granite. Mr. and Mrs. Norton designed the gardens so that the monumental sculptures are artfully hidden among jungle-like brush, surprising visitors when they come upon each one. Norton, who lived from 1905 to 1982, was considered an avant-garde artist, even though some of her pieces are expressionist or even rather ancient in style. Brick and other heavy materials were favorites of Norton's though she was equally as comfortable with plaster and other similar materials. Throughout the residence, many genres are represented. Throughout the course of the year, Ann Norton Sculpture Gardens hosts a number of exhibits and special events that are open to all members of the general public. Many of them, of course, are art-related and focus not only on Norton's pieces but on the works of other artists who work in a variety of mediums. However, other events that raise money for the foundation are also regular occurrences at the sculpture gardens, including a Halloween masquerade party, a Christmas Festival of Trees, occasional concerts, and an Annual Founders' Day festival. The attraction also celebrates Earth Day with a 3-day event that that touts the importance of preserving open space in urban areas like West Palm Beach. Local school children are also encouraged to visit the gardens year round. In conjunction with curricula offered by the foundation, kids study visual art, history, architecture, engineering, environmental studies and landscape design on their visit to the Ann Norton Sculpture Gardens."

The beach was named after the local and very famous environmentalist name Anne Eaton. It is well equipped with two big parking areas, a shallow swimming area, bathrooms, a long boardwalk and covered picnic areas. In fact, most visitors prefer to hang out along the beach section that is closest to the parking facilities, due in part no doubt to the huge popularity of the beach and the difficulty on hot summer weekends and holidays of finding parking spaces.

The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually.

Bal Harbour Florida is minutes from Miami, on the northern tip of the barrier island called Miami Beach. This area is well known for its rich and famous guests and residents. A bridge links Florida with the island. The island became a masterpiece in the 1920's when Robert C. Graham, Walter Briggs, and CT Fisher owned 245 acres of the land. They decided to develop the island, most particularly the Bal Harbour region. The plans took over 20 years to finish, especially because of World War II. On Bal Harbour there is one of the top fashion locations called Bal Harbour Shops. This shopping area is unlike any other due to the world renowned designers, tropical setting, and innovative creations to be found there. Bal Harbour Shops was started by Stanley Whitman. This was a man with vision. Today three generations of the Whitman family still run the shops, which opened 40 years ago. Stanley Whitman is unofficially retired, yet he still comes to his office each day to help run the company. The architecture of Bal Harbour Shops combined with the landscape offers a garden like atmosphere. The outdoor mall has two floors, with lush foliage native to Florida and the tropics surrounding it. Orange trees grace the second level mall with palm trees on the ground floor. In 1974 the mall changed from the 1965 image to one of European influence. It is during this era that the mall grew its fashion sense with labels like Gucci, Cote D'Azur, and many more. There are future plans to expand Bal Harbour Shops further by adding a third floor, a hotel, and more retail space for the younger fashion shoppers. New stores have been added to Bal Harbour in recent years and months. The stores recently added are 100% Capri, De Beers, DVF, Eie Tchari, Emenegildo Zenga, Custa Barcelona, Barpoint, and Carolina Herrara. These shops just add to the hundred that already exist. A pea in the pod, Addict, Agent Provocateur, Banana Republic, Bottega Veneta, Brioni, Gap,Giorgio Armani, Lacoste, Lora Piana, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Sergio Rossi are a few other shops in the mall.

What more could dog owners and their dogs ask for than a huge swimming pool for pets. The park has one of the biggest doggy pools in the area that is naturally-filtered and contains absolutely no varieties of chemicals. Dogs and puppies can splash about, swim and shake themselves off near their owners for as many hours as they choose. Numerous trees offer shade from the summer heat, as well as perfect places for dogs to mark their territory. Group or individual owners can train their puppies and dogs in one of two yards, or head inside a small enclosure to bath and clean their pets in huge, warm-water and highly elevated type bathtubs. Alternatively, there is an easy to use, rinsing station outside."

"Bay Hill Club & Lodge","Florida","Bay Hill Club & Lodge, Orlando, Florida - The Golf Course Arnold Palmer Loved So Much He Bought It","When a few golfing greats - Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Don Cherry and Dave Ragan - were invited to play Bay Hill in an exhibition match in 1965, Arnold Palmer easily won the match by seven strokes over his nearest competitor, Jack Nicklaus. Mr. Palmer also fell in love with the course - so much so that he eventually purchased it and assumed control in 1976. Since then, he and the club have been dedicated to the philosophy of being the best of the best'' when it comes to golf and all aspects of club life. Palmer envisioned a private-club environment, where the staff and members typically know each other and members receive the sort of amenities they've come to expect. As a result, the club is only open to members and guests staying at the Bay Hill Club & Lodge. Over the years, the Club has continued to grow and be developed. It now sports 27 holes of tour-quality championship golf via three nine-hole courses: the Champion, Challenger and Charger links. The entire club resides upon 270 acres along the shores of the Butler Chain of Lakes. The Challenger-Champion combination plays to 7,204 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.1 and a 139 slope rating. The Charger is the shortest of the three nines, playing to 3,409 yards. One of the most challenging and picturesque holes on the course is No. 6. The hole measures 450 yards tee-to-green, but plays more like 500 yards as the fairway bends dramatically around a large water hazard. A number of alligators are said to inhabit the large pond, making golfers think twice about chancing the water, either from the tee or on their second shot. Bay Hill is regarded as one of the most popular stops for the PGA Tour each year, as the Arnold Palmer Invitational showcases the Club and course. The Invitational makes use of the Challenger-Champion combination, and the course has won numerous accolades. Golf Digest listed the course as #97 among America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses,'' and #14 among the country's Best Public Courses.'' As further testament to its quality and popularity, more than a dozen PGA Tour players have lived in the homes found along the club's fairways, including Scott Hoch and the late Payne Stewart. Bay Hill also provides golf instruction, including 1/2-day, 2-day, 3-day and 5-day packages, along with a New Player'' Academy strictly for beginning golfers. The Bay Hill Pro Shop is also top-notch, featuring a wide array of signature equipment and apparel.

"Bear Cut","Florida","Bear Cut","Bear Cut is part of Crandon Park in Key Biscayne, Florida. It was named after the Florida Black Bear. Within the park there are waterways which lead to the channel. Bear Cut is actually a cut in the land that separates Key Biscayne from Virginia Key. The area separates the Atlantic Ocean from Biscayne Bay too.  It is thought that a hurricane in 1835 was responsible for the land being eroded away in order to create Bear Cut. At the time the land only allowed for a small cut in which the water was four feet deep. The Tequesta People, some of the first natives in the Florida area, lived on the island during this time. The Florida Black Bear was prevalent during this time too. They were known to live in the swamps and feed off of sea turtle nests. Today it is hard to see any of the black bear native to Florida. They were poached for their skins, as well as to provide a safer area to live. As a threatened species they are no longer hunted and can be seen mostly in Northern Florida rather than on Key Biscayne. Bear Cut is used by locals to reach dive spots, snorkel locations, and to enjoy boating around the keys."

"Bird Island","Florida","Bird Island","Bird Island is located in Homosassa in Florida, a unique place where native birds like to rest and migrating birds flock for the pleasure of many birdwatchers. It is a tranquil island where recreation combines with natural preservation to enable birds and people to enjoy the island's beauty without imposing on each other's habitats.

Bird Island is a treasure amidst the beauty of a charming town. Visited by young and old alike, the island is a fun place for exploring, boating and photography. Some people even like the scenery so much that they set up an easel to paint, forever immortalizing the island's picturesque landscapes."

Of course, the uncharacteristic snow eventually melted leaving behind only liquid ice'' and a number of the fastest, tallest, and most exciting ski toboggan runs'' in the world. The winter theme is further underlined and enhanced by such elements as slush-like waterfalls cascading down mountainsides, faux snow-capped mountains, and snowy'' landscapes. There's even a ski lift available to convey park goers up to the top of Mount Gushmore''.

It offers varied programs to enlighten visitors about wildlife, as well as the beautiful geography of the rocks.  The preserve's rocks are a unique and natural tourist attraction. Resting on the edge of the coast, about ten to fifteen feet above the Atlantic Ocean surf, the rocks have been uniquely formed by erosion and weathering. When the tide is higher and the waves more active, the water washes beneath this rocky overhang and with the force of the water, the water is almost spat back out, making what some call a blowing sound. The preserve's blowing rocks are not unique in the world as there are many other examples of such coastal formations. Because of their uniqueness and appeal as a natural form of entertainment, many people, including tourists and residents have spent countless hours sitting above them and watching the whole process. Unfortunately, it became necessary to protect the rocks, which are as susceptible to natural erosion as they are to man-made erosion. As a result, a private firm took it upon themselves to ensure that the appropriate conservation methods were put in place. Blowing Rocks Preserve is open to the public for a nominal fee throughout the year, with the exception of bad weather to ensure that visitors remain safe. It is a wonderful way for visitors to explore the natural wonders that make the state so popular."

Perched atop iron pilings at the extreme southern end of Gasparilla Island is the restored Port Boca Grande Lighthouse and its look-alike companion, which served as the assistant keeper's dwelling. These two pieces of history were almost lost, as by 1970 the sea had whittled hundreds of feet off the southern end of the island and was lapping at the lighthouse's foundation. Fortunately, pressure from local concerns prompted the government to take measures which proved successful in regaining much of the eroded island and in saving the lighthouse so it could be enjoyed by future generations upon generations.   The pretty, two-story, circa-1890 lighthouse once marked the pass for mariners. In recent years it has been restored as a museum that explores the island's fishing and railroad heritage in rooms once occupied by the lighthouse keeper.

"Bonnet House Museum and Gardens Provides a Touch of Old Florida","Florida","Bonnet House Museum and Gardens Provides a Touch of Old Florida","	Fort Lauderdale's Bonnet House Museum and Gardens is a historic property situated on land purchased by early Florida settler Hugh Taylor Birch and presented to his daughter Helen on the occasion of her marriage to Chicago artist Frederic Clay Bartlett in 1919. Construction of the Bonnet House began in 1920 but was stalled in 1925 when Helen died at a young age. The real work on Bonnet House began in earnest again in 1931 when Bartlett married his third wife, Evelyn Fortune Lilly, who had a penchant for decorating. Together, the pair furnished the home with lovely period furniture and exquisite art, and designed and helped tend the beautiful gardens that surround this waterfront property. Though Frederic died in 1953, Evelyn maintained ownership of Bonnet House, finally giving it to the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation in 1983. This move assured that the home and gardens would remain intact, despite huge amounts of development in the greater Fort Lauderdale area. In response to the gift to the Trust and to further insure Bonnet House's integrity, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic places in 1984 and declared a historic landmark by the City of Fort Lauderdale in 2002. However, it remains one of America's 11 most endangered sites.'' When Bartlett considered designs for the house, he was particularly interested in making sure it blended with its subtropical surroundings. The artist shunned traditional Spanish-style Florida architecture and instead chose a Caribbean plantation look with lots of indoor and outdoor living spaces. Inside, the Bartletts spared no expense, purchasing the best-quality furniture of the time period. Visitors will note that all furnishings and accessories on exhibit are original to the estate. The Bonnet House Museum also boasts a fine collection of art work belonging to the Bartletts. The couple, both artists, also decorated their home with their own pieces and many are on display in the on-site Carl J. Weinhardt Gallery. The Trust also holds temporary art exhibits in the gallery featuring works by local and regional favorites. The Bonnet House Gardens are a joy to explore. Five ecosystems can be found on the property so guests who tour them will see examples of Atlantic Ocean beach and primary dune, a fresh water slough, secondary dune (which includes the area where the house stands), mangrove wetlands, and a maritime forest. The orchid showroom, which showcases Mrs. Bartlett's favorite flower, is always full of colorful orchids and is open to visitors. Tours of the Bonnet House Museum and Gardens are available Tuesday through Sunday, departing several times each day. Specialized group tours are available with advance reservations. A small onsite museum shop offers unique collectibles, reproduction paintings, homemade crafts, clothing and jewelry, and books about Bonnet House and South Florida.

Fishing is a popular pastime on the island and many of those who make the trip for camping or hiking also do some fishing. The island is occasionally a party destination and without official clean up crews, things can get a little messy, so watch where you walk. Another downside to the cape is the plethora of mosquitoes. Like most of Florida, the atmosphere is ripe for them, so bring along plenty of repellent. "

Visitors should be aware that there is a modern version of Sloppy Joe's located at the corner of Greene and Duval in the city, but this is not the famed Hemingway bar. During Hemingway's busiest writing years from 1928 through 1938, he spent a good portion of his time at Sloppy Joe's. Hemingway followed the same basic schedule each day, rising at dawn, walking to his pool house, writing until the afternoon and meeting up with friends at Capt. Tony's. During this time he produced some of his more famous works including Death in the Afternoon, To Have and Have Not, The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber and The Green Hills of Africa. Hemingway discovered Sloppy Joe's in 1928, during his first visit to Key West. The owner of the bar, Josie Russel, cashed a royalty check for Hemingway, something the bank refused to do. The two became friends and the rest is literary history. Today, visitors can experience some of Hemginway's world at Capt. Tony's. The bar is also a favorite haunt of songwriter Jimmy Buffet, who mentions Capt. Tony's in at least one of his songs. "

Fly fishing is also possible near the sandbars, especially in the morning when the strait's surface is calm. Sometimes the water is clear enough to see fish moving in schools. Other fish that can be caught at Captiva Pass include flounder, trout, and pompano, especially as the weather gets cooler in the fall. In late October through December and again in March through April, Spanish mackerel are quite common here. Launching boats at Captiva Pass is a bit problematic, as there are not many public ramps available.

"Castillo de San Marcos is a Landmark of American Colonization","Florida","Castillo de San Marcos is a Landmark of American Colonization","	Castillo de San Marcos is a masonry star''-type fort that was built by the Spanish in the late seventeenth century in order to defend the city of St. Augustine, originally settled by the Spaniards in 1565. Maintained by the U.S. National Park Service, the fort is a U.S. National Monument and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a designated Hispanic Heritage Site. Construction of the Castillo de San Marcos was ordered in 1672 by Mariana, Queen Regent of Spain, after Saint Augustine was attacked by British pirate Robert Searle in 1668. Workers were transported from Havana, Cuba to assist in the building of the fort, which took twenty-three years to complete. The material used to build the fort is known as coquina, Spanish for little shells.'' The coquina, shells bonded together with calcite to form a limestone-type building material, was brought to the site from Anastasia Island, now a popular tourist area. It remains the oldest masonry fort in North America and is an excellent example of the centuries-old system of bastion fortification, which included diamond- or angle-shaped formations onto which canons or other artillery were placed. Castillo de San Marcos' claim to fame is that it was never defeated in battle, despite several sieges against it. British canons were said to have very little affect on the walls of the fort, and at times, the entire population of the city stayed safe within the confines of the fortification. The British would eventually assume ownership of the Castillo de San Marcos in 1763 under provisions of the Treaty of Paris. They would rename it Fort Saint Mark. The Second Treaty of Paris gave it back to the Spanish in 1784, with whom it remained until Florida was ceded to the United States in 1819. The name was then changed to Ft. Marion. During the Civil War, the fort was a Confederate stronghold and through the rest of its active duty, Ft. Marion served largely as a military prison. Today, it has become a popular tourist attraction, situated on about 2.5 acres in what is now downtown St. Augustine, Florida. Visitors to the fortress may explore on their own or take advantage of ranger-led tours that depart several times a day and educate visitors on the history of the fort and the culture of the people that fought and were imprisoned there. Re-enactors are a common site at Castillo de San Marcos and often participate in weapons demonstrations and other historic presentations. A video is available for those who desire more in-depth knowledge about the history of the fort. Castillo de San Marcos welcomes up to 2,000 visitors per day during the peak tourist months, which includes the summer and other school holiday times. Because the fort is old and in precarious condition, wheelchair accessibility is not always possible so visitors with disabilities may not be able to tour the entire site."

The beach is accessible from the mainland via Route 60, the Memorial Causeway. Clearwater Beach is part of the city of Clearwater, which was established in 1915. However, Clearwater itself sits on the mainland. Clearwater Beach is wide and welcoming, boasting the powdery white sand that is so indicative of the beaches of the west central Florida coast. Part of a 35-mile-long stretch of beaches that sits between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, this picturesque beach is popular with both locals and visitors and can be quite crowded on the weekends all year long. During, the winter, the area also attracts a large number of snowbirds - visitors from the North - so the population swells and the beaches are busy even during the slightly cooler months. The beach at Clearwater is appropriate for any number of water-based activities, including swimming, sunning, water skiing, jet skiing, boating, and more. The beaches are patrolled by lifeguards so swimming is safe, even for inexperienced swimmers, and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico tend to be warmer and gentler than those of the Atlantic Ocean on the east coast of Florida. Clearwater Beach is also known as a popular beach volleyball location and it's not unusual to see several games in progress at any time of the day. Parasailing is available from the Clearwater Municipal Marina and a parasailing adventure may give visitors a chance to view the many bottlenose dolphins that frequent the Clearwater Beach area. In addition, boat charters and rentals are plentiful at the marina and water lovers can enjoy everything from day-long fishing excursions and dolphin-sighting cruises to sunset dinner trips to adventurous pirate'' cruises for the whole family. The Clearwater Beachwalk, which just opened anew in 2008, was built to revitalize the community and attract new retail and service-oriented establishments to the area, such as shops, restaurants, and hotels. The Beachwalk accommodates walkers, skaters, and bicyclists, and from the Beachwalk, individuals can enjoy the breathtaking sunsets without getting wet and sandy and without traffic obscuring the view. Pier 60, which stretches over Clearwater Beach, also provides additional views of the sunset. The Pier, which has long been an attraction in the area, is excellent for fishing and also hosts a daily festival known as Sunsets at Pier 60, which features entertainment as well as a line-up of artists and crafters who hope to sell their wares to visitors. The festival takes place from about two hours before sundown to two hours after. Other Clearwater Beach attractions include the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, which offers educational programs, marine animal shows, and a chance to interact with the aquarium's friendly dolphins."

After numerous modifications, the new facility was opened to the public in 1981 and included two 65,000 gallon tanks designated for the rehabilitation of dolphins, whales and sea turtles, as well as various exhibit rooms that included fish from the city's original Sea-Orama exhibit. A name change occurred in the 1990s and the facility continued to grow and eventually became a home to many rescued marine animals. Today's Clearwater Marine Aquarium continues to be involved in rescue and rehabilitation and also provides animal shows, a variety of exhibits, and opportunities to interact with the animals that make their home at the aquarium. The aquarium's Rescue, Rehab, and Release program responds to marine animal emergencies in the area, rehabilitates the creatures, and either releases them into the wild if appropriate or allows the animal to remain at the facility.

Visitors can learn more about the aquarium's rehabilitation efforts via a film offered at the facility's Atlantis Theater. In addition, the aquarium's education department also offers hands-on opportunities for the whole family including kids' camps, behind-the-scenes tours with rescue staff and animal trainers, and off-site presentations.

"CocoWalk, Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida","Florida","CocoWalk, Coconut Grove, Miami, Florida","Miami Florida is a large metropolitan area made up of little regions within the city. Coconut Grove is one area of Miami, just east of Coral Gables and West of Biscayne Bay. The township was formed in 1925; however, individuals were in the Coconut Grove area as early as 1825 when the first Cape Florida lighthouse was opened. Coconut Grove certainly has a long history, but it is the present that is important. Coconut Grove is home to the CocoWalk. The CocoWalk is a shopping center unlike most. It is an outdoor shopping mall with numerous buildings and beautiful grounds. It has been referred to as a bayside village with eclectic tastes. The shops and boutiques are filled with high fashion clothing, accessories, and much more. Restaurants line the walk, as well as numerous types of entertainment. Some have considered CocoWalk to be a window shoppers paradise.'' Sidewalk cafes line the streets for tourists and residents who want to soak up the world around them. Bars and other nightlife activities ensure that everyone can have fun even after the shops close. As an outdoor mall there are less shops than you might find in the Bayside Marketplace, a location in downtown Miami. In fact at CocoWalk there are less than forty shops to explore. The retail stores include Azul Boutique, Artway 66, Baby Gap, Coco Cigar, Edward Beiner, FYE Music, GAP, Goldiamor Jewelry, Koko and Palenki, Kouture One, Maui Nix, and Palm Produce.

For example you have holiday events for Christmas, St. Patrick's Day and Fourth of July. There are also events surrounding basketball teams, stores, and restaurants. For guests it is important to look up what events might be coming during the month of their visit to see if anything exciting is going to happen. Artwalks, football events, and even children's events can be found at CocoWalk. CocoWalk is a block from the water and beaches in Miami. It is also not the only place for tourists to have fun if they are visiting Miami. In Miami there is the Villa Vizcaya which was built in 1916. This villa is extraordinary in its architecture. It is also open to the public. For someone who wants to soak up a bit of culture heading to this house before spending a night on the town in CocoWalk is worthwhile.

"Coffins Patch","Florida","Coffins Patch","Coffins Patch is a dive area near Marathon in the Florida Keys. It is an area that is made up of multiple coral reefs, offering a lot of diving opportunity all in one place. The area is comprised of about four miles worth of reef and is located south of Key Colony Beach. Legend has it, the name comes from a ship that sank in the area that was carrying coffins as its cargo. Divers have long looked for the evidence of this ship and its creepy contents, but it has never been found. The area has a plentiful variety of fish that are healthy, not to mention brightly colored and plenty active. The reefs are unmarked and they are not really heavily dived, but it is a popular snorkeling destination. The maximum depth is about 25 feet and the minimum depth is seven feet. Snorkelers can swim in the area and the best part for snorkeling is reportedly the shallow elkhorn forest of about 20 feet worth of space. It is a sanctuary area, so no fishing or lobster fishing is permitted. The Patch is about three and a half miles from Fat Deer Key, which is a Key about midway through the string of islands. "
"College Park is a Pristine Orlando Community","Florida","College Park is a Pristine Orlando Community","	Northwest of downtown Orlando, College Park is an older community that is bounded by Fairbanks Avenue to the North, Colonial Drive to the South, Highway 441 to the West and Orange Avenue to the East. The community is situated around nearly 300 acres of lakes, including Lakes Adair, Concord, Ivanhoe, and Silver. The idea for the subdivision was first announced in 1925 and plans were filed with local authorities. Because many of the streets in the area were already named after famous universities such as Princeton, Harvard, and Cornell, the developers - the CABCO Company - chose to call the subdivision College Park. The community eventually grew to encompass the subdivisions of Edgewater Heights, Concord Park, Adair Park, Ivanhoe Heights, Anderson Park, Dubsdread, Palm Terrace, Ardsley Manor, Biltmore Shores, and Rosemere. Over the years, construction and sales in the area waxed and waned due to the Great Depression and World War II. However, after the war, the housing market in Florida boomed once again and it was during this time that many of the largest homes in College Park were built. Neighborhood amenities were added, including supermarkets, a post office, schools, parks, and even a wildlife sanctuary. Today's College Park is still a quiet community, despite the tremendous growth that has occurred in Orlando during the last 30 years. The area now tends to be dominated by residents of working age, many without children. Many homes have been renovated and carry a fairly hefty price tag, but those awaiting updating are still affordable and are being purchased by young professionals. Those who do have families will find that the community's 3 elementary schools, 2 junior high schools, and 2 high schools (a mixture of public and private) are among some of the best in the city. Ten parks are located within the boundaries of College Park. Some surround the community's many lakes and offer boat ramps for access to the water. Others offer playground equipment, picnic groves, ball fields, basketball courts, jogging paths, or just a place to walk or sit in the shade. College Park also has its own Community Center, public pool, and a public golf course, opened in 1923 but recently renovated. Culturally, College Park is close to many of Orlando's museums and other arts-related attractions. In addition, the College Park Neighborhood Association and the Downtown College Park Partnership play host to a number of different events. Among those events is the annual College Park Jazz Fest, which takes place each November and features concerts under the stars. The yearly Historic Homes Tour is also held each November and during the December holiday season, the community comes together for a variety of holiday-oriented events including concerts, caroling, and much more."

"Collier-Seminole State Park near Naples is a Beautiful Wilderness Area","Florida","Collier-Seminole State Park near Naples is a Beautiful Wilderness Area","	Collier-Seminole State Park, sixteen miles south of Naples, Florida, is one of more than 150 designated state parks located throughout the Sunshine State. Established in 1947, Collier-Seminole is named in honor of two people who were instrumental in creating the history of this portion of southwest Florida. First, the Seminole Indian tribe, which has existed in the Naples area for centuries (with many members remaining today), has left an indelible mark on the area and its culture and is duly honored in the name of the park. Secondly, Baron Collier, a wealthy Florida developer and advertising entrepreneur of the early 20th century, was integral in the development of Rt. 41, the Tamiami Trail, and when it was time to name the park, officials saw fit to honor him. Collier's funds helped finance the road and created new ease of travel between the isolated Everglades region and vibrant Miami. Visitors to the park can view a historic Walking Dredge there, built in 1924 and used to build the Tamiami Trail. The original plans for the area that is now Collier-Seminole State Park was for a national park that would pay homage to Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee. Collier wished to name it Lincoln-Lee Park, but his plans did not materialize. Instead, the state has managed the land since the mid 1940s. Today, the 7,271-acre park is lauded both for its natural beauty and its rich history. The park covers one of three original stands of royal palm trees in Florida, combined with mangrove forest, which is typical of the Everglades region. Geologically, it also overlaps the southwest Florida mangrove swamp with the southern edge of the Big Cypress Swamp. This results in a meeting of salt water and fresh water and of two climate zones, temperate and tropical. The interesting combination of the two results in a plethora of different species of flora and fauna. Nature lovers can explore the park via a 13.6-mile canoe trail that flows down the Black Water River, either on their own or via a guided canoe tour available during the winter months. A boat ramp also accommodates larger vessels for a trip down the Black Water to the Gulf of Mexico. Fishing can be enjoyed on the river or the Gulf. For those who prefer to stay on land, a 6.5-mile hiking trail winds through the cypress and gives visitors a close up look at vegetation. A smaller boardwalk trail, which is handicapped accessible, overlooks the salt marsh and includes interpretive signs. A 3.5-mile off-road biking trail is also available and winds through hammock, marsh, and pine flatwood. Two campgrounds are located at Collier-Seminole States. One accommodates RVs of all sizes and includes 101 spaces. The other is more suitable for pop-up trailers, tents, and vans. They are full-facility campgrounds with hot and cold showers, laundry facilities, and picnic areas with grills. Reservations are suggested. Primitive camping areas are also available on a first-come basis."

"Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary takes Naples Visitors Back to Nature","Florida","Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary takes Naples Visitors Back to Nature","	Originally established to protect one of the largest remaining stands of Bald Cypress and Pond Cypress in North America, Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is managed by the non-profit National Audubon Society, an environmental organization dedicated to conservancy of natural resources in the United States. Located just north of Naples, Florida and east of the town of Bonita Springs, Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary was established in 1954, during a period of extensive logging in the southwest Florida region. The Audubon Society attracted visitors to the area by building a small boardwalk through the swamp and allowing guests to view the region's much-coveted flora and fauna, which was being threatened by over-building. At first, the sanctuary attracted about 10,000 visitors per year, but today, many more individuals visit this natural attraction annually. Corkscrew Swamp now includes a 2.25 mile Boardwalk that takes guests through the park's four distinct environments: marsh, cypress forest, pine upland, and wet prairie. Sanctuary staff is stationed at various places along the Boardwalk and are available to answer questions from those partaking of the self-guided tour. In addition, interpretive signs help identify various flora and other bits of nature. The entire Boardwalk tour takes about 2 hours to complete, allowing time for questions and to linger and enjoy the sights. An optional cut-off shortens the walk to one mile for those who have less time to spend here or prefer not to walk the entire distance of the Boardwalk. Wildlife is plentiful throughout Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary and flora is often breathtakingly lovely, but what guests see will depend on the time of year they visit and the weather. In the pine flatwood area, guests might expect to view woodpeckers, mockingbirds, and perhaps even a yellow rat snack or a Florida black bear. The wet prairie brings beautiful water lilies and other wild flowers as well as egrets and water snakes. Among the bald cypresses, many as old as 600 years, guests will view frogs, owls, turtles, and perhaps an alligator or two. Finally, in the marsh, sawgrass, cattails, and bulrush are common vegetation and animals on hand might include raccoons and a variety of birds. The on-site Blair Audubon Center, where the Boardwalk tour begins, houses the Swamp Senses Media Theater, where visitors to Corkscrew can learn about the population of the sanctuary and others like it. There's also two classrooms for lectures or school field trips, a tearoom with food service counter, and the Nature Store, which offers a variety of nature-related items including books as well as souvenir-type fare such as postcards, tee shirts, jewelry, and more. Admission fees to the Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary continue to support active research programs centered on environmental issues that affect Southwest Florida. The park's excellent research staff also collaborates with professors and students from nearby colleges and with staff from the National Park Service and U.S. Geological Survey."

Riders can experience a rush as they ease along lazily until they get to a large ice type cave. When they enter the cave the true adventure begins, rushing them at high speed beneath a man-made version of Mount Rushmore, known in the park as Mount Gushmore. They speed passed icicles that are really melting. The Creek is a unique ride that takes visitors on a journey from one part of the Disney attraction to the other, an adventure in transportation that varies in speed and catches riders unawares at every turn. The ride lasts between twenty and thirty minutes, leaving behind the entrance way of Melt Away Bay in a fast woop down a sudden watery decline into the river. Cross Country Creek is an adventure in water tubing that many visitors to the Disney attractions refuse to miss. It is a quick way to get from one place to another, but most importantly, it is a crazy adventure that continues to thrill kids well into their adult years."

"Disney's Hollywood Studios Gives Visitors a Taste of Movie Life","Florida","Disney's Hollywood Studios Gives Visitors a Taste of Movie Life","	The third Walt Disney World Resort theme park to be built, Disney's Hollywood Studios opened in May 1989 as Disney-MGM Studios, a pairing between the Disney Corporation and one of the greatest movie studios of the twentieth century. After a long dispute with MGM over the building of a theme park at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, the name was changed to Disney's Hollywood Studios in January 2008 and all ties with MGM were severed. The park is dedicated to the wonders of Hollywood and was originally intended to be a fully-operating television and motion picture production studio. Several movies and television shows were filmed there in the 1990s but all production facilities were eventually moved to Burbank, California. Radio Disney also originally broadcast from Disney-MGM Studios, but moved their operations to Dallas and then to Burbank in late 2008. In the twenty-first century, Disney's Hollywood Studios is much more a theme park than an operating production facility and the park has made a number of changes since its opening. The first thing that greets guests entering the park is the iconic Mickey Mouse sorcerer's hat from the movie Fantasia. Not unlike the castle in the Magic Kingdom and the silver geodesic ball in Epcot, the hat has become the symbol for this Disney Park. Immediately upon entering, guests are transported to Hollywood, courtesy of the replica of Hollywood Boulevard that runs through the center of the park. Actors dressed as budding Hollywood stars and starlets of the 30s and 40s stroll down the boulevard, interacting with guests. The park's first attraction, The Great Movie Ride, sits at the end of the street and takes visitors on a tour of the world's most memorable movies. Also open on Hollywood Blvd. is the American Idol Experience, an interactive stage show based on the popular reality show. More than two dozen attractions, shows, and themed eateries fill the remainder of the park. Many are live shows and tours. Among the most popular are the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular, a long-running, high-energy show that puts guests in the middle of the popular Indiana Jones movies; Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show, with high-flying stunt cars; the Studio Backlot Tour, a chance to view how movies are made; the Voyage of the Little Mermaid, featuring characters from the beloved animated film; and Playhouse Disney Live on Stage, a song and dance extravaganza starring Disney Channel pre-school favorites.	Other attractions include Muppet Vision 3D, Journey into Narnia, and Beauty and the Beast - Live Onstage. For those seeking more interactive adventure, Disney's Hollywood Studios is home to the 4-D ride Toy Story Mania as well as two of the most intense rides in the Disney resort, the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror - a free-fall ride with a Disney twist, and Rock `n' Roller Coaster, an indoor dark coaster with twists of its own. Dining at Hollywood Studios is nearly as much fun as the rides and attractions. Guests can eat at the 50's Prime Time Caf,, where pushy waitresses dressed like Mom will be sure diners eat all their peas; or they might choose the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater, where visitors dine in makeshift cars while watching a sci-fi flick on the massive screen at the front of the restaurant. Additional restaurants and concessions are also available. This park, like all Disney parks, also hosts a daily parade, which changes occasionally. At night, Hollywood Studios comes alive with the presentation of Fantasmic, a 26-minute hydrotechnic and fireworks spectacular that includes awesome special effects and characters from favorite Disney movies, including plenty of villains. A crowd of up to 10,000 gathers in a specially-built amphitheater for the show, which is presented at least once per night."

"Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens Home to Several Florida Teams","Florida","Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens Home to Several Florida Teams","	Opened in 1987 in the city of Miami Gardens, Florida, Dolphin Stadium has long been the home field of several of Florida's most notable sports teams and has been the site of several championship games. Ground was broken for Dolphin Stadium in 1985 and the structure was completed in a little less than two years for a cost of approximately $115 million. The architect for the project was HOK Sport, which has since designed numerous NFL and MBA stadiums across the country. Dolphin Stadium was the first in the NFL to be built entirely with private funds. The campaign to raise money was led by then-owner of the Miami Dolphins, Joe Robbie. The stadium was named for Robbie from 1987 until 1996 and then changed to its current moniker. It is believed, however, that the name of the stadium will change again around 2010, probably to the name of a corporate sponsor. Though the stadium was originally built as home to the NFL Miami Dolphins, Robbie requested a wider playing field so that the facility could also accommodate soccer and the proposed MLB Florida franchise, which was yet to be named but would later be dubbed the Florida Marlins. The Marlins would play their first game at Dolphin Stadium in April 1993. Several millions of dollars was spent to upgrade the stadium during the two years before the team arrived in order to make it more suitable for baseball. The stadium also plays host to the Miami Hurricanes, a collegiate football team belonging to the nearby University of Miami. The team used to play at the Orange Bowl but has played at Dolphin Stadium since the start of the 2008-2009 season. Dolphin Stadium seats nearly 75,000 patrons for either football or soccer and 38,560 for baseball. Players play on natural grass and fans are entertained by the 50 foot- high by 140 foot-wide scoreboard, the largest in professional sports. Plenty of premium seating is available within the stadium. The Club Level includes the Executive Suites and the prestigious Legends Suite. In addition, The Field Club, the newest premium seating option at Dolphin Stadium, includes front row seats, a private entrance, private lounge access, beverage service, private restrooms, and access to the Club Level. The Hall of Champions, a mega-suite'', accommodates up to 150 guests. The food and beverage service in The Club is quite extensive, and concession stands for those in the regular seats are also diverse, ranging from typical ballpark fare like hot dogs and pizza to local specialties such as Cuban sandwiches. A large merchandise store is also located inside the stadium and sells items pertaining to all the home teams. When scheduling allows, Dolphin Stadium also plays host to other events, including the annual Orange Bowl, which was moved here after the demolition of Orange Bowl Stadium in 2008."

The early history of Espanola Way is rather colorful. In addition to being home to many of Miami's finest, in the late 1920s, it also served as a gambling destination for some of the U.S.'s most notorious bad men - like Al Capone - who played at the Clay Hotel, and later became an area where folks would gather to dance to the beat of the music of Cuba and South America. Unfortunately, as other parts of Miami and Miami Beach began to experience a period of decline in the 50s and 60s, so did Espanola Way.

Miami Beach's Espanola Way is now best described as Bohemian in nature. Not your typical retail shopping area, this Historic Spanish Village is home to a variety of small vendors peddling their unique wares including one-of-a-kind handmade jewelry, apparel by local designers, kitschy accessories, and much more.

Art galleries are many as well and feature works by not only local and regional artists but also nationally- and internationally-acclaimed artists in a variety of different genres.

"Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden is a Coral Gables Favorite","Florida","Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden is a Coral Gables Favorite","	The Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden is an attraction located in Coral Gables, Florida, a suburb southwest of Miami. It is the mission of this garden to save tropical plant diversity by exploring, explaining and conserving the world of tropical plants.'' The garden staff strives to educate visitors as to the bounty of the tropical world and hopes to promote a love for plants and gardening in general. The gardens are named for Dr. David Fairchild, a plant explorer who traveled the world around the turn of the twentieth century to find plants that would be of use to the American public. He was responsible for bringing mangos, nectarines, dates, horseradish, and a variety of other plants and trees to the U.S. He retired in Miami in 1935 and shared his vast knowledge with his friend Colonel Robert H. Montgomery, who founded the gardens and named them after Fairchild. Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden opened in 1938 on 83 acres just south of Miami. The landscape architect for the project was William Lyman Phillips, a partner of Frederick Olmsted Law, who designed New York's Central Park and many other notable green areas. All the plants, palms, fruit trees, vines, and flowering trees are arranged taxonomically throughout the botanic garden. That means they are organized by classification according to their presumed natural relationships. Many of the plants have been collected from the wilds while others, especially endangered species, have been cultivated. The gardens hold a number of special events that highlight specific portions of their collection. These include the International Mango Festival, which takes place each July. There is also a 2-acre rainforest, the Richard H. Simons Rainforest, which was opened in 2000 and features rainforest plants from throughout the world but especially from the American Tropics. It features wide pathways for easy access, there are labels on the plants so that visitors can understand what they're viewing, and a stream with cascades and waterfalls meanders through the forest. In addition, the William F. Whitman Tropical Fruit Pavilion welcomes visitors to experience some of the world's most exotic fruit varieties. A trip to this pavilion can sometimes be a hands-on experience, with a chance to touch and sometimes taste these unusual varieties. Inside the 16,000-square-foot Windows to the Tropics conservatory, visitors view 1,900 species of plants from the humid tropics. Exhibits are arranged by themes and here visitors can enjoy some very rare orchids, bromeliads, and vines. For those who enjoy palm trees, the Montgomery Palmetum is an award-winning display and research collection of palm trees from around the world. The Lisa D. Anness Butterfly Garden is home to about 30 species of the winged creatures, and the 8-acre Arboretum displays more than 700 varieties of tropical flowering trees, which are truly a magnificent site when in bloom. Other exhibits profile cactus, plants of the Florida Keys coastal habitat, and the spiny forests of Madagascar. Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden offers non-credit and credit programs for adults interested in botany and horticulture, daily and summer camp programs for kids, and opportunities for volunteering. The onsite Center for Tropical Plant Conservation works to avoid the extinction of certain tropical plant species and employs a number of plant specialists that work both at the gardens and in the field.

"Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport - Fort Lauderdale FL Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport","Florida","Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport - Fort Lauderdale FL Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport","For the geographically challenged and trivia minded, the Hollywood in the name of the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport refers to the nearby community in Florida. It has nothing to do with the other Hollywood, although the airport was prominently featured in Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise. Rather, the airport was built on an old golf course that was between several communities at the time, and has been through several name changes before landing on its current moniker. Yet what's in a name when you are one of the fastest growing airports in the country? The four terminals are home to an equal number of low-cost carriers, and the growth in that industry has been steadily increasing customer traffic. Additionally, the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport gives travelers easy access to Port Everglades. Many who are taking Caribbean cruises can find good air + transfer packages through the airport here. The airport is also extremely popular with charter flyers. As a result of the large numbers of private pilots who use the airport, Fort Lauderdale became the first airport to levy a usage fee on all incoming flights, including those by private pilots. This has not dimmed the popularity of the airport, however, and talks are underway to possibly add or at least extend one runway starting sometime late in 2009 when plans get final approval from the FAA. Transportation to and from the airport is available from Broward Country Transit Route 1. This line connects with the Tri-Rail and Aventura in Miami-Dade county. A number of private shuttles and buses are also generally onsite from hotels and cruise companies - travelers may want to ask ahead if they book a hotel about pick up options. Short and long term parking options are available, although carpooling and use of the cell phone lot are encouraged."

"Hemingway Home and Museum a Key West, Florida Must-See","Florida","Hemingway Home and Museum a Key West, Florida Must-See","Ernest Hemingway's long presence in Key West has always had a profound effect on the town that sits at the end of the Florida Keys, and the author and his second wife Pauline remain among the most favored past residents of the town. Visitors who wish to explore the life of Ernest Papa'' Hemingway may visit the residence where he and Pauline lived throughout the 1930s. Purchased for the couple by Pauline's wealthy uncle in 1931, the house on Whitehead Street in Olde Town Key West became the Hemingway Home and Museum in 1964, three years after Hemingway's death in 1961. The author, who divorced Pauline in 1939, had spent much of the 1940s and 1950s living in Cuba but visited his Florida home frequently. The Key West property was later sold to Mrs. Bernice Dickson, whose family continues to oversee the museum and grounds. The home, built in 1851 by marine architect Asa Tift, is Spanish Colonial in style and is made from native rock that was garnered from the site on which the house sits. Inside, much of the furniture used by Hemingway, his wife, and his sons Patrick and Gregory still remains a part of the home. Much of it was purchased during the Hemingway's stay in Europe as well as on Papa's trips to Africa and other locales. Visitors can admire ornate chandeliers and other decorative pieces as well as a number of works in Hemingway's extensive collection of art, though some originals have been sold to museums and replaced with replicas. The home was also the first in Key West to have a pool, built in the 1930s for the cost of $20,000. At 65 feet-long, it remains the largest residential pool in the town. Inside this Key West, Florida home is where Hemingway did much of his best writing, including the penning of the books A Farewell to Arms, Death in the Afternoon, Green Hills of Africa, To Have and Have Not (about Depression-era Key West), and For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is said that the author would spend his mornings writing and in the afternoon would explore the town with his many friends, who were known as the Key West Mob. He was a huge fan of deep sea fishing and made many trips to Cuba, Bimini, and the Dry Tortugas with his friends to practice his favorite sport. The Hemingway Home and Museum is also home to approximately 60 cats, many of them descendants of Hemingway's famed 6-toed cat, an animal which was presented to the author by a sea captain friend. The museum feeds and cares for the cats, most of whom bear names of other famous individuals. Tours of the Hemingway Home and Museum are available 365 days a year and are guided and narrated by a group of colorful locals who know everything there is to know about the house, the cats, and the author."
"Henderson Beach State Park in Destin Showcases the Natural Side of the Emerald Coast","Florida","Henderson Beach State Park in Destin Showcases the Natural Side of the Emerald Coast","	Located just east of Destin on U.S. 98, Henderson Beach State Park was established in 1991 after the land for the park was purchased from the Henderson family in 1983. It was the first acquisition the state of Florida made under the newly-formed Save Our Coast program, which had been initiated in 1981 by then-governor Robert Graham. The centerpiece of this park is the expansive white-sand beach that provides a variety of different experiences, from swimming and sunning to dolphin watching and shelling. Swimming is indeed permitted at Henderson Beach State Park but lifeguards are not provided. However, swimming safety flags are posted each day in order to help visitors determine whether or not they should swim. In 2001, volunteers helped build a 3/4 acre nature trail at Henderson. The trail winds through a number of different kinds of vegetation including sand pines, scrub oaks, and dune rosemary, also known as coastal scrub. The trail climbs the park's gently sloping dunes and to the top of a particularly high dune that is the remnants of a bunker built decades ago when the military made use of the area around Henderson Beach. This vantage point provides great views of the park and the Gulf of Mexico. Bicycles are permitted in the park but only along the one-mile-long paved road that circles the expanse. In-line skating areas are also provided in particular portions of Henderson Beach State Park. Visitors are encouraged to pack a meal and use the park's two picnic pavilions to enjoy their lunch or dinner by the Gulf of Mexico. Barbecue grills are provided near the beach boardwalks and are available on a first come, first serve basis. Pavilions may not be reserved during peak tourist season but may be reserved in advance for any day during the remainder of the year. Surf fishing is permitted at the park with the proper license. Anglers can expect to catch pompano, flounder, catfish, redfish, whiting, and a few other species. A bail and tackle shop is located just outside the park. Camping has been popular at Henderson Beach State Park since it opened in 1991. A full-facility campground offers 60 well-maintained campsites that can accommodate either tents or RVs. Both back-in and pull-through sites are available. Water, electricity, picnic tables, ground grills, and clotheslines are located at each site and climate-controlled bath houses feature hot showers and laundry facilities. Each campsite also has its own fire ring and a playground is also located nearby. Campers have separate access to the beach via a short boardwalk. Henderson Beach State Park also sponsors occasional ranger-led programs for visitors of all ages, including special volunteer days when locals and visitors can help maintain the cleanliness of the park and its beach."
"Henrietta Marie","Florida","Henrietta Marie","The Henrietta Marie is an English merchant slave ship, located in Key West and a part of the rich maritime history of the area. In the year 1700 the ship sank 35 miles west off the coast of Key West. Just before the sinking, the ship has sold 190 Africans in the country of Jamaica. The shipwreck was discovered by Mel Fisher's in 1972. The divers were able to partially excavate the wreck and the remaining excavation was not completed until 1983. Archaeologist David More participated in the event with Fisher and, knowing they would find no treasure, still expected the shipwreck to reveal a great deal about the history of the area. At first, they did not fully comprehend what they had found. The ship was different because instead of the one or two sets of shackles found on most ships, there were a large number on board. Usually, the shackles were used to punish sailors, so rarely were more than a single pair needed. There was also a ship's bell discovered. It was cast bronze and encrusted with concrete, sediment, coral and sand. The bell featured the name of the ship etched in block letters. They were able to trace it to the Jamaican shipping returns and realized they had found a slave ship. Fisher donated the artifacts found on board to the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and it is still viewed as the world's largest source of tangible objects from the early days of the slave trade.

"Heritage Plantation Golf and Country Club","Florida","Heritage Plantation Golf and Country Club, Laurel Hill, Florida - a Florida Golf Course Reminiscent of Pinehurst and Southern Pines","The first things golfers notice about the Heritage Plantation course are its exciting changes in elevation and the gorgeous wetlands that serve as buffers. The course is nestled amid a nature preserve and wildlife sanctuary not far from the pristine, white-sand beaches of Destin and Florida's Emerald Coast. The course was designed by the highly regarded course architect Bill Bergin, and was voted the 5th Best New Public Golf Course in America by Golf Digest magazine. The design features 125 feet of natural elevation changes, lush fairways that wind through natural wetlands and pine-laden preserves, along with TifEagle putting greens that meet the highest golfing standards. While the course is reminiscent of some of the world-famous courses in North Carolina's Sand Hills region (such as Pinehurst and Southern Pines), it's also one of the most unique golf courses in Florida and one of the highest-rated courses in the country. The Bergin design and the natural topographical features of the area deliver a course that challenges expert golfers to make use of every club in their bags, while also providing beginning golfers with an enjoyable experience. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a lengthy 7,328 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 133. From the White tees the course is significantly short at only 6,333 yards. Some of the more noteworthy holes include #3, a par-4 that plays up to 448 yards from the gold tees. This is possibly the most picturesque holes on the course, as the fairway descends and then stops abruptly at a sizable wetland crossing. Hole No. 5 is also one of the most challenging and noteworthy, as golfers must play up to the top of a ridgeline landing area and then descend down the most dramatic elevation change on the course toward the green. From the top of the ridge, long-hitting and adventuresome golfers will try to challenge another wetland crossing that guards the putting surface. Hole No. 8 is not especially long for par-3, but it's Heritage Plantation's version of an island green.''  Hitting this peninsula, which is almost completely surrounded by wetlands, is a must for any golfer hoping for par or better. Practice facilities include an expansive driving range - with private tee boxes for members - practice putting green, chipping green, and bunker. PGA instruction is also available, including individual and group lessons. For dining and relaxing, the course features a 10,000-square-foot clubhouse/welcome center. The Plantation Grill offers breakfast and lunch daily, and is known for its famous Reuben & Homemade Soup special, as well as its Basil Wraps and salads.

"Higgs Beach African Graves","Florida","Higgs Beach African Graves","The Higgs Beach African Graves is a small graveyard located next to the Key West Garden Club and the West Martello Tower. The graveyard was originally the final resting place for approximately 300 slaves. They were brought to the island from West Africa, but within three months of arriving, most of them had died. The conditions were so terrible on the boat ride over, they were sick before they had disembarked. They were buried in this area because this part of the island was unused in 1860. The cemetery is a small memorial to one of the most unpleasant periods in United States history. The location was chosen as the site for one of the two Martello Towers, constructed to protect the island during the Civil War. It can be a bit of a challenge finding the cemetery if you are using a map. It appears on older maps, but in order to locate it today, one must view an old map and a new map, comparing the two until you are able to locate the cemetery based on modern landmarks. There has been some talk of excavating the graves, but due to the sanctity of the area, this is unlikely to ever happen. "

Jacksonville Stadium made history when it became the first new stadium to have its inaugural game played by a brand new team. Originally, the stadium was built to replace the old Gator Bowl Stadium. Parts of that old stadium were used to build the new stadium, which was complete in less than 20 months - faster than any other major sports stadium in the United States. When watching a game at Jacksonville Stadium, fans have a number of seating options. The Luxury Suites have some of the best seats in the house for fans willing to pay a little extra. Suites are available for just a single game, or they can be purchased for the entire season for extra benefits. Suite ticket holders have access to special lounge areas, can park in the VIP parking lot, and are able to order food via the suite attendant during the game. Each suite comes complete with a sliding glass window, telephones, a wet bar, private restrooms, televisions, and a lounge area with tables and chairs. Another special seating option is the MPS Group Terrace Suite, which is an 18,000-square-foot structure located at the south end zone. With the MPS Group Terrace Suite rental, fans have access to three private bars, complimentary food and soft drinks, free draft beers and house wines, 30 flat-screen televisions, and padded outdoor suite seats on a private veranda. Seats purchased on a long-term basis give ticket holders the right to personalize their seats with a name and purchase tickets to other stadium events before they're open to the general public. Fans who intend to go to as many home games as possible may also opt to join the Crown Royal Touchdown Club, which gives ticket holders access to seating in one of the two 60,000-square-foot private club areas. Club membership comes with access to bar and restaurant areas in the club section, lounges with 40 televisions showing replays or other NFL games, and a complimentary membership to the nearby North Hampton Golf Club.

Today, the park attracts thousands of visitors each year, many of whom stop at the state park on their way from Miami to Key West, located at the end of the archipelago. Most come to snorkel or scuba dive in the warm waters off Key Largo. The water is suitable for both all year round, averaging 70 to 75 degrees even during the colder seasons of the year.

"Jungle Island a Long-Time Miami Visitor Favorite","Florida","Jungle Island a Long-Time Miami Visitor Favorite","	Originally known as Parrot Jungle, Miami's Jungle Island had its start in 1936. Founded by Austrian immigrant Franz Sherr, the attraction started with just a handful of macaws and a 20-acre location just south of Miami. Early visitors paid 25 cents each to visit the site, which Sherr rented for $25 a year, and were treated to a personal tour by the owner, who educated visitors about the birds and the flora of the Miami area. The Jungle Island of today is now home to about 1,100 tropical birds and approximately 2,000 species of plants, flowers, and trees. In 2003, the attraction made a move from its original location south of the city to a spot on Miami's man-made Watson Island, accessible via the Rickenbacker Causeway. The site is larger and accommodates more visitors but critics say it is not as natural a setting as the original acreage among the hammocks and coral rock. Admission to Jungle Island allows visitors to enjoy a number of shows, exhibits, and other activities. The Winged Wonder show is one of the most popular with visitors and features the creatures that gave Jungle Island its start. The presentation includes a large variety of birds, from friendly parrots, macaws, and bicycle-riding cockatoos, to menacing-looking creatures such as hawks and vultures. Gator X-treme showcases Jungle Island's crocodilian creatures. This aquatic adventure pits man against alligator is a show that usually has visitors clutching their seats in anticipation. Lastly, the long-running Tale of the Tiger showcases the attraction's mammalian residents, including tigers, panthers, leopards, cougars, and ligers. Jungle Island's primates also join the show. At the center of the attractions jungle population is a 20 foot-long, 2,000 pound crocosaurus known as Hank. This animal is the largest crocodilian in the world and was brought to Jungle Island from a farm in Thailand. In addition to birds, mammals, primates, and reptiles, visitors can also find a number of fish ponds located throughout Jungle Island, usually showcasing koi and other similar varieties of fish. Staff also allow visitors to view (and sometimes participate in) the feeding of the animals and birds. Jungle Island's trees, plants, and flowers are also fascinating to view. Many are native to the area while others have been imported from different parts of the world. Most are marked with small placards that help guests identify them and some park staff members are well-versed in horticulture and botany. When visitors are through with shows and exhibits, they can visit Jungle Island's large Hippo Slide, which operates both wet and dry, depending on the season and the temperature. The 168-foot beachfront slide accommodates visitors of all ages. General admission tickets are good for all attractions.

"Lincoln Road was Once the Fifth Avenue of Miami Beach","Florida","Lincoln Road was Once the Fifth Avenue of Miami Beach","	The idea for Miami Beach's Lincoln Road was originally devised by early developer Carl Fisher, who believed that fashionable Miami Beach needed an upscale shopping area that would rival the likes of New York City's Fifth Avenue and L.A.'s famous Rodeo Drive. Indeed, the shops along ritzy Lincoln Road quickly became the stomping ground of the area's rich-and-famous, especially during Miami's heydays of the 1930s-1950s. It was the place to shop and to be seen for anyone who was a member of Miami society. However, like most of Miami Beach, the area took a nosedive throughout the 60s and 70s, becoming drug- and crime-ridden and no longer attracting a desirable clientele. Urban regentrification brought Lincoln Road back to life in the late 80s and early 90s and, today, the area of Lincoln Road between Lenox Avenue and Washington Avenue is a lively urban pedestrian mall that still attracts well-to-do Miami residents but also plenty of visitors of all social and economic classes. Roller bladers are just as common as those exploring the area on foot and while there is still an upscale feel, some people describe the road as more Bohemian in nature. Lincoln Road is not a typical mall but rather a funky outdoor shopping area with a huge assortment of shops and eateries. Visitors who stroll along the avenue will definitely find some of their favorite chain stores here but can also enjoy a variety of one-of-a-kind, privately-owned shops that sell unique wares, ranging from clothing and shoes to jewelry and candles. Well-known upscale shops and stores that sell designer labels are also commonplace along Lincoln Road. Book stores and coffee houses - or combinations of the two - welcome guests to sit and enjoy a cup of java and a good read. Ice cream parlors peddle premium ice cream and Italian gelatos. Restaurants are many and very diverse, featuring a large variety of international cuisines for all tastes. It's not unusual to find a German beer house a few doors away from a Spanish tapas bar or a sushi restaurant. Also, thanks to the pleasant Miami Beach weather, many of the cafes and restaurants offer both indoor and outdoor seating, the latter ideal for people watching, which seems to be a favorite pursuit along tony Lincoln Road. Art galleries are many as well and there's an overall artsy feel to the Lincoln Road shopping area. Street performers are common and the area's most colorful characters seem to frequent this pedestrian mall. The street is a favorite of Miami's gay community and some of the establishments cater to the gay population in particular, though they certainly welcome all customers. Several clubs with live music keep the action going all night long. Most are the ultimate in Miami Beach chic and attract the young, hip, well-to-do crowd that so often frequents the South Beach area."
"Lion Country Safari","Florida","Lion Country Safari - Loxahatchee, Florida - drive-through and walk-through safari with exotic animals","Located in southern Florida, the Lion Country Safari is like an Africa safari experience. Guests can choose a drive-through or walk-through course, and both experiences put visitors into close contact with exotic animals from around the world. The zoo was opened in 1967 by a group of South African and British immigrants who wanted to bring the adventure of a safari to the common person, who would not typically have the money to travel to Africa. It remains one of the most popular attractions in the West Palm Beach area. With over 900 animals, guests can really feel like they're on a safari when then visit the Lion Country Safari.

The Ruaha National Park area is home to antelope, impala, and aoudads. Located in the southwest, the Kalahari Bushveldt also serves as home to some beautiful specials of antelope, such as the Nile lechwe and gemsbok. In the Gir Forest, visitors to the zoo can see water buffalo, nilgai, and blackbuck. The Gorgongosa Reserve is one of the most popular areas, with African lions, and the Serengeti Plains area is also extremely popular, as it is home to the African elephant, ostrich, wildebeest, and other unique animals. Lastly, at the Hwange National Park area, visitors can view white rhinoceros families, zebras, giraffes, gibbons, and chimpanzees. For guests who would rather walk around the preserve than drive through the different areas, there are walk-through paths in Safari World. The zoo has birds, reptiles, and mammals for visitors to see. Some of the most popular birds include the yellow headed Amazon, the macaw, the Caribbean flamingo, and the East African crown crane. Popular reptiles at the zoo include turtles, pythons, alligators, iguanas, and skinks.

The island can only be reached from the mainland by boat or seaplane and visitors will have to anchor offshore and reach the island beach on small boats.

"Little Haiti","Florida","Little Haiti","Little Haiti is located in Miami, Florida, once known to locals as the Lemon City. Today it is a haven for Cuban immigrants, new and old, sitting in a small area where restaurants, showrooms and art galleries dominate the scene with Cuban wonders.  The area is the center of Francophone and Creole cultures.

"Little Palm Family Theatre","Florida","Little Palm Family Theatre","Situated between West Palm Beach and Pompano Beach, Boca Raton is one of South Florida's most beautiful towns. Among its past and present residents are Iron Maiden drummer, Nicko McBrain, and prolific tennis player Andy Roddick. Despite being home to just 20,000 people, its recent historical and political importance is certainly notable: it was the site of the first anthrax attack in the USA in 2001, and is also a famous liberal stronghold, with over 60% of its votes polled for John Kerry in 2004. However, hidden underneath all of this is the Little Palm Family Theatre, a wonderful and widely applauded community theatre which is completely run by volunteers.   The idea underlying the community theatre is a popular one: all participants are amateurs; however the players are generally respected as highly as their professional thespian counterparts. The heart of the ideals enshrined in the tradition of community theatre is that it provides a forum for a wide array of amateur or aspiring artists to practice their art in a public space that everyone can access. Boca Raton's Little Palm Family Theatre has been heralded for doing exactly that in a small Florida town where theatrical opportunities may be harder to come by than its big cities."

The zoo houses actually house a number of rare species, which cannot often be viewed at other zoos. Parent's Magazine voted the Lowry Park Zoo as the top zoo in America. The zoo is divided into a number of sections to help maximize guests' self-guided experience. In the Safari Africa area, guests can see the Ituri forest, full of natural wildlife. In the Wallaroo Station, guests can see animals like cockatoos, kookaburra, goats, and of course, kangaroos. At the Asian Gardens, guests can see leopards, tigers, and bears, and at the Free Flight Aviary in this section, guests can enter a sub-tropical rain forest where they can enjoy the feathered friends who live there. There is also the Florida Boardwalk, where guests can see the animals who live naturally in Florida, and the Manatee and Aquatic Center, that is home to many endangered and amazing marine animals. One of the most popular areas of the zoo is Primate World. In this area, guests can see monkeys, mandrills, and orangutans, as well as chimpanzees and gorillas. Also included are tiny marmosets and tamarins. Nearby, visitors can go to the Birds of Prey exhibit, and see a Spirits of The Sky Show, which features a number of large birds, any of which are native to the United States and Florida in particular. Because the weather in Florida is warm year-round, the Lowry Park Zoo's animals don't have to be housed in special facilities for the winter. This gives guests more opportunities to see the animals, including a number of species that naturally live in rain forests, deserts, and other hot environments. Keep in mind, however, that some zoo animals are moved to their indoor living spaces later in the day, and others may not be outside during the hottest days of summer. The zoo has a number of special events throughout the year to help visitors get a behind-the-scenes look at some of the animals housed at the zoo. Every summer, there are camps for children of all ages, and you can also schedule a VIP tour or an EcoTour to get a guided experience while visiting the facility. They also sponsor sleepover events so that families can see the animals after hours. Many animals are more active at night, so this gives visitors a unique experience. The Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa, Florida is open every day of the year, except for Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. During some periods of inclement weather, or other circumstances, the zoo might close, so it is always a good idea to call ahead to make sure the zoo is open for visits.

"Lubee Bat Conservancy - Gainesville, Florida- bat research and education facility","Florida","Lubee Bat Conservancy - Gainesville, Florida- bat research and education facility","Florida has a wide assortment of zoos and nature preserves, and some of them are more specialized than others. While many big zoos house and keep all sorts of critters, the Lubee Bat Conservancy in Gainesville, Florida is one of those specializing in a specific species - bats. This conservatory researches many different kinds of bats, while also focusing on educating the public about these nocturnal creatures. At the Lubee Bat Conservancy, guests can see many different types of bats, and can witness them in their natural habitats. With enclosures and habitats that are set up to be both bat friendly and user friendly, guests can feel that they are walking among the bats, and can enjoy learning as much about them through interactive exhibits. The Lubee Bat Conservancy is an international and non profit organization. They are dedicated to protecting the diversity that comes with the bat - and what they can do to keep these species safe in the wild. Most of the bats found in the conservancy are fruit and nectar bats. This is due to these species' specific vulnerability to extinction. Fruit and nectar bats are vital to the way that the rainforest and deserts provide countries with food and sustenance, as the bats actually help these crops grow through fertilization and eating harmful bugs that could damage the plants. The conservancy works with more than 145 types of plants that are dependent on the fruit bats. Something to remember about the Lubee Bat Conservancy is that it is a conservation research facility, and therefore they are not open to the public all of the time. This means that if guests want to visit the bat conservancy, they need to have an appointment, unlike at other zoos, where people can visit at any time during operating hours. Guests can tour the facility from 1 to 4, Tuesday through Saturday with a prior appointment. Guests will want to contact the Conservancy about 4 weeks before they want to visit, and probably will need to be flexible about the dates or times that they would like to be there. The advantage to this appointment system, however, is that visitors will get specialized tours instead of just walking through the facility by themselves. The tour that one will take is about 1 hour long. Included is a 20 minute presentation, called Bats are Superheroes, which gives guests a short look at the life of a bat and the work being done at the conservatory. On the tour, guests will learn about bats, their biology, and the role that bats play in the environment. Then there will be a 30-minute visit to the bat center to meet the bats. There is no cost to tour this location, but remember that this is a non-profit facility, so guests should consider making a small donation. This will help keep the facility running throughout the year, and will provide staffing so that they can continue not only researching bats, but also giving tours to the public."

"Mel Fisher's Treasure Museum","Florida","Mel Fisher's Treasure Museum","Mel Fisher's Treasure Museum is located in Sebastian, Florida. Mel Fisher was a real man. He was known as a legend in Florida and was considered the World's Greatest Treasure Hunter. His goal was to find a real-life treasure, just as most people dream of one day doing. The difference between him and everyone else who has ever dreamed of finding a fortune is that Fisher did find his. To this day, others are inspired to continue treasure hunting in the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Ocean, looking for treasures that lie beneath the sea. Fisher's treasures were part of the sinking of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha and the Santa Margarita. These boats were Spanish galleons, sunk in a hurricane in 1622, just off the coast of Key West. When Fisher discovered his treasure, not everyone supported him. He fought court battles, all the way up to the level of the United States Supreme Court, in an effort to retain ownership of his $450 million treasure find. There were more than 40 tons of silver and gold making up the collection, as well as 1000 silver bars, gold coins and Columbian emeralds. Today, there are still pieces of the treasure on the sea floor and Mel Fisher guides divers to finding them during dives. "

More than just event planning, the BID also works with the city to design parking areas and garner funds for improvements, such as resuming the historic trolley service. Shut down when automobiles became popular, the trolley was reintroduced as a resolution to the area's parking congestion.

"Myakka Canopy Walkway","Florida","Myakka Canopy Walkway","The Myakka Canopy Walkway is located in Sarasota, Florida. It is located just off the Boylston Nature Trail, on one of the spurs connected to the main trail. The entire trail is less than an hour to walk, even when moving slowly. Those wanting to just visit the walkway have about a five minute walk on the spur. The walkway was the work of canopy scientist Dr. Margaret Lowman. She spent time researching tree tops, but struggle to find the perfect way to get over the trees in order to conduct the best research. She worked on several continents before coming to the Selby Botanical Gardens in Sarasota. There, she worked as director of the gardens. During her time in the position, she recognized many of the same challenges facing Florida's forests that she saw in tropical climates around the world. She also understood the domestic forests were in just as much trouble. This inspired her to use the same overhead methods to study Florida trees as she did elsewhere. She began her studies in Florida with the Myakka treetops by lifting herself above the trees with ladders, ropes and pulleys. This allowed her to build a walkway through the trees. Today, it is this walkway that is open to the public. "
"Myakka City Lemur Reserve","Florida","Myakka City Lemur Reserve - Myakka City, Florida - lemur preservation and research center","Located on a 90-acre plot in eastern Manatee County, the Myakka City Lemur Reserve is home to nearly 40 lemurs in a colony that is used for both breeding and research. This is one of the few lemur reserves in the country, so it is a great resource for studying these fascinating animals. The facility has everything lemurs need to lead a happy and healthy life, and guests are welcome for a tour to see these amazing primates from Madagascar. The Myakka City Lemur Reserve works closely within national Species Survival Plan guidelines to keep the lemurs safe and encourage breeding. Lemurs are originally only from the island of Madagascar, and they face extinction if not supported by researchers, since they have a fairly small natural habitat. The reserve is supported by the Duke University Lemur Center, the Lemur Conservation Foundation Advisory Council, the Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group, and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The lemurs at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve live in two 13-acre enclosures, found in the forest of the reserve. Their patches of land are surrounded by chain link fences, which are electrified on a very low voltage to prevent the animals from escaping. Along with the natural landscape of Florida, zookeepers have planted mango, passion fruit, guava, bamboo, and other species of plants that are naturally found in a lemur's habitat and also grow well in Florida. The first enclosure is called the Reed and Barbara Toomey Lemur Pavilion, and it has a cinder block building and other indoor enclosures within the area to shelter the animals during extreme weather situations. The second enclosure is called Jim Toomey Woods. Within this area, there's a separate shelter called the Marilyn K. North Lemur Lodge, which has rooms for the animals, as well as a veterinary space. Before joining the other lemurs in Jim Toomey Woods or the Reed and Barbara Toomey Lemur Pavilion, lemurs must spend a month in the reserve's quarantine shelter. This ensures that the animal is healthy and won't make any of the other lemurs sick. The primary goal of the Myakka City Lemur Reserve is to research the animals that live there, unlike many zoos, which focus on attracting tourists. So, around the enclosures, there are a number of buildings to house the people who work at the reserve. The Fisher Caretaker's Cottage is the house for the main full-time caretaker at the reserve, and along with a living space, there's also a large attached greenhouse to grow food for the lemurs. There's also The Researchers' House, which has four bedrooms to accommodate researchers who are visiting the reserve. Nearby, guests will find the Tranasoa Myakka, also called the Myakka Welcome House. This house at the edge of the reserve serves as a home for staff who spend the night at the reserve, and can accommodate researchers and professors who are making short visits to the area. There's also an area that was set aside in 2004 called Red Dog Woods that will later become an additional enclosure for the animals, and other buildings on the reserve serve as research labs and libraries. Because this is a research facility and not a zoo, interested parties should call ahead to schedule a visit. Depending on the plans of the reserve for the day, they may or may not be able to accommodate requests."

Originally a cattle ranch, the site was developed by the members of Franklin Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) with help from the National Park Service, and was officially opened as a state park in 1942. Much of the park still looks as it did in that year and many of the buildings built by the CCC still stand. This immense park stretches 58 square miles and includes a variety of eco-systems including wetlands, prairies, hammocks, and pinelands. The major focus of the park is the mighty Myakka River, dubbed one of Florida's wild and scenic'' rivers. On the waters of the Myakka, as well as on Upper Myakka Lake, guests can enjoy a variety of active pursuits, including boating, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. Boat ramps provide easy access and the Myakka River Outpost rents kayaks and canoes. Visitors can also tour the lake on the two largest airboats in the world - The Myakka Maiden or the Gator Gal. These airboats, which hold several dozen passengers per trip, can venture easily into shallow waters and allow guests a close-up look at the unique flora and fauna of the park, including some resident alligators. For those who prefer to stay on land, the Tram Safari takes visitors into the backwoods of Myakka River State Park, where they'll discover what southwest Florida looked like long before it was settled. Nearly 39 miles of hiking trails wind throughout the park and backcountry roads travel straight into its interior. Day hikers can choose portions of trails while backpackers may want to tackle the entire loop. Permits are required for backpacking and camping. Six primitive campgrounds are located along the trail, each with three campsites. In addition, biking can be enjoyed on 7 miles of paved roads that encircle the park and a three-loop horse trail covers about 12 miles of back country. Myakka River State Park's Canopy Walkway is a hit with all ages. Reached via a spur trail off the Boylston Nature Trail, the Canopy Walkway was the brainchild of Dr. Margaret Lowman, who was interested in studying the endangered eco-systems of Florida, including its forests. The suspension bridge-type walkway is 25 feet high and 85 feet tall. Visitors may get an extra good look at the treetops by climbing the walkway's 74 foot-high tower. It cost nearly $100,000 to build the Canopy Walkway and it is the most-visited attraction in the park. Four picnic pavilions are available to visitors who may bring their own food or purchase snacks or lunch from the onsite concession, which sells gator stew and gator sandwiches. In addition to primitive campgrounds, full-facility camping is also available and includes restroom facilities with hot showers."

"Naples Pier a Longtime Community Landmark","Florida","Naples Pier a Longtime Community Landmark","	The Naples Pier, situated at the west end of 12th Avenue South off Gulf Shore Boulevard in Naples, Florida, was originally built in 1888 as a freight and passenger dock. In its early days, the pier was lined with narrow gauge train rails that spanned the entire length of the structure, designed to transport baggage and freight to waiting vessels that would travel across the Atlantic or to other points in the Caribbean or along the Eastern seaboard. The Naples Municipal Pier has been rebuilt a number of times during its lifetime. It was first destroyed by a hurricane in 1910 and then again in 1926 and 1960. In 1922, a fire consumed much of the pier and the post office that sat upon it. Throughout the last 50 years, however, it has remained steadfast, only experiencing minor damage from the violent summer storms that sometimes touch the southwest Florida coast. Today, the Naples City Pier no longer serves as a dock for boat traffic but is instead the most popular place in Naples for fishing. From sunrise to sunset, avid anglers line the pier with their rods and buckets of bait, hoping to score a good catch for the day. Unlike elsewhere in Naples, fishing from the pier does not require a state fishing license as the city of Naples purchased a bulk license that covers anyone who casts their line off the pier. For many, the Naples Municipal Pier, which stretches 1,000 feet out into the Gulf of Mexico, is the ideal place to enjoy the southwest Florida sunset. Visitors gather in droves on the pier at dusk in order to experience the beautiful colors of nature. It is also a great place for a long, relaxing stroll and the benches along the pier accommodate those who want to sit a while and enjoy watching the gentle lapping of the small waves in the Gulf of Mexico. A concession stand sits at about the halfway point on the pier and caters to fishermen and others who spend time relaxing atop this man-made structure. Pelicans and other birds frequent the pier, looking for scraps left over by the anglers and hoping others will toss them a treat or two. The beach around the pier is lively and is lined with some of Naples' most luxurious homes, many visible from atop the pier. There is nearly always some sort of group activity occurring in the vicinity of the municipal pier as well, including energetic beach volleyball games that draw a crowd of spectators. Parking is available at a lot located one block east of the pier and on-street parking is available to pier visitors as well, though most of it is metered."
"Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens is a Delightful Animal Habitat","Florida","Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens is a Delightful Animal Habitat","	The Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens, an accredited zoo, had its beginnings as a tropical plant sanctuary in 1919. The garden was founded by Dr. Henry Nehrling, a botanist, who established it in order to preserve the tropical plants he noticed where quickly disappearing from southwest Florida. Nehrling, a leading naturalist of the time, encouraged others like him to visit his Naples-area garden and together they continued the quest to preserve the flora and fauna of the region. Nehrling died in 1929, and it would be nearly 40 years before his plant sanctuary was turned into something more than just a garden. First, in the 1950s, Julius Fleischmann, of the Fleischmann Yeast empire, took it upon himself to restore Nehrling's gardens, which had been neglected after his death. The entrepreneur added an array of tropical birds to the newly-renovated gardens and gave it a new name - Caribbean Gardens. In 1967, television personalities and animal aficionados, Lawrence and Nancy Jane Tetzlaff, aka Jungle Larry and Safari Jane, arrived at the Caribbean Gardens with their unique collection of rare animals, who quickly made their home there. More animals were added, and by 1969, Naples Zoo was a full-fledged zoological garden. Today's 52-acre Naples Zoo features hundreds of animals representing dozens of species, all nestled in a pristine tropical setting amidst habitats not unlike their natural homes. Exhibits along the zoo's 1-mile natural walkway include Tiger Forest, Leopard Rock, Backyard Habitat, Petrof's Primate Pavilion, Africa's Lions, African Wild Dogs, Panther Glade, Alligator Bay, and African Oasis. Aside from enjoying self-guided tours of the zoo's many exhibits, zoo staff also offer several shows a day to entertain guests. Many of the shows give zoo visitors the opportunity to have a closer look at the animals while others focus on the jobs of zoo staff and what it takes to be an animal handler or other zoo professional. Visitors may also take a botanical tour of the Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens. As this site existed for 50 years as a garden, it still boasts a rich botanical history and many of the plants and trees inside the zoo are quite old and historic. This guided tour, led by a master gardener, gives guests a closer look at the zoo's garden. These tropical plant treks are usually offered once each week and are included at no additional fee. Zoo staff members also lead a Primate Expedition Cruise, an enjoyable and informative boat ride past islands full of playful primates, including Siamang apes, spider monkeys, Madagascar lemurs, and several other species. The 20-30 minute tour aboard a catamaran is included with admission and can be enjoyed numerous times during a visit, if desired, and the cruise offers exceptional photo opportunities for amateur and professional photographers."

Today, there are many products on the market in the United States that are labeled as fair trade. While this might help the consumer feel good about his purchase, Nontando believes it actually makes life more difficult for the artist in the country of origin. Laborers who create fair trade products are often treated as slave labor. Nontando instead uses items that are labeled free trade.

"North Dry Rocks","Florida","North Dry Rocks","Experiencing the reef system of Key Largo, Florida is an experience any diver or snorkeler should not miss due to the brilliant colors, plethora of fish, shrimp, lobster, sting rays, and plant life that makes up Key Largo Reefs. North Dry Rocks is considered part of French Reef and is well known for its Minnow Cave. There is a seasonal population of glass minnows that frequent the reef surrounding divers and snorkelers. Grouper, Snapper, and the occasional shark are also found in the area.  The actual cave is a small L shaped tube of coral that gets filled with minnows, which swim in and out of the tube of coral. Visibility on a dive can be 50 feet plus for divers and snorkelers, especially on a perfect sunny day. Depth is 25 to 35 feet, which makes it a great spot for underwater naturalists, peak performance buoyancy, or underwater photography courses for divers. North Dry Rocks like many other Key Largo dives is a boat dive requiring at least 45 minutes to reach the site. In April this dive can be 76 degrees F, while in summer water temperatures may reach over 80 degrees F, thus a skin suit is perfect for staying warm."

"Oakbrook Labyrinth","Florida","Oakbrook Labyrinth","The Oakbrook Labyrinth is located in Ocala, Florida at the Oakbrook Life Enrichment Center on NorthEast 28th Avenue. The labyrinth is located south of the center of the facility, next to the Wedding Garden. The labyrinth is similar to a maze, designed to be walked in reflection, contemplation and meditation. This is a tradition from the East, often overlooked or rushed over in the Western style of living. Eastern teachings are becoming more popular in the modern Western world and the labyrinth offers visitors to the center a chance to take time being calm and at peace. Seated meditation requires extreme concentration and many people are intimidated by this. A labyrinth is able to provide the same quiet of mind, but since the body is moving, it requires less active concentration. The tension is gone and there is a mind-body connection that allows the mind to meander and form images and thoughts, eventually releasing them and healing the spirit. Suggested tips for walking the Oakbrook Labyrinth include pausing at the start, growing centered and quiet before entering the labyrinth. Follow the path. There are no dead-ends and it is not officially a maze. The process is as important as the end. When finished, be attentive and give thanks for your experience. The labyrinth welcomes visitors at any time. "

"Ocean Drive is a Blend of all Miami Beach has to Offer","Florida","Ocean Drive is a Blend of all Miami Beach has to Offer","	The town's busiest street and one of its most popular tourist areas, Ocean Drive is the center of all that is Miami Beach.	Full of Art Deco buildings, upscale shops, international eateries, and lots of beautiful people from all over the world, this main drag through town is quintessential Miami Beach. In the 60s, 70s, and much of the 80s, Ocean Drive, which is just a block from the Atlantic, was typical of many other parts of Miami and Miami Beach. The area had become rundown and most residents and visitors would not frequent the neighborhood, especially after dark. Crime was rampant and drugs were readily sold on street corners. However, several visionary entrepreneurs were able to reinvigorate the area. Beginning with the opening of the News Caf, in 1988, Ocean Drive gradually saw boarded up stores and restaurants become profitable places of business and tourists began returning to the area. Soon, the area's Art Deco hotels were being painted, neon signs were being repaired, and people were recognizing Ocean Drive as a prime tourist area. When Gloria Estefan stepped in and joined in the regentrification efforts, others jumped on the bandwagon and by the mid-1990s, Ocean Drive - and the rest of South Beach - became a much sought-after destination for international travelers. It also became Miami Beach's headquarters for the modeling industry. It's not unusual to view several photo shoots along Ocean Drive during the course of just one day, and many well-known modeling agencies have obtained offices along this costly expanse of real estate. Ocean Drive, however, is more than just a place for people watching, though it is an excellent place to view South Beach's trim and fit population. The boulevard is an important part of Miami Beach's Art Deco Historic District, lined with kitschy hotels with bold neon lights and typical art deco ornamentation like oversized palm trees and cruise ship motif. Many are painted in sparkling pastels like peach and sea green. Some are designed for budget travelers while others are among the most expensive in Miami Beach. Office buildings and other commercial properties also boast Art Deco touches, and the local Miami Design Preservation League, with offices on Ocean Drive, eagerly offer guided tours of the area's best examples of Art Deco architecture which - in Miami Beach - is known as Streamline Moderne. Tours are affordable and offer great insight into the town's unique architectural gems. The rest of Ocean Drive consists of mainly stores and restaurants. This north-south thoroughfare, which runs from 1st to 15th Street, is lined with boutique shops offering mostly pricey wares and is also home to some of the city's finest restaurants. Clubbing is a big part of the Ocean Drive scene as well and the area is especially crowded during Spring Break week, when the clubs cater specifically to college students who party until the wee hours of the morning."

Anchored by Dillard's, Macy's, and Sears, the Oviedo Marketplace is promoted as the `town center' for the metro area's newer upscale communities. At the junction of 417, Central Florida's Greenway and Red Bug Lake Road, the Oviedo Marketplace is easy to find. The physical address is, 1700 Oviedo Marketplace Boulevard, Oviedo Florida. Open Monday through Saturday from 10:00am to 9:00pm and Sunday from 12:00pm to 6:00pm, the Marketplace has holiday hours from 10:00am to 6:00pm. The mall opened in 1998 and was refurbished and expanded in 2000. There is space in the mall for ninety retail stores. Besides the mall anchors you'll find Gymboree, Jos. A. Bank, Journeys, Payless Shoe Source, a Regal Cinema with twenty-two screens, Bed Bath & Beyond, and a Chamberlain Market and Caf,. There is also a Hot Topic, PacSun and Barnes and Noble complete with Starbucks caf,. The Oviedo Marketplace has several choices for nail and hair salons as well as bridal and tuxedo stores. Primarily the Marketplace caters to those living in the Northeast Orlando, Oviedo/Winter Springs suburban area. The orlando.retailguide.com commented that this was a quiet mall with good stores, security, handicap access and frequent live entertainment. The mall has stroller rental available and on holidays there are regular specials. A comment from yelp.com in June 20, 2009 reiterated that the mall was quiet and the movie theater clean and un-crowded. The reviewer warned that this was not the place to expect thrills. Food choices are plentiful. Starting with Auntie Anne's, RJ Gator's Florida Sea Grill and Bar, and progressing to food court front-runners such as Chick-fil-A and Subway. You'll also find other options like Kelly's Cajun Grill, Mediterranean Gourmet, Sarku Japan and Smoothy Bee and Auntie Ann's pretzels. The Oviedo Marketplace is owned by General Growth Properties. Based in Chicago, Illinois, this developer also owns the nearby Altamonte Mall. The same General Manager manages both malls. Over the last few years there have been several Orlando Sentinel articles addressing how many indoor shopping malls are struggling to survive when the existing economic trend seems to favor outdoor malls. Oviedo Marketplace is feeling this pain. A specific article in the Orlando Sentinel in February 2009 highlighted the Marketplace's recent loss of American Eagle Outfitters and the candy store Bourbon Street Candy. The mall is working to stay viable, providing a positive experience in an un-crowded, air-conditioned environment. But my advice would be to verify which stores are available before you visit this quiet mall."
"Pa-hay-okee Trail","Florida","Pa-hay-okee Trail","The Pa-hay-okee Trail is located within the Everglades National Park near Homestead in Florida and is approximately 75 miles from Miami. The trailhead is approximately 13 miles from the main park entrance at the Ernest Coe Visitor Center. The Visitor Center is open all year round from 9am to 5pm and is a good place to obtain maps and information about the trails in this part of the park.  This is a short 400 meter round trip that leads to an observation platform overlooking the sweeping vistas of sawgrass. Cycling is not permitted along this boardwalk trail but it is wheelchair accessible. The viewing platform will allow visitors to observe several species of bird such as red-shouldered hawks, red-winged blackbirds and vultures. The tiny sharp teeth of the sawgrass are not the ideal habitat for wildlife but looking down from the observation platform it may be possible to sight an alligator. Before or after taking the trail, hikers may want to stop at the visitor center where there is often a special exhibition of work by local artists. Souvenirs can be purchased here too such as books, postcards and insect repellant, which is advisable for hikers to take with them in the park during the summer."
"Palatka Mall","Florida","Palatka Mall - Palatka, Florida - Indoor Shopping Mall","Anchored by Goodys and JC Penny, Palatka Mall is the only enclosed mall in this Florida region. Besides the department store anchors, this mall houses national tenants Cato, Hibbett's Sports, Merle Norman and Friedman's Jewelers. The 196,000 square foot mall is also home to the offices of the Florida Department of Health, Education and Revenue and the United States Armed Forces Recruiting. The Palatka Mall is located on the fast growing Highway 19 corridor. The physical address is 400 North SR 19, Palatka, Florida. Mall hours are listed as open from 8:00am to 9:00pm. Call specific stores and verify. Information gleaned from online mall review sites and news articles suggest that the mall has a Dollar General, two jewelry stores, a movie cinema, and a few clothing stores besides the anchor stores of Goody's and a JC Penny's. One reviewer added that the biggest part of the mall is government offices including Tax Collector, Unemployment Office, Military Recruiters and a few others. Appropriately called the Palatka Mall Theatre, the gainsvillemoms.com Website showed four movies listed at this mall and the times for these movies. Like the mall, the movie theatre doesn't have its own Website. Waymarking.com, a scavenger hunt website that requires people to go out and visit sites before they report on them, has a possible explanation for why this mall diversified to include a large selection of government offices. It states that the Palatka Mall was intended to be the center of westward expansion for Putnam County. Since the mall was developed on the outskirts of town, the community moved west and away from the downtown business area. After awhile the mall couldn't attract regular clients for its stores and so become a quasi-government service center. This explanation makes sense, especially when coupled with the Orlando Sentinel articles in 2008 and 2009 written about the state of indoor malls in the Orlando area specifically and in Florida in more general terms. The focus of these articles has been on indoor shopping centers loosing tenants and struggling financially because the economic curve seems to favor outdoor malls. Certainly my research indicates that the indoor malls that not only survive, but thrive - do so by providing extraordinary services and aesthetics. Outdoor malls appear on the surface to be having an easier time of it. Adding insult to injury is the fact that new development surrounds Palatka Mall, including Lowe's, Home Depot, and a Wal-Mart Supercenter. An online reviewer commented on the Palatka Mall interior noting that it had been renovated several times over the last few years in an attempt to reflect a new, progressive nature. It currently has a central courtyard with a water fountain and planters as its centerpiece. In all the reviews I read about Palatka Mall, the only mention of food being available was Twistee Treat."

"Palm Beach Mall","Florida","Palm Beach Mall - West Palm Beach, Florida - Indoor Shopping Mall","The story of the Palm Beach Mall isn't over, but it's at a point where it could go either way - a pile of rubble, or a Phoenix rising from the ashes. Typical of what is happening to enclosed shopping malls in Florida, its life is on the line and it will take time to see if it survives and in what capacity. The last half of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009 was a bad time for the Palm Beach Mall. Dillard's abruptly closed on October 31, 2008. Macy's closed January 8, 2009 and on March 9, the mall reduced their hours. On April 14, 2009 JPMorgan Chase filed a foreclosure suit against the owners of the Palm Beach Mall for failure to repay a loan that had been used for the shopping center. The proposed foreclosure wants the mall sold to cover the mortgage. Then it got worse. A June 7, 2009 article in the Palm Beach Post states: Good news for tenants and customers of the Palm Beach Mall. A Palm Beach County Circuit Court judge has appointed a caretaker to temporarily oversee the 41-year-old West Palm Beach shopping center.'' This might seem unimportant, except that the power company was set to turn the power off because the bill hadn't been paid. Having a caretaker is supposed to keep this from happening again. Located in West Palm Beach, Florida, this mall was the first enclosed shopping mall in Palm Beach County. There is a history of support from the community to try and keep this mall viable in some form. In June of 2009 it looked like a loosing battle. Left with only a few stores open, JC Penny's and Sears are still there. One mall reviewer said that the rest of the area is filled with unrecognizable merchants and empty storefronts. Why is the mall struggling? There are several factors. Local newspapers site competition from other malls as one reason, with the current economic trend favoring outdoor shopping centers. The papers also point to high crime rates in and around the mall, pushing the facility into decline. Simon Property Group, Inc owns Palm Beach Mall. This S&P 500 Company is the largest public U.S. real estate company. They currently own or have an interest in three hundred and eighty six properties in North America, Europe and Asia. Simon Property Group, Inc. is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana and employs more than five thousand people worldwide. One of the executives for Simon hinted to the community that there is a workable plan that would include more than a million square feet of general retail space, a 290,000-square-foot furniture store, 300,000 square feet of offices and 500 residential units.'' The Simon spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the plans or discuss possible tenants, but community leaders say the furniture store is Ikea. If the mall is developed into a mixed-use development, area residents feel there is hope. West Palm Beach Mayor Lois Frankel said Simon would likely turn the mall into an outdoor plaza but keep anchors JCPenney and Sears. He also suggested that the work would be done in phases so the mall could stay open during construction. Cynthia Cohen, head of a national retail-consulting firm in Miami, said Ikea would be a real game-changer for the center. Other analysts agree. If you plan to visit Palm Beach Mall in the near future, call ahead, talk to locals, and find out what is open and the state of the mall."

Lights are needed for the dive, especially if you are planning to explore the cavern during your experience. Divers can go down 60 or 90 feet for amazing views, especially if they look upwards and see how far they have sunk. One diver even dove down to 92 feet and was intimidated by how dark and frightening the area had become. There are several fossils in the upper caverns and both upper and lower areas are just as fun to explore. This means both experienced and novice scuba divers can enjoy the dive. What divers like most about this area, besides the large caverns and generally scenic dive, is the fact that it is so unknown.

"Peanut Island a Great Recreation Destination","Florida","Peanut Island a Great Recreation Destination","	Located in the Intercoastal Waterway near the Lake Worth Inlet and the Port of Palm Beach, Peanut Island is a recreational area owned by Palm Beach County. Since 1923, it served as a spoil site for the maintenance of the inlet and the Port shipping channel, but a portion of the 80 acre island was made available to the public in the 1990s under a long term arrangement between the county and the local Port Authority. The island got its unusual name when the State of Florida gave permission for the island to be used as a shipping terminal for peanut oil. The endeavor never materialized and the idea was eventually dropped, but the name stuck. Today, the county offers parts of the island to locals and visitors who enjoy various recreational pursuits there. Open from sunrise to sunset, Peanut Island consists of both guarded and unguarded swimming areas as well as a snorkeling lagoon. The beaches are clean and many of the guarded areas are suitable for families with young children. Snorkelers must bring their own equipment. Peanut Island is also a hit with boaters. Boat docks and slips are located on both the east and west sides of the island. The 14 slips on the east side are for day use on a first come, first served basis. The same rules apply to the floating docks on the west side of Peanut Island. Shaded picnic areas can be found around most of the island. Pavilions, tables, and grills are available on a first come basis as well. Chiki Huts'' with picnic tables are available near the snorkeling lagoon and are tropical in style. For those who wish to walk or jog, a 1.25 mile paved walking path winds around the perimeter of the island and provides a good way to explore the island or enjoy the water views that surround it. The path takes guests through several ecosystems, including mangrove forest, tidal ponds, and maritime hammocks, and is lighted at night for the safety of walkers.

Because it is located on a low-lying barrier island, Pensacola Beach has historically been very vulnerable to hurricanes. Storm surges are prone to covering large portions of the island and record of severe damage from hurricanes dates back to the 1700s. Most recently, in 2004, Hurricane Ivan destroyed more than 650 homes and several other man-made structures on the island. Nevertheless, Pensacola Beach is a popular vacation destination. Boasting a temperate climate year round, this portion of the Florida panhandle attracts snow birds from the North and Midwest who come to escape the cold winters.

"Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse and Museum a Florida Landmark","Florida","Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse and Museum a Florida Landmark","	Originally known as the Light Station at Mosquito Inlet'', the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse is the tallest in Florida and the second tallest lighthouse in the U.S., soaring to 175 feet. Completed in 1887, this lighthouse became a designated National Historic Landmark in 1998. About 100,000 people visit the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse and Museum each year. Located 12 miles south of Daytona Beach, this historic monument is maintained by the non-profit Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse Preservation Association, which has restored the light station to its current state as one of the best preserved, most complete lighthouses in the U.S. Throughout its lifetime as an operating aid-to-navigation, the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse was serviced by many keepers who lived on the premises with their families. Keepers and assistant keepers were assigned to the lighthouse until 1953, at which time it became fully automated. In 1970, the U.S. Coast Guard, who had assumed care of the lighthouse in 1939, abandoned it in favor of a new light on the other side of Ponce Inlet. The original structure was allowed to fall into disrepair and much of it was destroyed by vandals. In 1972, it was deeded to the Town of Ponce Inlet, which proceeded to form the Lighthouse Preservation Association and gradually restore the lighthouse to its original state. Visitors to this beautifully-maintained piece of Florida history may climb the tower on their own and may also visit the keeper's quarters and other historic buildings on the property, which now make up the Ponce de Leon Inlet Lighthouse Museum. Guests may begin their tour at the former woodshed, now a video theater that airs a 20-minute film on the history of the structure and those who served it. The Boatyard area displays historic vessels from various eras and inside the former Oil Storage House, guests will find exhibits of small aids-to-navigation. The Second Assistant Keeper's Dwelling is now the main museum, displaying photographs, artifacts, charts, old uniforms, and many other items pertinent to the history of the lighthouse and town of Ponce Inlet.

Scheduled several times each year, these tours are led by re-enactors dressed as former lighthouse keepers.

The anchor stores for this mall are JC Penny's and Belks. In June 2009 there are twenty-three specialty shops and a Blockbuster video store. There are plans to significantly increase the number of stores within a year. You can find Ponce de Leon Mall at 2121 US Highway 1 S in St Augustine, Florida. U.S. Highway 1 is the region's major north-south thoroughfare. Ponce de Leon Mall is located less than 2 miles away from the beach. This mall is open Monday through Saturday from 10:00am to 9:00pm and on Sunday from 12:00pm to 5:00pm. Ponce de Leon mall is the only enclosed regional mall located within a forty-mile radius. This climate controlled environment houses a GNC store, Flower's by Shirley and The Scrub Hut. There is also a dance boutique, an auction house and a community theatre. At the time this article was written the sole restaurant option is De Leon Pizza. This mall has suffered in the last few years as the popularity of indoor malls decreased while outdoor malls increased. Because of this current market trend, the mall's owner wanted to tear it down. Hull Storey Gibson Company, a retail real estate management and development company based in Augusta, Georgia, owns Ponce de Leon Mall. Hull Storey Gibson's charter is to acquire enclosed malls and shopping center properties and develop them into what is known as a big box retail facility. This means they tear properties down and put big box buildings in place of the mall. Buildings that hold something like Lowe's or Pet Sense. In a May 2009 article in the St. Augustine Record, the Company CEO John Gibson admitted that Hull Storey Gibson wanted to demolish the mall. He goes on to say, We discouraged tenants from staying, leasing month-to-month with the goal of redevelopment. But Belk's and Penney's are doing - and have done - so well that we've refocused our efforts on making the mall a success.'' Part of the new commitment to success included a new roof in 2008. Other additions consist of carpeting, raised ceilings and new lighting. The renovations extend to fresh black mulch and white columns flanking the front entrance. Future renovations include tearing down the recently vacated Regal Cinema. It will be raw land, Gibson said. That will provide a better view of Belk's. No one is coming back to build a theater here again. He had a more positive message for prospective tenants. We want to work with you, he said. If you are committed, if you want a better location, another location - call us. The St. Augustine paper reports that mall tenants are hopeful. Frank Arguello, who has owned De Leon Pizza at the Ponce mall for nearly 20 years, is opening a new pizza shop at the EPIC Theatres complex on State Road 207. But he said because of recent discussions with mall owners, he might remain at his current location as well. They told me everything I wanted to hear, Arguello said."

Guests can choose to ride Big Thunder, which resembles a funnel lying on its side and confronts runners with a long, dark tunnel, forty-five degree drops and a rapid plunge that leaves riders weightless. Or they can opt to ride Black Thunder, where four riders in a large tube travel through pitch black darkness into a funnel and, eventually, drop into a pool below. Other slides include the Body Blasters body slide, featuring 1,000 feet of darkness, and the Pirate Plunge, another body slide, this one also with a dark tunnel and a 70-foot drop. Raging Rapids is a family-oriented tube ride that's appropriate for all ages to enjoy together.

Also good for families is Riptide Raftin', which features 500 feet of twists and turns and a chance to get soaked by three waterfalls. Superbowls is a tube-less bowl ride that takes guests on a high-speed ride that ends in a misty bowl, where they go round and round until being flushed into the pool below.

"Raymond James Stadium","Florida","Raymond James Stadium - Tampa, Florida - Home of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers","Located in Tampa Bay, Florida, Raymond James Stadium is home to the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers. It is also home to the South Florida Bulls of the University of South Florida, and hosts the New Year's Day Outback Bowl and has held several Super Bowls. After football season ends in January/February, the venue is host to the Monster Jam monster truck rally, and has been home to several Major League Soccer games, the last of which was held in 2001. Also known as the Ray Jay'', Raymond James Stadium has been home to the Buccaneers since 1998. The venue is managed by the Tampa Sports Authority, and the naming rights were purchased by Raymond James Financial, Inc. of St. Petersburg, Florida. The deal was signed for 13 years, and cost $32.5 million. However, it was extended, with the name of the venue staying in place until at least 2015. Construction for Raymond James Stadium took place in fall of 1996, with its completion in September 1998. The first game was between the Buccaneers and the Chicago Bears on September 20, 1998. All in all, the construction cost $168.5 million. The stadium was built to replace Houlihan's Stadium, which is located right next to the Ray. The venue has a capacity of 65,857, but is capable of holding up to 75,000 for special events. Raymond James Stadium is well-equipped for all sorts of events. Event sizes can range anywhere from 50 to 50,000 patrons, and can be held anywhere from the east and west restaurants to the field itself. Other options include club lounges and the press box. For patrons with disabilities, Raymond James Stadium offers close parking and easily accessible entrances. Elevators are also available to make every patron's visit a good one. Raymond James Stadium is also adorned with a pair of Buc Vision'' video screens that are 92' wide, making them some of the largest in the league. The venue also boasts rotating billboards, replacing the stationary ones in 2003. The open-roofed venue has a natural grass surface (Tifway 419 Bermuda), and has been rated the best turf in the NFL'' in the 2004 biannual player's survey. In 2006, the Raymond James Stadium had its stadium seats replaced due to the original seats turning a pink color as opposed to the red color they were supposed to be. This issue was due to a lack of a UV protective chemical being mixed in with the seats during the molding process. The replacement of these seats was the result of a $1.5 million agreement. Perhaps the most unique feature of Raymond James Stadium is the 103 foot long, 43 ton pirate ship made of concrete and steel. During games, it celebrates any points scored by the Buccaneers by firing rubber footballs and confetti into the crowd. It also boasts an automate parrot that squawks and talks to fans. During the more important games of the season, the event is covered from the pirate ship itself, expressing much of the venue's distinct character."

"Redfish Pass","Florida","Redfish Pass","Redfish Pass is a haven for fishermen and surfers alike. It was formed in 1921 when the Hurricane of 1921 caused Sanibel Island to separate itself from the larger Captiva Island. It connects Pine Island Sound to the Gulf of Mexico., and its name is taken from the enormous amounts of red fish which were caught in the pass soon after it formed. There are still mammoth portions of redfish, snook, and many other species of game fish which can be caught in Redfish Pass.   While many believe the Hurricane of 1921 caused the pass to form, one local legend is it was originally dug by island natives who did not want to paddle their boat all the way around the northern end of Captiva Island to get to the Gulf. This could explain why the depth suddenly drops from four feet in the flats to a thirty three foot hole in the center. The hurricane may have just finished the job. Redfish Pass is a popular destination for fishermen and surfers. The waters can be calm one minute and have rolling waves perfect for surfing the next. Locals have tried to limit the number of visitors to their island by only allowing one road to extend to it, making a boat the best way to get there."

The monument is meant to be a reminder of the years France and Spain fought for control of Florida. The column found on the site is a reproduction of the actual monument, which was placed at the mouth of St. Johns River. It was created due to Ribault hence the name of the monument.  Ribault was sent to Florida in 1562 from France on a mission by Admiral Gaspard de Coligny. Ribault was supposed to lay claim to any part of North America that he could, given the fact that the Spanish were already claiming all of North America as theirs. The monument is on one of the highest points in the city. The original was placed there in 1562 to lay claim to the land Ribault landed on. A sketch in 1564 of it has helped the restored monument compare to the original. The monument is free to see and located near Fort Caroline. The Fort was built a few years after the actual monument.

Those who grew up attending circus performances in their town will love to see the history of the circus company and learn about the families involved in the events. The circus museum was the idea of A. Everett Austin, who was the Ringling Museum's first director. The goal was to keep alive the memory of the founder of Sarasota, as well as commemorate the circus events. The Ringling Museum of the American Circus was created in 1948. It was the first of its kind, documenting circus history. Since there were a lot of circus folk living in Sarasota, the collection of memorabilia grew very quickly. The collection includes circus papers, wardrobe, performance props, business records and a variety of equipment and photographs. Many believe the history of the circus parallels the history of the United States. The mission of the museum is to  present the history of the American circus to our visitors and to make circus artifacts accessible to a diverse audience. Over the years the country has changed and so has the circus, but even today, there are annual performances in cities across the country that still bring circus fans, young and old, to the big top. "
"Ringling Circus Museum a Sarasota Treasure","Florida","Ringling Circus Museum a Sarasota Treasure","	Just one part of the extensive Ringling complex that sits on Sarasota Bay in Sarasota, Florida, the Ringling Circus Museum is a treat for young and old. Situated on the grounds of what was once the winter home of the famed Ringling Bros. Circus, the museum touts the history of the circus and gives guest a chance to view rare artifacts and other items associated with The Greatest Show on Earth'' and its connection to this west central Florida town. The Ringling Circus Museum was established in 1948 and was the first museum in the United States to document the history and grandeur of the circus, specifically, the Ringling Family Circus. Most of the items on display are from the early days of the circus though visitors will find a few modern items as well, and a forthcoming addition - set to open sometime in 2012 - will give the museum an updated look and provide visitors with a chance to be a circus performer and experience the magic of the center ring.'' That new exhibit will also profile the lives of some of Ringling's most famous circus personalities. Currently, the museum has a number of notable exhibits that are fun and interesting to view. By far, one of the most fascinating is The Howard Brothers Circus Model, a tiny replica of the Ringling Bros. Circus based on the era when the tented circus was at its largest, from approximately 1919 to 1938. The replica was produced by master model builder Howard Tibbals, who has been a life-long fan of the circus. Tibbals began crafting the replica in 1956 and it took 50 years to complete in its entirety, though it has been a part of the museum for many years. Tibbals miniature circus includes eight main tents, 152 wagons, 1,300 circus performers and workers, more than 800 animals and a 57-car train. It occupies 3,800 square feet inside a building named for the Tennessee philanthropist. Also inside the Tibbals Learning Center is an interesting exhibition of circus posters spanning decades. The poster was the best way for the circus to advertise the fact that they were coming to a particular town and several lithographers specialized in printing these colorful posters. The collection at the museum ranges from one-sheet posters of about 42'' x 28'' to enormous posters that may have been plastered on barns or on the sides of other commercial buildings, touting the circus' arrival. Guests can also view circus parade wagons, colorful costumes, and a wealth of photos from decades of circus history. Also on display is The Wisconsin, John and Mable Ringling's private rail car, built in 1905, and used by the Ringlings to travel throughout the country with the circus or on other business. A visit to the Ringling Circus Museum is included with general admission to the Ringling property, which also provides access to the other museums on the site. Tours are self-guided or docent-led."
"Ringling's Ca d'Zan Mansion is a Sight to Behold","Florida","Ringling's Ca d'Zan Mansion is a Sight to Behold","	Truly the most spectacular building in Sarasota, the breathtaking Ca d'Zan Mansion was the Florida home of circus magnate John Ringling and his wife, Mable. Purported to be the last of the Gilded Age mansions built in the United States, the home overlooks the waters of the Sarasota Bay and is undoubtedly the most photographed building in Sarasota. Construction on Ca d'Zan - literally House of John'' in Venetian dialect - began in 1924 during the height of the success of the Ringling Bros. Circus. It took just over a year to build this Venetian Gothic masterpiece and the cost at the time was $1.5 million. The home was designed by New York architect Dwight James Baum and was built by local developer Owen Burns. The Ringlings loved everything about Venice and wanted their winter home to resemble the structures they admired on their trips to Italy. They chose the Sarasota Bay location because the waters resembled those of the Grand Canal of Venice. In addition, design elements in their home were modeled after some of the great buildings of Venice, such as the Doge's Palace and the Ca d'Oro, a splendid 15th century Venetian palace. It is said that Mable Ringling possessed a portfolio full of postcards, photos, drawings, and other items from Venice that aided architects in the design of Ca d'Zan. The mansion is 200 feet long and includes approximately 36,000 square feet of interior space. It boasts 41 rooms and 15 bathrooms. It stands five stories tall and includes a full basement. The highest point of the mansion is a belvedere tower that stretches to 81 feet and includes an open-air overlook. Materials used for the exterior of the mansion include terra cotta T-blocks, concrete, and brick, covered with stucco and ornamented with shiny, glazed tiles. The terrace that fronts Sarasota Bay is made of both imported and domestic marble and the tiled roof is constructed of 16th century tiles imported from Spain. Inside, deep reds and gold dominate the d,cor. Reproduction Louis XV furnishings bought from major auction houses in New York are resplendent and indicative of the opulence of the Gilded Age. About 95 percent of what visitors see today are original pieces purchased by Mable. Artwork is everywhere inside the home as the Ringling's were major collectors of art. Pieces include not only paintings and sculpture but also tapestries that span several centuries. Even the insides of closets were hand-painted with bucolic scenes of the Venetian countryside. Mable Ringling died in 1929 and John in 1936. Ca d'Zan became the property of the state in 1946, after much red tape. Unfortunately, between that time and the 1990s, little was done to preserve the historic structure. However, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Thankfully, a $15 million restoration project was initiated in 1996 and completed in 2002, and the building was repaired and restored to - for the most part - its original state. Today, visitors can enjoy docent-led tours of the mansion, narrated by museum aficionados who can share colorful anecdotal stories about the circus magnate and his wife. It remains one of Florida's most visited attractions."

"Rosemary Beach is One of Panama City's Newer Communities","Florida","Rosemary Beach is One of Panama City's Newer Communities","	A young, urban beach community situated at the eastern end of Scenic Route 30A between Panama City and Destin, Florida, Rosemary Beach was established in the mid 1990s. The town was the brainchild of the Rosemary Beach Land Company and its president Patrick Bienvenue and is best described as a neo-classical beach town. The town of Rosemary Beach sits on 107 acres and is fronted by the Gulf of Mexico. Its creators designed it around the principals of community, neighborhood, and convenience'' - place where residents could both live and work. This traditional town was created by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, FAIA, and was designed as a contrast to suburban areas where residents are largely dependent on their automobiles to get around from place to place, even within their own community. In Rosemary Beach, the town was laid out so that residents and visitors could take advantage of an extensive network of foot paths and boardwalks to get around the community. Most of the neighborhoods within the town are connected by pedestrian walkways and those same paths lead to the community's amenities, such as the town square - featuring shops, markets, banks, and more, the community swimming pool and tennis courts, and the pristine beach. The town was designed so that everything could be reached on foot in five minutes of less. Cars are restricted to the alley ways that are located behind the community's homes. Unlike some planned communities, the homes found in Rosemary Beach are of a variety of styles. Original owners had the opportunity to choose from 12 different architectural plans. However, these homes are not carbon copies of each other but, rather, each of them was designed to include custom touches according to the owner's preferences and lifestyle needs. Homes were constructed of materials that matched the beach atmosphere of the town and would be able to withstand the sometimes harsh beach environment. Houses are finished in natural tones with wood siding or stucco finishes and attractive shake roofs. Porches and courtyards are common amenities in Rosemary Beach homes. Throughout the community, residents can take advantage of common green areas. These parks include areas for relaxing, picnics, and play. Many include fountains, shaded seating areas, arbors, and places for outdoor concerts. In addition, the creators of Rosemary Beach included plans for a Butterfly Garden, located in the northwest corner of the community. A wooden walkway leads through lush tropical plantings where butterflies of many varieties gather. The community also boasts a 2.3 mile fitness trail which includes four fitness stations and equipment for strength training and stretching. Dune walkovers protect the fragile dune system near Rosemary Beach and provide residents easy and safe access to the beach and the Gulf of Mexico."

Located just south of Sarasota proper, below the town of Osprey, Sarasota Jungle Gardens is set on 10 lush acres that was once home to a swampy banana grove. The land was purchased in the early 1930s by newspaperman David Breed Lindsay, who dreamed of turning it into a botanical garden for his own enjoyment. Lindsay and his neighbor/partner, Pearson Conrad, planted thousands of trees, plants, and flowers from around the world and, in 1936, began to charge people for visiting the garden. The official opening of Sarasota Jungle Gardens occurred four years later, even though Lindsay had never meant the area to become a tourist attraction. Many of the birds that fly around this Sarasota attraction are exotic birds that were abandoned by their owners or given to the gardens when the owner could no longer care for them. Many of the animals were sick or injured when arriving at the gardens and were rehabilitated at the expense of the gardens' owner, which has changed several times since 1940. While the Sarasota Jungle Gardens cannot accept all animals offered to them, one of their goals is to educate owners and potential owners of exotic pets as to their care. Visitors to the gardens are free to roam the attraction on their own or may take advantage of the many pet shows offered several times each day. A fascinating Birds of Prey'' exhibition profiles the predator birds that have been rescued by the facility. Audience members not only get to watch the birds in flight but are also educated by garden staff as to facts and fiction about these ominous birds. Another bird show, Birds of the Rainforest'', focuses on Sarasota Jungle Gardens' exotic birds, like macaws, parrots, toucans, and other similar creatures. Additional daily shows profile Florida's reptilian residents, like alligators and crocodiles, and the other critters that live in the gardens, including snakes and small mammals. Animal keepers are on hand at the shows and throughout the park to answer visitors' questions.

Long a favorite area beach, it was totally redeveloped in 2001 to improve its facilities and make it handicapped accessible Boasting emerald-colored waters and a wide expanse of deep sand, Sombrero Beach is located on the ocean side and sits about 2 miles off the highway, making it quieter and more far-removed than most of the beaches in the Florida Keys, away from the noise of drive-by traffic. Near the shoreline, the water is shallow and is appropriate for young children and non-swimmers. However, deeper waters also accommodate experienced swimmers looking for a more invigorating experience. The beach is surrounded by water on two sides - the west and the south - providing plenty of space to swim and a good spot from which to watch the sun set in the West.

"South Beach is Miami Beach's Place to See and Be Seen","Florida","South Beach is Miami Beach's Place to See and Be Seen","	Considered the most desirable section of Miami Beach, South Beach encompasses the 23 southernmost blocks on the island. Its east-west boundaries are normally defined as between First Street and Lincoln Road (between 16th and 17th) and the neighborhood encompasses thirteen principal north-south roads. The northern boundary is generally described as Dade Boulevard from Lincoln Road on the bay side of the island and, on the ocean side, 23rd Street. South Beach was the first section of Miami Beach to be developed, much of which occurred shortly after the island was connected to the mainland via the Collins Bridge (now Venetian Causeway) in 1913. South Beach saw a huge increase in population in the 1920s and many of the country's most well-known millionaires flocked to Miami Beach to purchase a home in this up-and-coming neighborhood. The 1930s brought the Art Deco movement to South Beach and today the neighborhood still boasts the largest collection of Streamline Moderne Art Deco architecture of anywhere in the world. This late form of Art Deco design features curving forms, long horizontal lines, and nautical elements like porthole windows or cruise ship-style railings. Jackie Gleason brought his weekly variety show to South Beach in 1966, providing yet more publicity for the area. However, shortly after, the neighborhood changed from a chic locale to a retirement community that housed mostly elderly individuals on fixed incomes. Buildings went into quick decline and the crime rate in South Beach soared until the television show Miami Vice, which used South Beach as a backdrop, brought pubic attention to the art deco gem. A renaissance began in the late 1980s, and today South Beach is considered Miami's major entertainment district. South Beach is a virtual melting pot, attracting not only wealthy Americans but also large numbers of well-to-do visitors from Europe, Israel, South America (particularly Brazil), Latin America, and the Caribbean. Many own second homes in South Beach and it's not unusual to walk down the street and hear a variety of different languages spoken. The beaches at South Beach, particularly Lummus Park Beach (aka Glitter Beach), are said to be the desired leisure area for Miami's most beautiful tanned bodies, including the large number of models that have made their home in this neighborhood, largely due to the popularity of South Beach as a place for photo shoots. Along the beach, visitors will also find some of the world's most unique lifeguard stands, created by architect William Lane and placed on the sand after 1992's Hurricane Andrew destroyed much of the area. While there are plenty of residential areas in South Beach, ranging from low- and high-rise apartments to single family homes, the neighborhood is really best known as an entertainment mecca. During the day, shopping is king and visitors and residents flock to Espanola Way and Lincoln Road pedestrian malls to enjoy upscale shopping, art galleries, and their choice of cafes and restaurants. At night, the club scene is hopping. About 150 clubs are open in South Beach at any one time, though the local Chamber of Commerce notes that many are short-lived. Most of the time, visitors need a connection to gain entrance to the club or must wait several hours and pass muster with the door staff in order to be admitted to these exclusive enclaves."

"Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club","Florida","Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club, Haines City, Florida - One of the Most Unique Golf Courses in Central Florida","Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club was built on the site of an orange grove killed by frost in the 1980s. As a result, the base soil is pure sand with a distinctive orange color, and features some natural elevation changes. Designed by Steve Smyers, the sand made for an easy material to move, which led to a design featuring numerous mounds, ridges and hollows. In other words, a highly contoured course with a sculpted'' feel about it, as well as a great deal of movement and swale. The 18-hole, par-72 Southern Dunes plays to 7,227 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.7 and a slope rating of 135. From the White tees, the course plays to a much shorter 6,298 yards, so most golfers will consider playing from the Blue tees. Southern Dunes is a dramatic hillside layout with 100 feet of elevation changes. Sections of the course lie below much of the surrounding lands and features expansive fairways and some 180 bunkers that tend to dominate most holes. The Par-3 11th hole alone features ten bunkers, giving the hole and the course ample challenge and a molten, bubbling'' look. Golfers must also be beware of the massive, high-lipped bunkers that appear closer to the greens. The native topography includes high grasses over sand dunes, and ornamentals that border holes that flow with the stunning terrain. Golfing imagination is said to be a highly prized playing trait on this course, as golfers can play bump-and-run shots and make use of the many slopes and contours to maneuver their ball around the course. The par 3s tend to play downhill, giving golfers great views of the course and some distinctive holes. Once on the green, golfers will encounter the large, fast, undulating greens for which the course is known. In general, the course has been described as a tough and challenging design that's also fair and fun to play again and again. As testament to its quality, Southern Dunes Golf & Country Club has been ranked by Golf Digest as #6 Best Courses in the State.'' The course has also been ranked nationally, receiving a place in Golf Week magazines Top 100 Modern Courses'' from 1997 to 2000, along with a 4 1/2 Star ranking by Golf Digest and a spot in Links Magazine's Top 100 Courses Built in America 1982-1997.

The marker is painted in yellow, black and red, features the insignia of The Conch Republic, declares it as the southernmost point and states 90 Miles to Cuba.

This concrete monument was erected in 1983. Though claiming to mark the southernmost point in the United States, this claim is actually not true. The true point is actually located on the Truman Annex, which is west of the marker. However, the U.S. Navy cannot be entered by tourists, so civilians would have been unable to enjoy the point. There are several farthest-south points including Fort Zachary Taylor Historic State Park, Ballast Key, which is Florida's southernmost point and White Street Pier.

After serving in WWII, and the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the ship went through a $2.5 million restoration in June 1985. In October, 1996, Captain John C. Timmel learned the SS American Victory was earmarked for scrap if not acquired for memorial purposes. Feeling that a museum would be feasible in Tampa, FL and that it would act as a purveyor or maritime memories, the ship was towed from Virginia to its permanent location in the Channelside District in downtown Tampa. Currently, the SS American Victory is only one of 3 fully-functioning ships in the country. Youth and adult tours are offered daily at the site. Children and adults can relive history as they learn and experience the ship and all that it has to offer."

The park hosts 9 miles of white, sandy beaches on a peninsula bordered by St. Joseph's Bay to the East and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. Originally the peninsula was inhabited by the Fort Walton indigenous cultures of Weeden Island and Mississippi, according to artifacts found within the park areas that serve as historic evidence of their presence. As early as the 1500s the Spanish arrived here and named the Bay; but it was not until 1701 when European settlement began with the construction of the Presidio San Jose Fort and a mission. That settlement was abandoned after only a few years. In 1868 the land here was bought by the Stone family, which sold it to the U.S. in 1940. The peninsula served as a military training ground until opening as a park in 1967.

The shopping area sits on a piece of property that was once owned by Frenchman Charles St. Amand in the late 1800s, who misspelled his name on land deeds, thus the difference in spelling. Circus great John Ringling, who kept his winter home in Sarasota, purchased the land in 1917 and devised a plan for residential properties and shopping areas on the Key. Ringling built a wooden causeway to the island and property sales were brisk. However, the Depression slowed the housing boom and the area was nearly vacant for almost twenty years, until investors began to revive St. Armands after World War II. By the 1950s, several stores were re-opened and the renaissance continued. Today, more than 130 stores and restaurants are neatly organized around a central circle, a plan similar to the one that had been imagined by Ringling. The buildings are a mix of Continental and Florida Contemporary styles with lovely tree-lined streets, comfortable benches, unique statuary - some from Ringling's personal collection, and plenty of tropical flowering plants completing the picture. The shopping area attracts large crowds of people throughout the day and evening, and is a pleasant place to stroll, window shop, or enjoy a meal. Many of the shops along St. Armands Circle are rather upscale, offering boutique style shopping in a pristine setting. Some names are recognizable, such as Chico's, Tommy Bahama, and White House/Black Market, while several of the stores are independently owned and operated and are one-of-a-kind. Specialty shops and galleries are commonplace and many peddle items, including jewelry and artwork, which are handmade by local artisans. The shopping area also has its share of souvenir shops (more upscale than the norm), book stores, and service-oriented businesses, such as beauty shops and travel agencies. Many locals and vacationers visit St. Armands Circle specifically for the dining experiences found there. At least a dozen restaurants and cafes can be found at St. Armands at any given time, some open for lunch and dinner, others open at the dinner hour and beyond. Choices include the famous Columbia Restaurant - Florida's oldest Spanish restaurant with entertainment including Flamenco dancers; Cha-Cha Coconuts, a St Armands landmark tropical bar and grille; and the elegant Caf, l'Europe. For snacks and a quick bite, ice cream parlors and other take-out eateries are available as well. St. Armands Circle is a popular destination year-round, often making parking in the area quite difficult. Visitors with dinner reservations should plan to arrive early and be prepared to pay for metered parking though there is some free parking available."

"St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park - Saint Augustine","Florida","St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park - Saint Augustine, Florida small, private zoo featuring alligators","The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park is one of the oldest animal-related attractions in the state of Florida. Founded in 1893, St. Augustine is listed in the National Register of Historical Places in addition to being accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The Alligator Farm is home to 20 species of animals including birds and reptiles. The Alligator Farm opened in 1893 as a small souvenir shop and museum at the end of the St. Augustine Railway. The owners of the farm added alligators as an attraction to entice visitors into the museum shop to buy souvenirs, but soon became the main attraction themselves. In the 1930s, the farm was relocated to its present location, and in 1937 it was bought by W.I. Drysdale and F. Charles Usina. The two young men began to expand the farm, but were struck by a fire that destroyed the main building of the complex. Undaunted, the pair rebuilt, and made plans to improve the property and the collections. Within a few years, they acquired collections from some of the best known zoos in the area. In addition to the alligators, the zoo grew to include ostriches, flamingos, crocodiles, monkeys and tortoises. Over time, the Alligator Farm became a focus of research on alligators, thanks to its ownership and access to some of the oldest known specimens of alligators living in captivity. Research based at St. Augustine's was published in scholarly journals around the world, as well as in popular magazines like National Geographic and Saturday Evening Post. The publicity drew more attention to the farm and to the plight of alligators, which were becoming an endangered species. After Drysdale's son took over the management of St. Augustine's in the 1970s, he added a nature trail and refurbished the exhibits, consulting with the Florida Audubon Society to make improvements to the rookery. He also added lectures on the lives and habits of alligators and snakes to the exhibitions and shows. In 1989, nearly 100 years after the zoo opened as a small attraction at a souvenir stand, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums awarded it accreditation. A few years later, the National Register of Historic Places added St. Augustine to its rolls. There are nearly a dozen exhibits at the Alligator Farm. They include the Rookery, the largest in the state of Florida. It includes egrets, storks, herons, ibis and other birds that populate the wetlands. The Rookery is part of the Alligator Swamp, home to over 150 alligators and many turtles living in about two acres of land. Other attractions include Maximo, a crocodile reaching lengths of over 15 feet and claims the title of largest animal in the park, and a new Komodo dragon exhibit. St. Augustine is open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM with extended hours in the summers. Admission is $21.95 for adults, $10.95 for children. Group discounts, educational rates and passes are available. For more information on admission prices and hours, call the Alligator Farm at 904-824-3337."

This places the inlet in Saint Augustine, Florida as a way to move from the intercoastal to the Atlantic Ocean or vice versa. The Inlet was first discovered by Spanish settlers who arrived from Spain to start settlements in Florida. The area of Florida was settled by Native Americans previously. These settlers may have used the inlet in order to fish and get from one side of the land to the other.  Today the inlet is used by vacationers and residents in order to get from one water way to another. It is also a place for mooring boats at nearby marinas. It is a salt water location given its placement next to the sea. Shifting sand has created a sandbar that is growing larger on the seaward side of St. Augustine Inlet. It makes boat navigation difficult due to the high sand. The coast guard has worked to keep the pathway clear given the need for larger vessels such as product ships to get through. Larger yachts have to be very careful or avoid the inlet to keep from getting damaged."
"St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum is a Visitor Must-See","Florida","St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum is a Visitor Must-See","	Situated on the north end of Anastasia Island, separated from the Saint Augustine mainland by the Matanzas River, the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum has been guiding sailors since just after the Civil War. The current St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum replaced an old Spanish watchtower that was constructed in the late sixteenth century, though it is uncertain whether or not the original tower, constructed from local coquina (shells), was used as a lighthouse by the Spanish. However, when Florida was ceded to the United States, the watchtower was indeed converted to an aid-to-navigation structure. Beach erosion quickly threatened the stability of the tower, so plans were made to replace it. In 1871, construction began on a new lighthouse, which took three years to complete. The old tower eventually fell in 1880, but the new one had already been in use for six years. A Victorian-style Keeper's House was built several years later and was the home of many a head keeper's and their families. The structure was updated with indoor plumbing in 1907 and electricity in 1936. The Keeper's house was electrified in 1925. By 1955, the St. Augustine lighthouse was automated and the need for keepers diminished. The Keeper's House was largely destroyed by a suspicious fire in 1970. Care of the lighthouse was assumed in 1980 by a small group of women from the local Junior Service League, who promised to keep it open for public events and heritage tourism. Their restoration efforts resulted in the placement of the lighthouse on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Today, the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum site consists of the 165-foot 1874 black-and-white striped tower, the restored 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens from the late 1800s, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks, and a garage that was housed a jeep repair facility during World War II. Now run by a community-based board of trustees known as the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc., in 1998, the lighthouse was the first in the U.S. transferred from the Coast Guard and National Park Service to a non-profit organization. Previous to that, however, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine was opened to the public in 1994. The museum serves several purposes. It tells the story of the nation's oldest port, it serves to preserve local maritime history and educate visitors as to the importance of the sea in the development of America, and also aims to promote the marine sciences to young visitors. The museum also employs staff archaeologists who have uncovered a number of wrecks in the area and houses artifacts based on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard along the east coast of Florida. The St. Augustine Lighthouse is said to be haunted by the ghosts of the two young daughters of the man who supervised the lighthouse construction crew. They drowned in an accident while the structure was being built. Visitors interested in paranormal activity can sign up for the Dark of the Moon tour to learn more about the local ghosts. Others may tour on their own during regular operating hours."

"St. Marks Lighthouse","Florida","St. Marks Lighthouse","St. Marks Lighthouse is located in Tallahassee and is a historic structure that guided sailors into one of the area's most popular ports. The town of St. Marks was historically one of the most important ports in Florida. It also served as the port for some counties in Southern Georgia. Sailors bringing shipments into town found that navigating the Apalachee Bay and the St. Marks River were a challenge. The river and bay were shallow and boats often ran aground in the area. In 1828, the governor of Florida requested a lighthouse be built at the St. Mark's location. Within a short time, the request to build a lighthouse was approved and construction began on what is now the St. Marks Lighthouse. The original lighthouse was not considered acceptable because it was not strong enough, so in 1831, Calvin Knowlton rebuilt the lighthouse tower. It was later that year the lighthouse went into operation. For years the lighthouse has stood as a beacon for sailors entering the St. Marks area.

"St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral","Florida","St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral","Tarpon Springs is known for elaborate religious ceremonies related to the Greek Orthodox Church such as Epiphany celebrated every January 6 with the blessing of the waters and the boats. Since the livelihood of the initial Greek immigrants hinged around the sea and their boats, their attachment to a religious service centered on requesting divine protection for what used to be a highly risky job can be easily explained.  The celebration attracts Greek Americans from across the country, and the city's population is known to triple in size for that day. The Metropolitan of Atlanta usually presides over the blessings, sometimes joined by the Archbishop of America. The blessings conclude with the ceremonial throwing of a wooden cross into the city's Spring Bayou, and boys ages 1618 dive in to retrieve it: whoever recovers the cross is said to be blessed for a full year. Following the blessings, the celebration moves to the Sponge Docks where food and music are made part of the festivities.

"Tampa International Airport - Tampa FL Tampa International Airport Flights","Florida","Tampa International Airport - Tampa FL Tampa International Airport Flights","Flying into the Tampa International Airport is something of a guilty pleasure. One isn't supposed to like airports. However, the Tampa airport has won awards and a large number of passenger accolades for the attractiveness of its architecture and the ease of navigation overall. The large windows and avoidance of underground tunneling take advantage of the warm Florida weather and keep the interior of the airport bathed in natural light for most of the day. Tampa has a long history as an aviation destination. It was the home of the first commercially scheduled flight, which took off from Tampa Field on January 1, 1914. Since that time commercial service has been consistently available, with demand frequently outpacing the facilities. As a result, the airport seems to always have at least one element under construction to keep up with the more than 20 million passengers who use the terminals annually. Tampa International Airport is currently in the process of upgrading the access roads and parking structures. The multi-year project launched in 2005 . . . .locals and travelers like to make bets for when it will be completed. As airport authorities would like to double the capacity of the airport but have to keep pushing back the start date for a new terminal construction project due to the US economy, the roads project just seems to go on and on. However, the roads project does not cause much in the way of congestion or delay. Travelers to the airport are much more likely to be delayed by a traffic accident on the causeway leading up to the airport than any construction work. At the airport, the color-coding system makes navigating the facilities easier than the numbered systems found elsewhere. This convenience must translate to the runways . . .Tampa has never experienced any crash or incident with any of its plane since it opened nearly 100 years ago."

"The Art Deco Historic District of Miami Beach is a Feast for the Eyes","Florida","The Art Deco Historic District of Miami Beach is a Feast for the Eyes","	Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Alton Road on the west, 6th Street to the south and Dade Boulevard along the Collins Canal to the north, Miami Beach's Art Deco Historic District boasts one of the highest concentrations of art deco buildings in the world. Miami Beach's Art Deco buildings are generally described as Streamline Moderne and most were built during the Depression years and prior to World War II. Characterized by symmetry, stepped roof lines, porthole windows, cruise ship railings, curved edges and corners, and lots of neon, this form of Art Deco came during what was considered to be the second phase of this architectural style and is in marked contrast to the first phase, originally devised in France and characterized by the use of expensive materials and elaborate motifs including fountains and often nude statues. Miami's Art Deco Historic District architecture, instead, is much more whimsical and includes features indicative of the region, such as palm trees and other flora and fauna typical of a seaside location. The Art Deco District of Miami Beach, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was threatened in the 1960s and 70s when the South Beach area had become run down and crime ridden. The area, however, was revitalized beginning in the early 1980s thanks to the efforts of Barbara Baer Capitman and the newly-formed Miami Design Preservation League, which spearheaded a campaign to save and restore the historic Art Deco structures, especially those located along Ocean Drive, Collins Avenue, and Washington Avenue from about 6th to 23rd streets. Developers were eager to step in, and before long, the area was the place to be in Miami Beach. The result was the renovation of literally hundreds of buildings, especially local hotels and motels, which are among the most ornate Art Deco structures in the area. Today, most visitors to Miami Beach make a point to tour the Art Deco Historic District. A good place to start is at the informative Art Deco Welcome Center, which is run by the aforementioned Preservation League. The Welcome Center offers maps and other informational materials about the district, sells Art Deco souvenirs, and also runs daily tours including those guided by local historians as well as self-guided audio tours available in several languages. A 90-minute cell phone tour is also available and is accessed via a local phone number. Cell phone tour participants have 24 hours to enjoy the tour from the time they initiate the first call. There are also daily bicycle and Segway tours for visitors of all ages. An evening tour highlights particular Art Deco night spots and gives participants an education as to the history of those clubs and restaurants during the early days of Miami Beach's population boom."
"The Beach at Daytona Beach is World-Renowned","Florida","The Beach at Daytona Beach is World-Renowned","	Touted as The World's Most Famous Beach'', the beach at Daytona stretches 23 miles along the Atlantic Coast in north-central Florida. The beach achieved fame in the early years of the twentieth century when automobiles were first permitted to drive on the white sand. The smooth sand at Daytona Beach quickly became a favorite place for pioneers in the new automobile industry to test their inventions. Automobile and motorcycle races on the beach began as early as 1902 and many land speed records were broken there during the first few decades of the 1900s, including the first in 1902 - clocked at about 57 miles per hour. The last land speed record set at Daytona before beach driving rules were changed was in 1935, when Sir Malcolm Campbell drove his vehicle, named Bluebird'', at speeds up to 276 miles per hour. Today, the beach at Daytona Beach still welcomes automobiles. During daytime hours, driving is permitted on about 18 miles of this long stretch of beach but only at speeds of 10 miles per hour and less. The remaining five miles of sand are reserved for pedestrians only. The beaches at Daytona are always free and are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to pedestrians, with limited hours for cars and drivers, which are generally permitted to enter the beach area from sunrise to sunset when tides permit. From approximately May 15 to Oct. 31, Daytona Beach also plays host to a large number of Green Turtles, an endangered Florida species. Established dune conservation zones protect the turtles during nesting season and driving in those areas is prohibited during this time. Visitors, however, are permitted to watch the sea turtles from a designated distance and the experience is one that beach goers don't soon forget. The beach at Daytona also has some excellent surfing spots, with regular swells and a soft, sandy bottom. The best waves on the beach can usually be found around Ponce Inlet and New Smyrna Beach. Several local shops carry the equipment surfers need to enjoy their sport. The Boardwalk at Daytona Beach offers a variety of food stands and souvenir shops as well as a plethora of family-oriented activities including miniature golf, arcades, go-kart tracks, water parks, and more. There's also an open-air band shell and other informal performance venues that accommodate live music concerts. The Boardwalk also has several piers that are occupied by amusements and midway games.

William and Marie, who hailed from the Midwest, came to the Sarasota area in the 1910s and purchased several acres of property bordering Sarasota Bay and Hudson Bayou. After decades of living in the Spanish-style home they built there and tending its ornate gardens, the property was donated to the community after Marie's death in 1971. Her wish for a garden built for the enjoyment of the general public'' was fulfilled a few years later. Today, Selby Botanical Gardens, at 13 acres (including the house), is almost twice the size of Marie's original garden, and after consultation with experts from the University of Florida and the New York Botanical Gardens, it was determined that these gardens would specialize in epiphytic plant - plants that do not root in soil, such as orchids, mosses, and bromeliads. This specialty sets these gardens apart from any other botanical garden in the United States. About 20,000 plants grace the premises of this colorful garden, including nearly 6,000 orchids. The facility is both open-air and under glass, so visitors can roam the expansive outdoor area and also explore the eight greenhouses located there.

"The Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg Houses an Impressive Collection","Florida","The Salvador Dali Museum in St. Petersburg Houses an Impressive Collection","	Located in downtown St. Petersburg, Florida, the acclaimed Salvador Dali Museum is home to the largest collection of works outside of Europe by Spanish artist Salvador Dali, a surrealist painter known for his highly imaginative and sometimes controversial works. The museum is the highest ranked museum in the South by the highly-regarded Michelin Travel Guide. The museum was established in 1971 with a collection that belonged to A. Reynolds Morse and Eleanor R. Morse, a husband and wife team of American industrialists who had acquired their first Dali piece in 1942. After more than a quarter-century spent amassing the works of the artist, who hailed from Spain's Catalan region, the Morse's decided it was time to open a museum using their extensive and varied collection. With Dali's blessing (the three had become good friends), the couple founded the first Salvador Dali Museum near their home in Beachwood, Ohio, an affluent suburb of Cleveland. In 1982, the Morses moved the museum to picturesque St. Petersburg. They chose an old marine warehouse in the downtown area for the site and rehabilitated it so that it was befitting of the museum, whose collection now totals over $125 million in value. Today, the Dali Museum welcomes about a quarter-million visitors each year. The permanent collection includes 96 oils, 100+ watercolors and drawings, and over 1,300 graphics, sculptures, objects d'art, and photographs. The pieces are displayed in the museum's six galleries on a rotating basis. Some are loaned to other museums for the purpose of temporary exhibits. Oil paintings held by the museum span from 1917 to 1970 and include works highlighted most of Dali's major themes. The works are diverse enough so that visitors can view all of Dali's painting styles, ranging from Cubism and Impressionism in his early career to his more well-known Surrealist pieces that were so prevalent in his mid to later years. His preoccupation with science and religion is also evident in the Morse collection. The museum also owns 7 of Dali's 18 masterworks, paintings that measure at least 5 feet in any direction and took more than a year to complete. The Salvador Dali Museum of St. Petersburg also has an extensive education department that is committed to offering special art-related opportunities to the local community and enhancing the public appreciation of the works of Dali. The education division offers free docent-led tours of the museum for a variety of age groups. An ongoing Dali lecture series is available for adults as are several film series and a Dali-related annual film festival. Patrons can also have Coffee with a Curator'' once a month or enjoy concerts that feature avant-garde or experimental music by regional, national, and international composers. Younger patrons can enjoy school tours, participate in surrealist art exhibits, or train to be a junior docent. The museum also hosts Breakfasts with Dali'' interactive family experiences that include tours geared towards children, as well as a community festival held each year on the anniversary of the museum and featuring entertainment pertinent to Dali's Spanish heritage. The Salvador Dali Museum, which is open daily, will be moving to a new home in 2011 at a location near the waterfront beside St. Petersburg's Mahaffey Theater."

"The Turtle Hospital in Marathon Helps Sea Turtles Survive","Florida","The Turtle Hospital in Marathon Helps Sea Turtles Survive","	The Turtle Hospital is a rescue, rehabilitation, and release facility for sea turtles, located in Marathon, a city in the central portion of the Florida Keys. This small, non-profit facility was opened in 1986 with a mission to rehabilitate injured sea turtles and return them to their natural habitat if possible, educate the public about turtles and other sea animals through outreach programs, conduct and assist in research that aids sea turtles (especially in partnership with local universities), and help promote environmental legislation that will assist in making local beaches and water safe for the sea turtles that make their home there. In order to accomplish their goals, The Turtle Hospital has amassed the equipment needed to care specifically for these fragile creatures. Some surgical equipment has been donated by local hospitals and doctors while others have been purchased by funds garnered from private donations or fundraising efforts. All the veterinarians and researchers here volunteer their time. Veterinarians at The Turtle Hospital and their assistants perform literally dozens of procedures each year on endangered sea turtles. The most common procedure includes the removal of viral tumors that regularly affect sea turtles in the area. Most other surgeries are to address injuries caused by negligence on the part of fishermen, boaters, and others who pollute the environment. Common problems include flipper injuries caused by fishing lines and trap ropes, resulting in the need for amputation. The sea turtles also suffer due to injuries caused by discarded plastic bottles, balloons, and other man-made items. In more than 20 years of service to the community, The Turtle Hospital has rehabilitated approximately 750 sea turtles, which are then released in a variety of ways in a variety of places, according to their species. The hospital also works closely with researchers at the University of Florida to address infectious tumors and other ailments that have greatly affected the sea turtle population around the world. For a small fee, which is used for rehabilitation and research programs, visitors may take a guided tour of the hospital and the rehab facilities. Guests will also be treated to a video presentation about the hospital's mission and will be permitted to feed The Turtle Hospital's several permanent residents. Tours are scheduled about three times per day and reservations are suggested as space is limited in this small facility. After visiting, guests may choose to adopt'' a turtle. This program supports the hospital's permanent residents, which are those that cannot be returned to the wild because of particular injuries that would make it difficult for them to prosper outside the walls of the facility. Guests are invited to pay a yearly adoption fee, which helps feed and maintain these turtle residents. Adopted parents receive a photo, a certificate of adoption, and periodic updates as to their turtle's progress."

"The Venetian Pool in Coral Gables is a Unique Historic Attraction","Florida","The Venetian Pool in Coral Gables is a Unique Historic Attraction","	The Venetian Pool of Coral Gables is a one-of-a-kind public pool located southwest of Miami, fashioned from what was once a quarry pit that had been mined for limestone. The only swimming pool on the National Register of Historic Places, plans for the building of this pool were inaugurated in 1921 by George Merrick, who is considered the founding father of Coral Gables, which is an affluent suburb of Miami. With the help of his artist uncle Denman Fink and local architect Phineas Paist, Merrick converted what he considered an eyesore to one of the world's most ornate public swimming facilities. The project was completed in 1924, originally called the Venetian Casino, and for decades - in additional to it being a swimming pool - the attraction hosted concerts, dances, and gala parties to which some of the country's most well-known celebrities were invited. The Venetian Pool still attracts approximately 100,000 visitors a year. Nestled in the midst of a residential development in this upscale suburb, guests come to swim in the pool's 820,000 gallons of cool spring water. Until the 1980s, the pool was drained nightly during the busiest summer months and refilled each day via its artesian wells, but is now replenished with water from these same subterranean aquifers that flow beneath it and can be recycled via natural ground filtration in order to conserve natural resources. The result, however, is the same - clean, fresh water each day. The pool includes a number of unique features. Swimmers can make their way through grottos and coral caves or can enjoy standing under waterfalls both large and small. The Venetian Pool is surrounded by open-air loggias and attractive porticos and includes a small palm-filled island, a sandy beach, and a picturesque cobblestone bridge. A poolside caf, serves light fare including pizza, hot dogs, sodas, ice cream, and other snacks and beverages. Patrons may enjoy the view while they eat. Just like any public swimming pool, the Venetian Pool offers swimming lessons for all ages, lifeguard training courses, and SCUBA certification classes during the hours when the pool is not open to the public for swimming. The pool is always manned by lifeguards so that it is safe for swimmers and non-swimmers of all ages. Seasonal or yearly memberships to the Venetian Pool are not available. Rather, visitors pay a fee on a daily basis, which allows access to the pool during its regular business hours on that particular day. Men's and women's bathrooms and locker rooms are available for use as are outdoor showers. More than $1 million dollars was spent during the winter of 2009 to upgrade many of the facilities to make them ADA compliant for users with disabilities. Funds were also spent to repair the pool deck and the pool itself."

Now, wayward shots are more likely to roll into difficult lies among more than 200 newly planted pine, oak and palm trees. Plus, the renovation puts the course's lower-level bunkers, natural waste areas, water hazards, and greenside chipping areas more in play. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,215 yards with a USGA rating of 76.8 with a slope of 155 from the longest tees, ranking it among the country's most challenging courses.

Currently, all other major league ballparks use dirt cutouts around bases and at pitcher's mounds. There have only been four other baseball parks that have featured all-dirt paths, including Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Houston's Astrodome and Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh. With a number of interactive programs for children of all ages, Tropicana Field offers a fun and exciting atmosphere for families. The Left Field Street area features a baseball-themed game show in which fans can participate.

The museum features exhibits that teach plenty about turtles like how they are used in cuisine, how they are canned and how they are hunted, facts that might be disturbing to some people. The museum gives plenty of facts about the history of turtle hunting, but acknowledges that the harvesting of sea turtles was abused, leading to a major problem. In addition to the exhibits at the museum, there is a video that shares the history of the turtle hunting industry. The museum is right near the Turtle Kraals Restaurant.

It is nine miles from downtown. The mound was added to the register by 1970 in order to protect the archeological site. It is considered the largest shell midden in the US on any mainland. It has a height of 50 feet and is estimated at 75 feet high before mining reduced it by 25 feet during the 19th and 20th centuries. The mound has 33,000 cubic yards of oyster shells. These shells are believed to date to the Timucuan people.  Archeologists have spent years studying the site. They believe the mound was used as a refuge during hurricanes given its height above other Florida land areas. Bows, spears, snares, and arrows have all been found on the mound. There are also mammals and reptiles that have been left behind. The mound was once used as a landmark for the Spanish. Today it is managed by the National Park Service as part of Canaveral National Seashore. Turtle Mound surveys have confirmed the presence of Sea Torchwood and other native Florida plants that are harder to find today."

"Universal Studios Florida","Florida","Universal Studios Florida - Orlando, Florida - Large Family Theme Park","Universal Studios Florida is a large, very popular, family-oriented theme and amusement park located in Orlando, Florida. The general theme of the park deals with Hollywood and entertainment - specifically the movie and television industry. As is the case with most amusement parks, a day at Universal Studios Florida revolves around the enjoyment of numerous, varied rides and attractions, as well as a number of free-with-admission entertainment options. This particular Universal Studios park is one part of the larger Universal Orlando Resort and is currently ranked as the fifth most visited theme park in America. One of the major features of the original Universal park in Hollywood was and is the studio tram tour. That tour takes guests on a journey through a number of different exhibits that include special effects set-ups, staged encounters with creatures like Jaws or King Kong, and actual sets that were used in well-known television shows and movies. Universal Studios Florida began with the development of stand-alone attractions based on some of these same elements of that tour - Jaws the Ride mirrors the real-time encounter with Jaws from the original Hollywood tour, for example. The many state-of-the-art attractions and rides continue to be the main draw for visitors when it comes to Universal Studios Florida to this day. In keeping with the scope of the park, all of the rides are entertainment -themed. However, not all the movies that have become attractions are necessarily part of the Universal catalog. Over the years, the park has licensed the rights to many other popular movies and television shows as well including Ghostbusters, The Simpsons, Men in Black, Shrek, and Jimmy Neutron. Some of the park's most popular rides and attractions were even developed with the help of the original creators of the films they are based on and in some cases even feature some of the stars that were part of the piece. For instance, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera personally appear in The Futuristic World of Hanna-Barbera. The Alfred Hitchcock feature, The Art of Making Movies features Anthony Perkins of Psycho fame. Thomas F. Wilson and Christopher Lloyd of the Back to the Future trilogy appear in Back to the Future: The Ride. These are only a few of many such cameos that help lend realism and credibility to the park's many state-of-the-art attractions. Like its sister park in Hollywood, Universal Studios Florida also serves as a working production studio. The production area of the park consists of six soundstages that have served a variety of purposes over the years. To begin with, it was the working location of Nickelodeon Studios from the years 1990-2005. It has also been the location of the Powerball lottery drawings since January of 2009. Other past or present features associated with these sound stages include Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, Wheel of Fortune, Fear Factor, the Ellen DeGeneres Show, and SeaQuest DSV. In addition to the rides, attractions, and studio, Universal Studios Florida is also home to a number of shopping and dining venues for the entertainment and convenience of park goers. For the kiddies, there are also a number of regular character appearances from well-known productions such as Shrek, the Hanna-Barbera franchise, and various Nickelodeon productions."

Two years later it was sent to Key Largo and deliberately sunk for an artificial reef. She sits off shore from Key Largo in the Atlantic Ocean a few miles south of Molasses Reef. She rests in 130 feet of water, with an average depth of 95 feet for the dive. As an artificial reef there are mooring buoys for dive shops and other boaters to use. It is an impressive wreck and reachable only in good weather. The Duane can have a strong current and high waves, thus dive shops visit it once a week and try to choose a day that will be best. Barracuda, sea turtles, cobia, and amberjacks tend to live around the wreck."

"Westin Innisbrook Golf Resort, Copperhead Course, Tarpon Springs, Florida - A Florida Golf Course Reminiscent of Carolina Courses","Florida","Westin Innisbrook Golf Resort, Copperhead Course, Tarpon Springs, Florida - A Florida Golf Course Reminiscent of Carolina Courses","Golfers may recognize the Larry Packard-designed Copperhead Course from seeing the PGA Tour pros play the Chrysler Championship each year. Unlike the typical flat Florida golf course, however, Copperhead features elevation changes of up to 70 feet, as well as fairways lined by pine trees and rolling terrain more reminiscent of Carolina courses. For the average golfer, Copperhead will prove a somewhat daunting challenge. The par-71 course plays to more than 7,300 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 76.8 and a slope rating of 144. The course features bending, twisting fairways that tend to be tree-lined and narrow, and the greens play very firm and fast. Though not particularly undulating, many golfers have reported that reading the greens is particularly challenging. The course is also very green and lush, as everything, including the rough, is over seeded every year. One of the most noteworthy, photographed and challenging holes is the par-5 No. 5, which plays to 605 yards from the back tees and a respectable 465 yards from the forward tees. The hole begins with a huge upward elevation change, then a dramatic drop back down as golfers approach the green. In between, golfers must hit a blind second shot over the hill, then find a green that slopes away on the approach shot. Another noteworthy hole is No. 14, a par-5 that plays to 570 yards from the back tees and 510 front the forward. This hole features of one Packard's famous double-doglegs, going right, left, then right again to the green. There's water on the right and a massive bunker on the left, and the green is two-tiered, meaning short shots will roll back down off the putting surface. According to stars, such as Ernie Els, Copperhead is the best golf course the PGA Tour plays in Florida.'' Curtis Strange seconded the notion, saying I could play this course for the rest of my life and enjoy it - it has that much character.'' The course is ranked among America's Top Resort Courses'' by Golf Digest and rated No. 4 in the state by Travel & Leisure Golf's Florida's 50 Finest. The course provides a complimentary practice facility located by the first hole, and lessons are also available. The resort also features a Pro Shop and locker room facilities.

"Wooten's Alligator Farm and Wildlife Sanctuary","Florida","Wooten's Alligator Farm and Wildlife Sanctuary","Wooten's Alligator Farm and Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Marco Island, Florida and gets mixed reviews from people who have experienced the attraction. The farm offers a combination package that includes a swamp buggy ride, an airboat, an alligator wrestling exhibition and an animal sanctuary. Some people have reported the term sanctuary is a misuse of the word. Those looking for an eco-friendly sanctuary will be disappointed. The space is small and the people who operate the facility aggravate the animals to make them appear ferocious. There is also a small pond inside where visitors are welcome to feed the fish while they wait. There are alligators in this pond, so be aware of where you children are at all times. It is an unusual attraction, so if you do not come to Florida on the regular basis or you are looking for something completely out of the ordinary to do while in town, this could be it. The wrestling is less exciting than you might think and the sanctuary is a bit run-down. The swamp buggy and airboat are reportedly a fun experience. Kids and adults are able to hold alligators, an experience that may only happen once in a lifetime. The cost of the experience is expensive, especially if you have children, at about $50 per person.

"World Woods Golf Club","Florida","World Woods Golf Club","The World Woods Golf Club is located in Brooksville, Florida, a semi-private pleasure ground designed by world famous course designer, Thomas Fazio. Its eighteen hole course provides golfers with a place to unwind after discovering the more than six thousand yards of golfing fun and beauty of its grass from Bermuda.

"World Woods Golf Club, Pine Barrens Course, Brooksville, Florida - A Golf Course that Designer Tom Fazio Considers His Best Work","Florida","World Woods Golf Club, Pine Barrens Course, Brooksville, Florida - A Golf Course that Designer Tom Fazio Considers His Best Work","When Yukihisa Inoue, President of World Woods Corporation, went in search of a golf-course architect with the ability to design a masterpiece, he chose Tom Fazio because of his unique style and penchant for utilizing the land's natural beauty, character and layout. The result is the visually stunning Pine Barrens Course at World Woods Golf Club in Brooksvile, Florida. According to Fazio, this is his best work. Joe Black, past President of the PGA of America concurred when he said, This is like having Pine Valley and Augusta, plus the best practice facility in the world - in the same location. The course, which takes its names for the numerous pine trees, was sculpted from a vast pine forest. It features some dramatic and surprising elevation changes, expansive, untamed waste bunkering that gives the course a rough, rugged look, and large, manicured fairways. It has been favorably compared to the Pine Valley Course in New Jersey, which is the consensus #1 course in the world. The course plays to par 71 and stretches to 6,902 yards from the longest tees. The course plays on Bermuda grass with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 136, offering a combination of intimidating and enjoyable holes. Golfers will typically find the course a solid test of both the mental and physical aspects of the game. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4 and 15, which have been rated among the most popular in Florida as well as some of the best strategic holes built in the last 60 years. Hole No. 4 is one of the most photographed in the state, which has been acclaimed for its scope and grandeur. The hole plays to 494 yards, which is short for a par-5. But a vicious waste area chasm, with a fall-off so deep that ladders are provided in places, dominates the fairway on the right all the way to the green. Hole No. 15 is a short par-4 that borders No. 4 and sits in a sandy bowl surrounded by trees. The green is located across water and a sandy crater on the right, and may entice some golfers to go for it off the tee. But the prudent play is to the fairway far to the left, which wraps around a series of bunkers and waste area short and left of the green. The Pine Barrens Course, which opened in 1993, has received other accolades as well, including being ranked #26 among America's Best Modern Courses'' by GolfWeek magazine. GOLF Magazine ranks it #45 on its list of best courses in the U.S., and #9 on its Top 100 Course You Can Play list. In addition, Pine Barrens also boasts what has been called the best practice facility in the world. The facility includes an expansive, 23-acre range with all grass teeing areas, an iron range, two greenside pitch and chip areas with bunkers, a two-acre putting green, along with a three-hole practice course featuring a par-3, 4 and 5. The World Woods Golf Club features a total of 2,100 acres of land, a second championship course, Rolling Oaks, and plans for a third. Plans are also in the works for on-site accommodations and corporate meeting rooms.

The neighborhood had features unusual among contemporary immigrant communities in the southern United States, most notably its multi-ethnic and multi-racial population and their many mutual aid societies.[1] A slow exodus out of the area that began during the Great Depression accelerated after World War II, leading to a period of abandonment and decay.

The land on which the ruined mill now stands was once owned by a US congressman/senator, David Levy Yulee, who bought the mill and its vast acres of property back in 1817. However, after marrying a Kentucky governor's daughter, he moved much of his existing plantation work closer to the nearby river, helping in the construction of some of Florida's 1st ever railroads. However, it was not until 1851 that he built the mill to process the sugar canes that he produced, which was operated by about one hundred slaves. It remained open till 1864 until the US Civil War when he used the mill to supply sugar to Confederate troops and his plantation house for stockpiling supplies and ammunition for the Confederate cause. Though US forces destroyed his home and imprisoned him, the mill survived. Today visitors can take tours of the limestone mill, which has undergone partial restoration. Its huge chimney is connected to a long structure that contains a forty-foot long boiler. As people take tours of the mill, they can also view the ruins of the mill's grinding type machinery.

Zoo World was founded in 1992 and attracts tens of thousands of visitors per year. Zoo World is also a member of the United Zoological Association (UZA) and is an active participant in the Species Survival Plan program (SSP). Zoo World Zoological Conservatory consists of seven lush, tropical acres surrounding a body of water known as Swan Lake. As guests walk the trail that winds throughout the zoo, they'll be able to view a number of regular'' zoo animals as well as others that are not so recognizable. This zoo is very well known for its large cats and, indeed, these animals take up a large portion of the grounds. Expect to see lions, jaguars, and tigers here, including rare white and Bengal tigers. Also near the cats are the giraffe habitat, a goat and llama area, a kangaroo habitat, and three primate islands that are home to orangutans, siamangs, and lemurs. On the opposite side of the lake sit some rarer creatures, perhaps not recognizable to many of the zoo's visitors. These include the spectacled bear (and other bears); kinkajous; mandrills; colobus, capuchin, and diana monkeys; servals (African wild cats); and a number of other small primates. Birds are also featured at this small but interesting zoo. Animal shows are a big part of the fun on a visit to Zoo World Zoological and Botanical Conservatory. In the park's Living Classroom, visitors can view shows like Parrots of the World'', a long-running demonstration that teaches guests about the science of training parrots and about the anatomy and culture of these tropical birds. The Going Wild'' show features the opportunity to get up close and personal with a variety of the zoo's creatures, ranging from reptiles to small mammals. Guests can pose for pictures with the animals as well. Wolf Encounter'' allows guests to interact with several wolves that have been raised at the zoo. This 15-minute program involves an extra fee, but those who choose to participate will have a private encounter with the wolves, led by a trained guide and photographed by the zoo's photographer. Children must be at least 10 years old to participate. Zoo World sponsors a number of special events each year. Their most popular, Zoobilee, includes entrance to the zoo for only $1 and a chance to visit the animals and participate in carnival games and fun activities. The Halloween ZooBoo allows local kids to go trick-or-treating at the zoo and also includes a costume contest. In addition, Zoo World holds summer day camps for kids from 6 to 13 years old, each lasting a week. Camps are available all summer long from the beginning of June until mid August. Internships are also open for college students or graduates and anyone over 18 may volunteer at the zoo after receiving appropriate training. A gift shop is located onsite and all proceeds are returned to the zoo to assist with its upkeep."
