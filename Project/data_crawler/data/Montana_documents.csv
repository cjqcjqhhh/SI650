"Berkeley Pit","Montana","Berkeley Pit - Butte, MT - Former Open Pit Copper Mine","Berkeley Pit is a rather infamous tourist attraction located in Butte, Montana. It was originally the site of a copper mine owned and operated by Anaconda Copper, and years later by the Atlantic Richfield Company. The pit itself measures in at an astounding size of 7,000 feet long, 1,600 feet deep, and 5,600 feet wide. Within its first year of operation, an approximate 17,000 tons of ore were extracted from the pit per day. It was fully operational from the time it was first opened in 1955 until its official closure in 1982. At the time of its closure, the customary water pumps located at the bottom of the pit were removed subsequently. As a result, it wasn't long before the pit itself filled with an estimated 30 billion gallons of groundwater that seeped in from surrounding aquifers. However, this seepage would soon prove to be the root of a rather disturbing problem. The water within Berkeley Pit has been found to be extremely toxic as a result of its seepage through and absorption of some of the highly toxic metals and substances to be found within the surrounding soil. These highly dangerous and poisonous substances include zinc, cadmium, sulphuric acid, and arsenic. Furthermore, the dissolved oxygen within the water causes many of the natural minerals and metals within the surrounding rocks to break down, releasing dangerous acids as a result. The estimated pH level of the water in Berkeley Pit is about 2.5 making it more acidic than beer, coffee, vinegar and even acid rain. The water in the pit is even rumored to be responsible for the deaths of 342 snow geese that landed on it in 1995. Obviously, the presence of such a situation poses major concern for the safety of the surrounding environment, as well as a threat to the purity of the associated groundwater. If left completely to its own devices, it's possible for the toxic pit water to begin seeping into the groundwater supply with disastrous consequences. As a result, the pit has been on the receiving end of a fairly extensive effort to clean it up and get the toxicity problem under control once and for all and is today considered one of the largest Superfund'' sites in the country. One of the most recent developments on this front was the construction of a treatment plant on nearby Horseshoe Bend. The plant not only diverts and treats water originating from the Horseshoe Bend flow, but it is expected to be able to further combat the toxicity problems within the pit as a collective in the future as well. Currently, Berkeley Pit is open to the public from March to November as a popular tourist attraction. For a small admission fee, visitors are allowed access to a viewing platform located above the pit the better to observe the infamous toxic location in person. There is also a Berkeley Pit gift shop located on the premises for the convenience of visitors."

C.M. Russell is renowned fine artist who dedicated his life to capturing the beauty and majesty of life in the West as it was during the 1800's and early 1900's. The museum's permanent collection alone consists of over 12,000 individual works of fine art and personal objects. The greater portion of these is encompassed by the Trigg Collection, a body of work considered to showcase the breadth and expanse of Russell's work to an exceptionally high degree. An entire suite of five corresponding galleries, collectively called The Art and Soul of the West, is part of the permanent collection and is devoted to Mr. Russell's work at various times of his life, introducing visitors to the artist one stage at a time. One of the five galleries is dedicated to the young version of C.M. Russell and showcases many examples of his early work, as well as rare sculptures, personal papers, and letters that offer visitors a personal look into the artist's early life. Other galleries document his first years in Montana and depict a myriad of sweeping cowboy, bison, and Native American images. Yet another of the five galleries, and one of the most popular in the entire museum, displays a collection of Russell's world-famous illustrated letters that he wrote to friends, family, and acquaintances. Also featured as part of the museum's extensive collection are works of art by many of Russell's most talented and well-respected contemporaries. These world- renowned artists include but are not limited to Winold Reiss, Olaf Wieghorst, O.C Seltzer, J.H. Sharp, and E.I. Couse.

"Cathedral of St. Helena","Montana","Cathedral of St. Helena - Helena, MT - Neo-Gothic Catholic Cathedral","Modeled after the famous Votive Church of the Sacred Heart in Vienna, Austria, the Cathedral of St. Helena was originally constructed during the turn of the century and Bishop John Carroll's episcopate. It is a perfect example of classic Geometric Neo-Gothic architecture. As such, it is revered by residents of Helena as a touch of the grandeur of Austrian past right there in the present in Montana. Its distinctive trademark double spires rise 230 feet above the level of the street and can clearly be seen throughout the local community, and the cathedral is still an operating place of Catholic worship. All visitors are welcome to visit the cathedral or attend services. The first Catholic services were held at the Cathedral of St. Helena in 1914 when the cathedral itself was first opened. However, it's important to note that the cathedral was not a finished building at that point in time. Completion of the cathedral didn't come about until 1924 when the German-crafted stained glass windows and finishing ornamentation were completed and installed. At one point, the cathedral also included a Catholic school which was operational from 1909 to 1969, but the school itself was recently demolished. The cathedral was severely damaged in the earthquake of 1935, but luckily was not left beyond repair. The fundamental structure was still very much intact, enabling the citizens of Helena to fully reconstruct it, preserving its historic significance and the beauty of its impressive classical architecture. At the time of its reconstruction, it was also equipped with earthquake-proofing reinforcement to prevent damage as the result of future quakes. The Cathedral of St. Helena is known as much for its opulent and impeccably artistic interior as it is for its impressive exterior. Visitors are instantly struck by its high, domed ceiling; hand-carved oak pews and woodwork; tall, stately pillars, and striking light fixtures crafted of hand-forged bronze work. The interior of the cathedral is further beautified by the presence of many statues hand-carved from pure Carrera marble and authentic gold leaf detailing throughout. However, one of the most famous features of the cathedral is its collection of beautifully crafted and intricate stained glass windows. They total 59 in number and were carefully created in Bavaria. Thirty-seven of the most popular and renowned chronicle the story of the church beginning with the fall of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and continuing on through to various events of the early 1900's. The Cathedral of St. Helena is to this day lovingly maintained by its dedicated staff. This includes meticulous care, cleaning, and maintenance of the cathedral's famous stained glass windows the better to preserve their incredible beauty. The cathedral itself also is still re-renovated from time to time. The most recent round of renovations (taking place over 2002 and 2003) saw the addition of a gift shop, a baptistery on the ground level, and a social hall on its upper level, as well as restoration of the sanctuary.

"Copper King Mansion","Montana","Copper King Mansion - Butte, MT - Historic Victorian Mansion Currently Operating as a Bed and Breakfast","The Copper King Mansion is an authentic, historically-significant Victorian mansion located in the beautiful city of Butte, Montana. It was originally home to one of Montana's famous three copper kings'', William Andrews Clark. Clark, along with his peers, is famous for contributing greatly to the development of industry in Montana as it is known today by way of his impressive ventures and success in regards to the copper business. By the year 1900, he had accumulated a staggering fortune in excess of an estimated $50,000,000 making him one of the wealthiest men in the world at the time. Building of the Copper King Mansions commenced in 1884 and finally finished in 1888, costing approximately a quarter of a million dollars in total. Today, the Copper King Mansion is occupied, owned, and run by Montana's own Cote family and has been for the past four generations. It is the only privately owned mansion that is open to the public. It is currently not only available for scheduled or summer tours, but it is also run as a bed and breakfast for guests seeking a unique, personal, and historic overnight experience. Proceeds from the tours, the overnight guests, and the occasional hosting of catered events are the mansion's sole source of funds. The Copper King Mansion is located smack in the middle of one of the country's most expansive historic landmark districts. It was also dubbed one of the most distinctive travel destinations in the country in 2002 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Over the years, the Cotes have taken great pains to keep the Copper King Mansion as historically accurate and close to its original state as possible. Much of the original wood workmanship and decorations are still in place with few exceptions. What was not originally a part of the house (in regards to furnishing and so forth) has been chosen for its similarity and historical accuracy, ffering visitors a look at the mansion that is very close to the way it would have been when inhabited by the famous copper king and his family. The woodwork - including the staircase, the floors, the fireplace, and the book shelves - feature an array of nine different woods and were all hand-carved and crafted by woodworkers of the period. The original chandeliers are all also in place with only two exceptions. One of the major decorative highlights to be seen within the mansion is the stunning collection of ceiling frescos Williams commissioned from artists of the time. Each room features a completely different one and to many visitors, they are the Copper King Mansion's crowning glory. The Copper King Mansion is also rumored by some to be haunted, adding to its appeal as a tourist destination for paranormal enthusiasts and ghost hunters. Although the Cotes do not personally believe this to be so, quite a few guests have reported witnessing or sensing paranormal manifestations. These include a coldness'' or chilly entity that resides in the game room; a cheerful, playful presence in both chapel and the ballroom; and hazy fog witnessed in the basement and also the ground floor hallway."

"Going-To-The-Sun Road - Glacier National Park -Main Highway Through Glacier National Park","Montana","Going-To-The-Sun Road - Glacier National Park -Main Highway Through Glacier National Park","Historic Going-to-the-Sun Road is the 52-mile main parkway through Montana's beautiful Glacier National Park, bisecting it from east to west and spanning the length of the entire park. It is, in fact, the only road that does so. Encompassing two lanes and carving a narrow, winding, snakelike path throughout the mountains, cedar forests, and valleys of the park, a scenic drive along Going-to-the-Sun Road is considered to be one of the highlights of visiting the area. Going-to-the-Sun Road was completed in the year 1932 and is the only American highway to be officially designated both a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark and a National Historic Landmark, setting it apart from all other roads of its type. It was also one of the first roads ever specifically built to cater to tourists traveling the countryside via automobile. As a nod to the era in which it was finished, a group of vintage tour busses was refurbished and restored in 2001 in order to offer sightseeing tours of the scenery along the road in authentic 1930's vehicles. Whether you opt to take the tour or drive it in your own vehicle, the road itself is peppered with turnouts and scenic stopping points to allow tourists and visitors to better take in the many spectacular vistas to be found along the way at their leisure. Going-to-the-Sun Road derives its name from the Going to the Sun Mountain, which is the key element of the scenery beyond the point where the road crosses the Continental Divide at Logan Pass. According to a local legend, the image of a Native American solar deity by the name of Sour Spirit can be seen on the face of the mountain itself, making it a popular sight for tourists to watch for as they pass by. Sour Spirit is said to have descended to the Earth to teach the Blackfoot Indians the fine art of hunting and then left his image there on the mountain to commemorate the event before returning home to the sun. In addition to the mountain from which it derives its name, Going-to-the-Sun Road also offers spectacular views of the full range of beautiful natural terrains to be found within Glacier National Park. A full drive along the entire road will provide an amazing natural showcase that includes cedar forests, glacial lakes, and alpine tundra vistas in addition to mountains and valleys. It passes several regional landmarks and points of interest along the way including but not limited to St. Mary Lake, Lake McDonald, and Heaven's Peak. Tourists are encouraged to travel the road in both directions to get the full effect of the landscape, as the view differs greatly depending upon the direction in which one is traveling. The beauty of the landscape seen from Going-to-the-Sun Road can also be seen in several major feature films. For instance, it can be seen in The Shining as the road up which the Torrances travel to get to the Overlook Hotel. It is also seen momentarily in Forrest Gump during Forrest's famous cross-country jog."

"Lewis & Clark Caverns","Montana","Lewis & Clark Caverns - Whitehall, MT - Montana's First and Most Famous State Park","The Lewis and Clark Caverns are most famous for being the state of Montana's first official state park and cover a collective area of 3040 acres at an elevation level of 4200 feet. Nestled within the impressive limestone cliffs just above the Jefferson River, it is also one of Montana's best known and most popular state parks as well. The caverns themselves are safe, electrically lit, and serve as openings to a fascinating underground world of natural caves that feature spectacular wonders such as stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, rock icicles, and frozen waterfalls. Visitors to the caverns are treated to a fascinating lesson in natural history, the science of geology, and the history of early exploration in the great state of Montana. The current name attached to the caverns is actually somewhat misleading, as the real Lewis and Clark most likely never visited or even knew of the caverns, let alone discovered them. The caves were actually discovered in the year 1892 by two hunters who are considered to be the first modern men ever to enter them. (Indian arrowheads have been found within the caves, indicating the presence of early Native Americans.) Later on, one of the hunters by the name of Tom Williams began to wonder about the possibility of developing the caves and began to explore his related options. The caverns were at that point equipped with wooden stairs and first opened up to the enjoyment of the general public. However, a dispute as to who really owned the property eventually sprang up between Williams and Northern Pacific Railroad. The railroad company took Williams to court and won, after which they turned ownership of the caverns over to the federal government. (It was at that point that the caverns were named after Lewis and Clark.) In 1937, the area officially became Montana's first state park. Today, the Lewis and Clark Caverns are open to the general public year round and are a popular attraction for people both within the state and from out of state. Guided tours are conducted during many the summer and autumn months, but visitors have the option of taking a self-guided nature trail tour of the surrounding area as well. (It is generally recommended that guests expect to devote a full two hours to their exploration of the caverns.) There is also a visitor's center, a variety of educational displays, and summer evening educational programs available for the convenience and enrichment of guests who would like to learn more about the caverns. Guests are also free to camp or stay on the grounds. There is a 40-space campground area available for the conveniences and comfort of the guests, as well as 3 camping cabins. (Camping cabins comfortably sleep up to four people and have a maximum occupancy of up to 6. However, amenities like bedding, kitchen facilities, and plumbing are not provided within the cabins.) There are also shower facilities, bathroom facilities, an RV dump area, picnic areas, fire ring, gathering areas, and concession areas provided. A golf course and several museums are located in nearby Three Forks for the convenience and enjoyment of the guests as well, providing enjoyable nearby entertainment for campers."
"Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument - Near Crow Agency, MT Preserved Historical Site of the Battle of Little Bighorn","Montana","Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument - Near Crow Agency, MT Preserved Historical Site of the Battle of Little Bighorn","Little Bighorn Battlefield is a national monument established to preserve the actual historic site of the Battle of Little Bighorn which took place on June 25, 1876. On that day, more than 250 members of the United States Army and their associated personnel died in a skirmish with thousands of Great Plains Indians who were fighting to preserve their way of life and prevent encroachment of the white men onto their territory. The site also doubles as a war memorial to honor and commemorate the sacrifices of those who fought in the battle. These include both members of General George Armstrong Custer's 7th Cavalry, as well as members of the Lakota-Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians who died trying to defend their land against invasion. The battle itself is also reenacted each June just outside the nearby town of Hardin, Montana. Little Bighorn Battlefield falls within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation near the towns of Crow Agency and Hardin. The nearest actual city to the battle field is Billings, MT 65 miles to the northwest. It is open to the public all year round, even in the winter months with guided tours available during the summer. A self-guided tour road option is also available to visitors and meanders between the two separate battlefields that make up the site - the Reno-Benteen Battlefield and the Custer Battlefield. Although camping and picnicking facilities are not provided on the battlefield itself, some traveling accommodations are available in the nearby towns. Today the Battlefield is maintained by the National Park Service and has been ever since 1940. Rangers are on the premises throughout the year to help educate the public about the battlefield. The guided tours - both self-guided and otherwise - are also designed to point out and illustrate all the major points of interest located on site as well. These include, but are not limited to the following. Weir Point: Marks the spot where Captain Weir ascended a hill in the hopes of pinpointing General Custer's whereabouts. Battle Ridge: The exact location where three of Custer's five companies finally fell and met defeat. Custer Hill: A memorial shaft and gravesite that bears inscriptions of all the names of the U.S. Army soldiers who died in battle there on June 25, 1876. Indian Memorial: A newly established war memorial erected to honor the sacrifices of the Plains Indians who died in the battle as well. National Cemetery: A small national burial ground where not only the soldiers killed in Northern Plains Indian battles and at frontier posts are laid to rest, but also some of the soldiers who died serving in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and both World Wars. Also located on the premises is a visitor's center and historic museum containing additional information for tourists and educational exhibits as well. These include displays focusing on the history of the battle itself, the lives of the Plains Indians, and a look at the arsenal of weapons used by Custer and his army."

"Logan Pass","Montana","Logan Pass - Glacier National Park - Scenic Pass Located Along the Continental Divide in Glacier National Park","Logan Pass is the famed scenic pass located just along the Continental Divide in the state of Montana's beautiful Glacier National Park. Visitors and tourists can easily reach the pass by following Going-to-the-Sun Road, the main highway that bisects the span of the park from east to west, up to the point of highest elevation of 6, 646 feet above sea level. Although this is the highest elevation that can be reached via automobile, higher elevations can be easily reached on foot via some of the hiking trails, such as the very popular Hidden Lake Trail. Due to the risk of avalanche, heavy snowfall, and general difficulty associated with keeping Going-to-the-Sun Road adequately cleared of snow and ice during Montana's snowy winter season to make it safe to drive, Logan Pass is not open to the public at all during the winter months. For instance, east of the pass itself is a spot known as Big Drift, which has been known to accumulate snowdrifts up to 100 feet in size due to snowfall being pushed over the Continental Divide by way of strong west-blowing winds. Although Logan Pass is hardly hospitable to visitors during the winter, it is nevertheless a popular destination for backpackers, sightseers, nature lovers, and wildlife enthusiasts from late May to mid-October, and especially during the summers when the weather and the scenery are both at their finest. The Logan Pass Visitors center is also open during the summer months to provide hikers and visitors with further information about the surrounding environment, as well as its ecology and wildlife, throughout the summer season. Further information about the various hiking trails is also available from the visitors center on demand. Hikers flock to Logan Pass to enjoy hiking excursions and take in the native flora and fauna to be found in the area. As the wildlife has become quite used to the presence of humans within their natural habitat, visitors to Logan Pass are almost guaranteed to observe animals such as mountain goats, pika, big horn sheep, and marmots. On occasion, grizzly bears and brown bears can also be seen, as they are also native to the area. The hiking to be experienced ranges from short to lengthy - from easy and light to very strenuous - so it can definitely be said that there is a trail there to suit hikers and backpackers of all endurance levels. The shortest, easiest, and most popular trail is Hidden Lake at a length of 3 miles round trip. Moderate trails include the 10-mile Siyeh Pass and Mt. Oberlin. Strenuous and challenging hikes for expert backpackers include Mt. Reynolds, as well as the 23-mile Garden Wall. In addition to the excellent opportunities for the viewing of wildlife in their natural habitats, Logan Pass and its associated hiking trails are also renowned for their scenic views of beautiful meadows full of wildflowers. Hikers will also be treated to opportunities to view and photograph some of Montana's most beautiful mountains and glacial lakes from numerous observation decks as well."
"Lonesome Spur Ranch","Montana","Lonesome Spur Ranch - Bridger, Montana - Fifth Generation Working Cattle Ranch","Located snugly between the Beartooth Mountains and the Pryor Mountains in Clarks Fork Valley, 45 miles south of Billings, the Lonesome Spur Ranch is a fifth generation working Montana ranch that offers guests the opportunity to participate in the day-to-day workings of an authentic cattle ranch for fun and personal enrichment. Visitors will also experience the famed natural beauty of Montana, as well as have the opportunity to observe many examples of the native wildlife within their natural habitats. Eagles, elks, whitetail deer, mule deer, and bears are only a few of the many species to be seen and observed. The Lonesome Spur Ranch was begun by the Schwend brothers Claude and Ed in 1906 on farmland they purchased located 4 miles south of Bridger, Montana. The Schwends were one among many families who first migrated to the west in search of new opportunities and unspoiled land, arriving in the area itself in 1888. Over the years, the land and the ranch evolved into the Lonesome Spur Ranch as guests know it today. Guests were welcomed onto the ranch for the first time in 1993. Since that time, people have flocked to the Lonesome Spur to share in the day to day workings of an authentic cattle ranch and take in the beauty of the mountain surroundings, clean air, and indigenous wildlife. One of the most notable of these guests was author Nicholas Sparks who stayed at the Lonesome Spur while doing his research for his well-known best-selling novel The Horse Whisperer. In fact, the Booker homestead in the novel and corresponding movie were modeled after the Lonesome Spur Ranch itself, bearing many similarities and common qualities. Open year round, the Lonesome Spur offers a variety of visitor experiences depending on the season. For instance, during the spring season, guests might find themselves being presented with the chance to help out with the birthing process and care of newborn calves and foals, while the summer sees such activities as the training of young foals and the surveillance of livestock that have been put out to pasture. During the winters, ski trips and winter horseback riding excursions are available. The members of the ranch itself work year-round on horseback and invite visitors to interact via hands-on participation in activities such as roping, sorting, and penning of livestock as well. There are also a wide variety of additional activities available to visitors to Lonesome Spur depending on the time of year. These include, but are not limited to tours of the Buffalo Bill Museum in nearby Cody, Wyoming; historical reliving and education in regards to the Battle of Little Bighorn; white water rafting trips down on the scenic Yellowstone River; and authentic rodeo shows. Lonesome Spur is also equipped with a spa facility that is open to guests and which they are invited to visit after a long day at work on the ranch or out riding. Massages, use of the hot tub, and hot wax treatments are all available the better to soothe the aches and pains of tired bones and sore muscles."

"Mount Helena City Park","Montana","Mount Helena City Park - Helena, MT - 620 Acre Park and Hiking Area","Mount Helena City Park covers an impressive 620-acre area that encompasses the monumental Mount Helena itself within its expanse. (Mount Helena measures in at a height of 5,468 feet above sea level, the park's highest point.) The park itself is cared for and maintained by the city of Helena, as well as through the efforts of local conservation groups and environmental trusts within the area. This includes the Prickly Pear Land Trust, which is a community-minded organization of over 700 members that has been committed to conserving natural, open spaces in several surrounding Montana counties since its foundation in 1996. Mount Helena City Park is open to visitors year round and is free of any and all admission charges.

The six trails are as follows: 1906 Trail: This trail offers hikers the easiest hike and the most direct route up to the top of Mount Helena.

The West End Trail: This trail treats hikers to a view of the most remote area of Mount Helena City Park, taking them on a jaunt through the meadow that lies just between Mount Helena and the next hill over. The Hogback Trail: This trail offers a more challenging hike that takes hikers along the Hogback Ridge from the peak of Mount Helena, treating them to a variety of spectacular views of the surrounding area and countryside. The Prairie Trail: This trail is recommended for hikers who were drawn to the park by tales of the beautiful wildflowers to be found in the area. It is said to be especially beautiful at sunrise and sunset. The Backside Trail: This is the trail to take for hikers interested in viewing the majestic Ponderosa pines that grow in the area, as well as the wide open, grassy woodland area in which they grow.

"Old Works Golf Course","Montana","Old Works Golf Course, Anaconda, Montana - The Only Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course in Montana","The Old Works Golf Course is not only the only Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course in the state, it also has the distinction of being the only course built on a Federal EPA Superfund site. Once, the site was home to Anaconda's century-old historic copper smelter, and Nicklaus made use of the existing elements to design a unique golfing experience. For example, the black slag byproduct of the smelting process is found in all the course bunkers and waste areas, making for a unique and stunning contrast to the white sand found on most golf courses. The material is said to be fairly dense and plays much like traditional sand, with a sand wedge the recommended club. The course also features the other elements you'd expect to find on such a location, including rugged-looking, copper-streaked hills, rock outcroppings and mounds, along with tall, native grasses and rolling terrain. There's a bit of water on the course as well, including a small pond and a lake around which several of the holes play, and Warm Spring Creek, which runs alongside several others. Some of the more noteworthy holes include Hole No. 4, a picturesque par-3 that epitomizes the namesake of the course. Playing downhill, tee shots must carry brown rough and rocks and aim for the green, with the mountainous, copper-streaked remnants of Flue #5 looming in the background. On Hole No. 6, the black slag used in place of sand is especially apparent, and golfers may find it a bit disconcerting to see so much black stuff lining both sides of this twisting fairway. The next hole is the longest par-3 on the course at 238 yards from the back tees, but plays slightly downhill. Similar to the previous hole, the green sits amid a see of black slag, making for a stunning visual sight, especially with the sun shining and highlighting the island of green at its center. Hole No. 12 is a par-4 that plays downhill to a bunker-less green, which is said to make judging the proper yardage more difficult. This hole also provides a stunning contrast, as tall, golden-brown grasses invade the green fairway from the left, while the 200-foot-tall cliffs that once separated the Upper Works and Lower Works loom on the right. One of the most difficult and picturesque holes at Old Works is hole No. 16. This par-4 curves around a small lake, then plays to a green guarded by black slag and the foundation wall of the old Silver Mill. In the background loom some of the area's small mountains. The Old Works course practice facilities are said to be the best in the state and include a 40,000-square-foot Bent grass teeing area/driving range with five target greens, as well as separate putting and chipping/bunker practice greens. There's also a three-hole practice course called the Little Bear Course, which allows players to experience actual course conditions before starting their round. The Old Works course also features a brick clubhouse, which houses a golf shop as well as a restaurant with beautiful views of the Anaconda-Pintler Mountains."
"Our Lady of the Rockies","Montana","Our Lady of the Rockies - Butte, MT - 90-Foot Statue of the Virgin Mary Overlooking the City of Butte","Our Lady of the Rockies is a colossal 90-foot statue of the Virgin Mary that overlooks the beautiful city of Butte, Montana from her lofty perch on the East Ridge of the Continental Divide. The statue itself was built as a monument to honor not only Mary, but also all women regardless of race, religion, or creed. (This goes doubly so for mothers.) She stands at an elevation of 8,510 feet above sea level, which is also approximately 3,500 feet above the elevation of Butte itself. Our Lady of the Rockies first came into being as the brainchild of local Montanan Bob O'Bill around 1979. At the time, his wife was battling cancer, so in his prayers, Mr. O'Bill promised the Virgin Mary that if his wife reached the other end of her battle safely he would erect a nine-foot statue in his very own yard to honor her. After his wife's recovery, he proved to be as good as his word and began work on the statue as promised. However, the original scope of the project was eventually expanded quite a bit. Instead of a statue to be displayed in a personal yard, Our Lady of the Rockies would instead become a spectacular mountaintop work of art that everyone could enjoy. Our Lady of the Rockies was made a reality completely through the efforts of local volunteers who donated not only their time and labor, but also the materials necessary to make O'Bill's vision a reality. These included Laurien Eugene Riehl, a retired engineer formerly employed by the Anaconda Company, who generously donated his engineering skills to the realization of the project. The volunteers as a collective were responsible for all stages of construction from blasting a path to the statue's final location in the Rockies to lifting the statue in sections to her permanent home. Today, the statue is maintained and cared for through the efforts of a non-profit organization. Our Lady of the Rockies has since become a popular tourist destination and a point of great pride for the local populace. The only access to the statue is via bus with tours running a few times a day during the summer and early autumn. Once there, visitors and tourists are actually able to go inside the towering statue and take a look around in much the same way they can the Statue of Liberty (and in fact the two are quite close in size). They are also treated to a viewing of a monument to women and mothers that has been incorporated into the base of the observatory. The names of 13,000 women who have passed away throughout the world over the years are carved there to honor their lives, as well as the mere fact of their existence. It was incorporated into the design of the statue to honor all types of women who reside all over the globe. Although there is not room for a gift and souvenir shop on the actual site, keepsakes are available to visitors and tourists through the Our Lady shop and office at the Butte Plaza Mall."

"Ready for a Great Bear Adventure in Montana?","Montana","Ready for a Great Bear Adventure in Montana?","Great Bear Adventure in Montana is a privately run park that allows visitors to see black bears and grizzly bears roam freely on the grounds. There are relatively few rules other than to stay on the path and to stay in the car. This allows people to get a closer view of bears in their natural habitats than is usually possible. The park is a well run and interesting, but the truth is bear can be see in many Montana wildlife refugees and state parks. It is advised to stay away from the bears due to the fact that they are territorial and fiercely protective of their young. There is plenty to do in Montana after viewing the bears in their natural habitat. Montana borders Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, and is the site of the Battle of Little Bighorn. All of these attractions contribute heavily to the tourism industry in Montana. While visiting one of the national parks in Montana you are encouraged to report all bear sightings to park rangers to keep the park open, and safe, for visitors from all walks of life. Whether a visitor comes to Montana to study bears or to explore the thousands of acres of wildlife preserves they may very well decide that they are going to stay. Few places in the country possess the natural beauty of Montana. Montana is home to roughly 950,000 people. The median price of a home in Montana in 2002 was $119,000 dollars according to a study down by the Center for Applied Economic Research at Montana State University. The mean annual salary in Montana was $28,670 in 2002 according to the U.S. Department of Labor. This makes Montana an affordable place to own a home. The people of Montana work in a wide range of industries including; ranching, mining, farming, oil exploration and drilling, lumber, and tourism. According to taxfoundation.org, a nonprofit tax watchdog group, Montana ranks 40th nationally in the tax rate. Residents of Montana can expect to pay 1.1% less in taxes than the national average. The business climate is also very friendly in Montana. The non-profit group taxfoundation.org ranks Montana as having the sixth best business climate for 2008. This shows that the State of Montana is more than a place for bear watching; it is also a great place to do business."

"St. Helena Cathedral","Montana","St. Helena Cathedral","Helena, Montana has one of the oldest churches in the state. The Cathedral of St. Helena was begun in 1905, when land was purchased for the church. An architect from Washington DC was sent to work out a design and begin building the cathedral. Von Herbulis was chosen because of his training in Europe where he learned about Romanesque and Gothic styles. By 1914 the first service was held in the church. It was not complete until 10 years later when it was finally consecrated. Earthquakes demolished a part of the church in the 1930s and reconstruction was completed in 1938.   The most recent work on the church was done in 2002 when Bishop Morlino decided the upper and lower levels needed to be updated with new social halls and a complete kitchen. Even the heating and chime system were replaced, as well as a new sound system. Mass is still offered at the Cathedral, so it is possible to tour the church or go to a service if one has a mind to. Mass is held on Saturdays and Sundays, and there are also daily masses. Sunday masses are 7:30, 9 and 10am, with a Saturday mass at 5pm. The daily mass is at 7am Monday through Friday."
"State Capitol","Montana","State Capitol - Helena, Mt - Seat of Government for the State of Montana","A perfect example of the Greek Renaissance movement in architecture, the Montana state capitol building is not only one of the major landmarks of the beautiful capitol city of Helena, but also the hub of government affairs for all of the state of Montana. Completed in the year 1902, and then expanded further during the years 1909 through 1912 to accommodate the growing demands of the state government, the capitol building itself is faced with a combination of sandstone and premium Montana granite. A striking copper dome is the finishing touch to the building's classically attractive design. Many areas within the state capitol building in Helena are open to the general public year round and guided tours are given on Saturdays according to a set schedule that differs according to the season. However, self-guided tours are also an option all days of the week except for Sunday. Informative booklets are available on demand from the information desk to help tourists and visitors find their way around and make sure they hit all the key points of interest during their stay. Upon first entering the building, visitors will find themselves within a vast rotunda - naturally the curved interior of the impressive copper dome seen from outside. It is beautifully decorated with majestic columns and striking painted works of art. The paintings were created in 1902 to showcase and honor the four distinct types of historical people that made the state of Montana everything that it is - the Native American, the gold miner, the cowboy, and the explorer. Straight ahead of the entrance the Grand Stairway can be seen, which leads up to a beautiful stained glass window - one of many visitors can expect to enjoy during their tour - while to either side of the main rotunda are two long hallways, one leading to the Secretary of State's office and the other to the Governor's office. The areas visitors to the capitol building will have the option to tour include not only this main rotunda, but also the Old Law Library, the Governor's office, the Supreme Court, the Senate, the Gallery of Outstanding Montanans, and more. Throughout their tour, visitors will also be treated to viewings of many incredible, important, and famous works of art as well - one of the primary draws of the building. These include not only paintings and photographs, but also monumental stained glass windows as well. One of the key pieces to be seen within the capitol building is 25 foot x 12 foot painting by the legendary Montana artist C.M. Russell called Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross's Hole. The canvas on which the colossal work of art was painted was so huge that Russell actually had to have the roof of his studio raised in order to accommodate it. The painting itself depicts the historic scene in which the famous pair asked the Salish Indians of Montana to show them the safest route to the Pacific Ocean from the mountains. Many history buffs and art enthusiasts alike flock to the capitol building just to see this famous painting. It can be found hanging in the chamber of the House of Representatives just about the chair set aside for the Speaker of the House."

"The World Museum of Mining","Montana","The World Museum of Mining - Butte, MT - Historic Museum Showcasing the History and Technology of Mining in Butte","The World Museum of Mining is an historic museum located in Butte, Montana. It is one of the few museums of its kind in the country that is actually located on an authentic historic mining site. The museum was first opened in 1963 and was the tangible result of ideas and brainstorming on the part of a civic organization called the Butte Exchange Club. As a result of the collective efforts of the community at large, the museum was able to eventually become a reality when in 1964 the Anaconda Company donated the location of the Orphan Girl Mine for use as museum dedicated to preserving the rich and interesting history of mining in Butte. The name of the site (Orphan Girl) is a reference to the way the original mine was more or less isolated in its position on the western half of Butte's mining district. Before it was officially closed in 1956, the Orphan Girl mine is estimated to have produced in excess of 7.5 million ounces of silver. The museum itself is home to an astounding number of exhibits revolving around various aspects of the mining industry in Butte. More than 66 of them are located in the museum's Mine Yard area alone, treating visitors to a look at a large variety of authentic mining equipment and machinery still in operational condition. The World Museum of Mining even features popular underground exhibits, archives, and tours. The underground tour treats museum patrons to a highly realistic and candid look at the Orphan Girl Mine from within. They're even fitted with hard hats, battery belts, and head lamps! There are plenty of interesting exhibits located above ground as well that cover many points in regards to the Butte mining industry. These include, but are not limited to the following. The Miners' Memorial Garden was built in 2008 to honor and commemorate the sacrifices made by miners who lost their lives on the job. Another exhibit is dedicated specifically to the history and origins of the Orphan Girl Mine itself and includes a look at the still-visible 100-foot headframe. Hoist House allows museum visitors to not only view exhibits, but also climb inside the very cages that the miners once used to travel up and down the shafts. The World Museum of Mining even features a faithfully reproduced 1890's mining town by the name of Hell Roarin' Gulch. Hell Roarin' Gulch include 15 historical structures still intact, as well as around 35 volunteer-constructed buildings, each packed with plenty of authentic artifacts from the period. Existing authentic buildings are also featured in Hell Roarin' Gulch. These include a school house, a superintendent's house, and two churches. In addition to the exhibits, the World Museum of Mining also features an extensive gift shop where visitors can purchase souvenirs, books, videos, jewelry, Montana-made huckleberry culinary treats, and beautiful copper items to take home as keepsakes of their visit."
"Tizer Botanic Gardens & Arboretum","Montana","Tizer Botanic Gardens & Arboretum - Jefferson City, MT - High-Altitude Botanical Garden Attraction","The Tizer Botanic Garden and Arboretum is the only botanic garden and arboretum located in all of Western Montana. It is open to the public seven days a week from mid-May to late September, offering visitors the opportunity to take in the beauty of thousands of different plants and flowers, as well as participate in a number of charming and popular events that the owners of the gardens organize throughout the season. The gardens are also notable as part of the Denver Botanic Gardens and Colorado State University Plant Select program. The Tizer Botanical Garden and Arboretum first came into being when amateur gardeners Belva Lotzer and Dick Krott obtained the property in 1998 and seeded the grounds with a variety of different wildflowers in an attempt to get the abundant weed growth under control. It wasn't long before the natural beauty and potential of their property blossomed and began to attract the notice and attention of surrounding neighbors and the rest is history. The gardens themselves cover a total area of three acres and are located at an astounding altitude of 5,000 feet above sea level. Visitors are amazed at the incredible variety of plant life that can be grown and maintained at such an altitude, making the gardens a popular destination for gardening enthusiasts, as well as nature lovers. Many of the flowering plants and trees included within are very rare and come from all over the world, even from areas as remote and exotic as Tibet. The property is further arranged into various themed gardens through which visitors and patrons are allowed walk and even stop for picnics. These include the Lewis and Clark Native Plant Trail, the Children's Garden, the Rose Garden, the Old Time Vegetable Patch, the Patriotic Garden, and the Herb Patch. The various trails that span the property will also treat guests to crossings over six different bridges, a stroll along the famous and beautiful Prickly Pear Creek, and a jaunt through the Wildlife Woodlands. Each one of the various areas is peppered with plenty of places for guests to sit, rest, have a picnic, or simply take in the beauty of the surrounding plants and wildlife. These include two historic cabins that were restored by the owners when they purchased the property in 1998. The largest of the two, the Goldminers Home, currently doubles as an event center, as well as a changing area for the many weddings that are hosted from time to time on the property. In addition to the hosting of private events and weddings, the owners of the Tizer Botanical Gardens also arrange and host internal events for the general public. These include three-course high tea events (to which admission tickets must be reserved in advance), a Mother's Day special event to open the season, guided tours, and even a scarecrow festival to close out the open season on a high note. These events, combined with the attraction of the property's natural beauty and rare collections of flowers and plants, has ensured that since its opening the Tizer Gardens have continued to grow in popularity as a destination, currently drawing up to 15,000 eager visitors a year.

"Two Medicine Dinosaur Center","Montana","Two Medicine Dinosaur Center - Bynam, MT (Nearest Choteau) - Non-Profit Educational and Research Institution","The Two Medicine Dinosaur Center located in Bynam, MT is a non-profit educational and research facility that centers around not only enrichment of the public in regards to dinosaurs and paleontological history, but also the preservation and museum-style display of actual dinosaur remains and other prehistoric artifacts. Currently, Two Medicine is self-sustaining and funded only through the proceeds it collects through gift shop revenue, private contributions, and visitor memberships. It was begun in 1995 by founding members that include David Trexler, Laurie Trexler, and Marion Brandvold and has been growing and evolving at a steady pace ever since. The Two Medicine Dinosaur Center has a number of unique and interesting educational displays open and available to the general public. These include a skeletal scale model of Seismosaurus built by Two Medicine paleontologist David Trexler himself. The model was originally created to give people an idea of what this dinosaur was like because no mounts created from real Seismosaurus bones currently exist. It was even eventually determined by the Guinness Book of World Records to be the longest dinosaur exhibit in the world. Seismosaurus is also currently the longest dinosaur discovered to date. Other exhibits include a display containing the very first juvenile dinosaur remains ever to be found in North America, as well as authentic remains of a number of other dinosaur species. Many of the exhibits are changed or updated on a regular basis. In addition to its exhibits, the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center is also known for the quality hands-on educational programs it offers to the general public. The programs are available in varying durations ranging from 3 hours to 10 days with costs varying accordingly. They are designed to focus equally on enrichment and fun, treating visitors to a variety of how-to lessons in regards to paleontology. The longer the program, the more deeply into the practice and science of paleontology participants will be able to delve. Participants are allowed to work directly alongside the paleontologists of Two Medicine and the variety of the programs is such that they have something to offer interested paleontology hobbyists and seasoned earth scientists alike. The experiences and subjects covered by Two Medicine's programs are fairly extensive. Some programs cover basic education in regards to the local area, general geology, and how to recognize various fossils. Some go one step further and include actual hands-on experience digging for fossils at active sites. Longer programs allow visitors extended access to sites and extensive experience working in the field alongside paleontologists, covering more complex aspects of the science of paleontology and fossil recovery. A week-long field trip in tandem with the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum is also available as an option. All programs must be signed up for in advance as space is limited. Also available for the pleasure and convenience of visitors to the Two Medicine Dinosaur Center are guided tours of the facility and exhibits. A gift shop is also located on site where patrons can help support the center by purchasing souvenirs to commemorate their visit."
"White Water Rafting Adventure","Montana","White Water Rafting Adventure","Included in the nation's Wild and Scenic River System, the Flathead River system features vast forests, mountain streams, and several endangered species.

"ZooMontana","Montana","ZooMontana - Billings, Montana - small city zoo and tourist attraction","ZooMontana is the only zoo of its kind in a 500 mile radius of its location. Incorporated in 1985 as a non-profit corporation, the ZooMontana set out to build a world-class zoological park and botanical garden for the Northwest area of the country. The group chose Billings as the site of its new project because of its location and its population base. The choice of location was a good one. Since its opening in 1995, ZooMontana has become the most popular tourist attraction within a 600 mile radius, hosting more than 70,000 visitors a year. The displays at ZooMontana are unique in that they are about 50% native to the region and 50% from other areas - but thanks to a decision made by the board during the planning stages, all animals housed at the wildlife park are from climates similar to the climate in the Billings area. This decision supports the zoo's decision to display animals in state-of-the-art naturalistic biomes where animals are at home and comfortable. The exotic animals at ZooMontana include Asian tigers, Sika deer and William and Taylor, a pair of Asian red pandas. The North American animals, on the surface less exotic, are no less interesting to watch and study. They include two pairs of Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep, one of the most social and gregarious herd animals of the American Northwest. Bighorn sheep are a threatened species, and efforts at ZooMontana and other zoos are attempting to rectify the status with captive breeding programs. Ramsey and Angela live in a state of the art naturalistic environment that is considered one of the best examples of its kind. ZooMontana is committed to providing education and outreach, and working with conservation groups. As part of the zoo's outreach services, it offers classroom visits and group tours of the zoo and well as Scout programs and volunteer opportunities for local residents. The Zoo also offers summer camps for kids, including week long conservation camps and one day Green Camps for parents and children. ZooMontana also offers outreach programs, taking zoo animals out to classrooms and groups in the community, and Trunk Boxes'' for teachers to rent. Each Trunk includes activities and lesson plans as well as animal artifacts that can be used in classroom teaching activities. Also located at the zoo are three special gardens designed for specific purposes. Dottie's Garden is a beautiful garden of drought and heat tolerant plants meant to educate the public about the value of planting drought resistant plants. The Sensory Garden is designed to appeal to all the senses with delightful scents, beautiful colors, and textures of plants and flowers. The Montana Garden is a native plant display that is built completely of plants native to the Montana environment. Garden experts are on hand to answer questions and offer advice about planting with native plants. ZooMontana is open seven days a week. From November 1 through March 31, the zoo is open from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and from April 16 through October 15, it is open 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Admission is $6.00 for adults, $4.00 for Seniors, $3.00 for children ages 3-15. For more information contact the zoo at 406-652-8100"
"ZooMontana and Botanical Gardens","Montana","ZooMontana and Botanical Gardens - Billings, MT - Only Zoological/Botanical Habitat in the Northern Rockies","ZooMontana is a zoological and botanical habitat and garden attraction located in Billings, MT. It is currently the only authentic zoo of its kind in the Northern Rockies with nothing else similar existing within a radius of 600 miles. Billings was chosen to be the zoo's location because of the area's economic and population status. ZooMontana was conceived as an idea in 1982, officially opened the doors of its 70-acre facility to the public in 1995, and welcomes an approximate 70,000 visitors each year. It is also boasts an official accreditation from the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, an honor bestowed upon only 10% of the nation's zoos. ZooMontana was actually designed to be less of a typical zoo and more of a pleasant, natural habitat for both the animals and the plants involved. Special importance was placed on the realization of an effective and solid nature conservation plan, as well as on the development of a complete world class education program for the enrichment of the public. Exhibits are created to be as natural and realistic as possible, treating visitors to a look at the animals in a setting that closely mimics nature. This is accomplished by cleverly separating patrons from the animals using strategically-placed natural barriers such as cliffs and ravines. Early on, a decision was made to include only animal species that would naturally be comfortable in the climate and conditions to be found in the Billings area. These not only include many animal species native to the Northern Rockies, such as bighorn sheep and bears, but also exotic species native to Northern Asia and Europe where the conditions are comparable, such as the red panda, the pygmy marmoset, and the Siberian tiger. The ratio of indigenous animals to exotic animals is roughly 50/50, creating a unique collection that is not only interesting and appealing to patrons, but also more cost-effective for zoo staff to maintain and care for. Currently the zoo contains quite a few completed habitats with even more in progress. Completed ones include but are not limited to natural exhibits for sika deer, river otters, wolverines, red pandas, bald eagles, eastern grey wolves, horned owls, bighorn sheep, and waterfowl. Scheduled enrichment activities that both benefit the animals and educate zoo guests also take place at regular times starting Saturdays at 11. These include demonstrations that allow visitors to witness animal reactions to stimuli such as scent, food, and specialized objects such as toys. In addition to the animal habitats, ZooMontana also features a number of beautiful and well-orchestrated botanical exhibits as well. These include the Sensory Garden, a 1-acre area with a wide variety of indigenous and exotic plants specially chosen for their abilities to engage all of the five senses; Dottie's Garden, a combination memorial and botanical project showcasing especially hardy species of Montana plants that are able to survive with little water and stand up to fluctuation weather conditions; and the Montana Garden, a work in progress offering visitors a chance to view, experience and learn about a variety of plant species native to Montana. Last, but not least, ZooMontana is also home to a charming early-century barn and homestead house. This has been designated a family area and features 11 different species of domestic animals such as rabbits, sheep, goats, and chickens. In the spring, visitors are also treated to a chance to view and interact with baby animals as well."
