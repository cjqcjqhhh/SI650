"Alabaster Caverns State Park Attracts Tourists to Freedom","Oklahoma","Alabaster Caverns State Park Attracts Tourists to Freedom, OK, Frontier Spirit and Hospitality Brings Them Back","Undoubtedly the main attraction of Alabaster Cavern State Park is the three quarters of a mile lantern-light tour of the alabaster cavern. Alabaster is a form of Gypsum that rarely occurs in nature. Selenite crystals of gypsum can be seen glittering throughout the cave. Huge boulders of pink, white and black alabaster fill the cave. This is the largest such natural gypsum cave that is open to the public on the planet. Tours are held daily each hour from 9am to 4pm, with an extended schedule in summer. People should visit the cave prepared for a good walk and cooler temperatures that average 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Those with respiratory of heart problems are discouraged from touring the cave, as well as those with serious cases of claustrophobia. Five species of bats live in the cave and in the evening enormous bat migrations can be witnessed in the park. The first recorded exploration of the cave took place in 1889. Charles Grass, who bought the land in 1928, sold it to the State of Oklahoma in 1953.  Later, the State established this 200-acre park. The park has many more attractions including another 5 caves that can be explored (with a permit from the park pending that the interested party has adequate safety equipment), hiking, camping, volleyball and horseshoes. Canyon trails and nature trails are also waiting to be explored. During the summer, a swimming pool is open on Wednesday through Sunday. Alabaster Caverns State Park is located just to the south of Freedom Oklahoma (about 130-miles northeast of Oklahoma City). Freedom was settled along the Cimarron River and is most known for its granite memorial to the Cimarron Cowboy. The monument is a series of etchings that depict the settling of the area by the early cowhands and lists the names of many of the area cowboys. The idea for the monument arose in 1947. On the Saturday of the rodeo The Great Freedom Bank Robbery and Shootout'' is staged by residents on the main Street, still reminiscent of an old west town. The robbery and shoot out enactment is performed on a volunteer basis as part of the town spirit and sense of community that is still alive in this old frontier town. Deer, quail and wild turkey continue to roam the surrounding habitat and like any true frontier town both fishing and hunting are major pastimes."
"Ambassador Hotel","Oklahoma","Ambassador Hotel - Tulsa OK - Ambassador Hotel Best","The Ambassador Hotel in Tulsa is popularly held to be the best hotel in the city. This has less to do with the price at the four star boutique hotel, and speaks more to the care that the 55 room boutique hotel puts into caring for its facilities and its customers. The architecture of the hotel is unusual, and so is the fact that it has consistently outranked every other hotel in the city on TripAdvisor and Expedia polls. The hotel is located downtown, offering guests convenience to go with their comfort. The property does not have a pool, but does have a fitness center. Eight of the rooms are actually suites, some of which have honeymoon themes. The hotel targets this kind of traffic, as well as the weekend getaway type leisure traveler. The older style of the hotel - a kind of classical European mixed with Spanish terracotta - is more suited to couples, adult travels and professionals than to families with children. As no hotel, even the Ambassador Hotel, is perfect, it is only fair to give warning about the toilets. Apparently they work on a kind of vacuum flush system which is surprisingly loud to many guests. No one seemed to report hearing it all over the hotel or being offended, just being surprised. You will have to try it for yourself and see what you think - just don't encourage small children to play with it! The hotel has an on-site eatery, the Chalkboard Restaurant, that is very popular with travelers. Special dinners can be arranged, and the staff overall earned high marks for accommodating special requests of all kinds. Housekeeping services can be scheduled, and chocolates are left on the bed during the turn down service. Small touches have earned the hotel a loyal following, so booking early for romantic and seasonal getaway seasons is advised."

"Riverwind Casino - Norman OK Riverwind Casino gambling music off track betting","Oklahoma","Riverwind Casino - Norman OK Riverwind Casino gambling music off track betting","The Riverwind Casino is based out of Norman and has recently opened its doors. It is Oklahoma's newest casino and the largest of its kind at 219,000 square feet. Owned by the Chickasaw Nation in partnership with Multimedia Games, it features 2295 slot machines, over 50 blackjack and poker tables, and off track betting.

There is a tri-level, 1500-seat Theater that features major named artists such as Randy Travis, Chicago, Little Big Town, and Boyz II Men. The entire establishment allows smoking, even in the lounge and theater areas. Visitors to the casino say that this establishment is very nice, featuring a large poker room and a good number of slot machines.  Some do complain about the current lack of video poker machines but these may be added in the future.  Many of the guests frequent this establishment because of the major named acts that perform at the casino. There are only a few complaints about the security outside the casino with some vehicles being reported as vandalized in the past, so guests will want to be sure to keep valuables out of sight. However, most of the reviews are positive. A major draw for visitors is how reasonably priced the non-gaming attractions are, and the amount of space that is available in all of the areas including the theaters.

"Science Museum Oklahoma","Oklahoma","Science Museum Oklahoma - Oklahoma City OK - Science Museum Planetarium","The Science Museum Oklahoma just celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008. The Museum was opened in 1958 as a way to expose locals to the wonders of space. Over time, the museum has developed into a forum to share the accomplishments of Oklahomans in space with the general public, as well as provide the opportunity for future education about science and culture. Some have criticized the museum as trying to be too many things at once, but all the different elements can be extremely educational. Exhibits were first known simply as the Kirkpatrick Planetarium. The Planetarium has had to move once since it opened, from a temporary home to a permanent dome at the Oklahoma City State Fairgrounds. Once it moved to the new dome, the planetarium attracted like-minded individuals and science organizations who helped to create many of the exhibits seen today. The Kirkpatrick Planetarium may be the oldest exhibit at the Science Museum Oklahoma, but some of the later exhibits have more elderly artifacts. The Red Earth Museum, for example, is located on the second floor of the museum and focuses on Native American artifacts and cultural achievements. The International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum focuses on photo-murals, including many very old prints. Younger visitors, however, are unlikely to be impressed by these more culturally oriented displays. They will likely enjoy the Photography Hall's mural of the Grand Canyon, and perhaps some of the tepees, but it would be better to focus on a Planetarium show or the lunar displays if children are in the see-and-touch stage. The lunar models on display accompany the Planetarium and are reconstructions of an Apollo Lunar Module. There is also an Apollo Command Simulator. The replicas were built by William Lishman, and can provide a lot of interactive discussion and opportunity. The museum is open seven days a week year-round. Visitors to the web site should note that it uses some advanced graphics and can be very slow to load; it may be equally time effective to call the museum directly for information at 405 - 602- 6664."
"Sheraton Oklahoma City","Oklahoma","Sheraton Oklahoma City - Oklahoma City OK - Sheration Downtown Hotel","The Sheraton Oklahoma City bills itself as the city's premier business hotel destination. It is a three star facility with more than 300 rooms on offer. The hotel is connected by an underground concourse to the Cox Convention Center. The concourse network also provides access to many of the other professional buildings of the downtown area, allowing guests to avoid the chills of the winter and the dusty winds of summer. The hotel gets high marks for convenience from visitors, many of whom use the hotel because they are attending a conference or meeting event downtown. However, several reviews indicated that although the hotel has a stellar location, the service leaves a little something to be desired. Several guests in 2008 found the hotel rooms to be less than perfectly maintained, and expressed frustration with staff on various issues. Sheraton Oklahoma City is located within walking distance of the popular Bricktown entertainment district, which is safe to go to at night on foot. Water taxis in the canal, sports venues, and dining options are the primary draws for this area. Conference and business guests particularly praised this aspect of the location. The Sheraton has a business center in the lobby, but does charge for in-room internet access. There are 17 meeting rooms available. 28,000 square feet of conference meeting space can be booked as well. All conference space needs to be reserved at least 24 hours in advance to ensure availability and technical support access. The hotel is non-smoking, and pets are allowed up to 40 pounds.

"Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum","Oklahoma","Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum - Tulsa, Oklahoma - city zoo with 1,500 animals on 78 Acres","When the Tulsa Zoo opened in 1927, the original director could hardly have foreseen its eventual success, but the Tulsa Park Superintendent Will O. Doolittle had every intention of building a prominent and adequate zoological garden and animal preserve''. The original zoo opened with about 35 animals, including a black bear named Bozo, a brown bear called Boxer and a rhesus monkey named Waco. The staff of the zoo consisted of just 5 people. In the eighty years since, the zoo's animal population has grown to over 1,500 mammals, reptiles, birds and amphibians. The zoo staff numbers in the hundreds, and the zoo hosts around 600,000 visitors each year, including 80,000 schoolchildren from the Tulsa area. The road from the 1929 Tulsa Zoo to today's modern showplace which is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums has been a long one of steady progress. The improvements to the Tulsa Zoo began early in its life. In 1929, the Zoo opened the Bird Hall and Museum to display reptiles and birds to the public. The unrivaled star of the Bird Hall was the zoo's Humboldt penguin. That year, the Tulsa zoo averaged up to 2,000 visitors per weekend. In the 1930s, the Zoo benefited from the CCC and the WPA, large scale projects to combat the effects of the Depression by building civic projects. The Crane Depot was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935, and the Koi Pond was built in 1939 by the Works Progress Administration. Both structures are still in use today, lending an air of history to the modern zoo and garden. Since the early 1990s, development at the Tulsa Zoo has been guided by a master plan which calls for aggressive construction of both public exhibits and back-end updates that increase the capability of the zoo to care for its animals. The most recent updates to the Tulsa Zoo include a penguin exhibit completed in 2002 and a state-of-the-art veterinary hospital for the benefit of all the animals. A visit to the zoo might include a walk through the Zoo's most popular geo-zoological area, the Tropical American Rain Forest. The exhibit allows visitors to wander along an enclosed path along the jungle floor, watching such exotic species as jaguars, toucanets, caimans, black howler monkey and anacondas. Birds fly overhead, taking advantage of a building that is 50 feet high at its center. Other exhibits at the zoo include the North American Living Museum, which consists of four buildings that represent the major regions on the North American continent, and the Africa Area, which includes a full-size replica of a typical Masai village. In addition to the animals and natural living exhibits, the Tulsa Zoo also features a snack plaza and a train that takes riders through the zoo for a different point of view on the animal displays. The Tulsa Zoo and Living Museum is open every day year round except for Christmas Day and the third Friday in June, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Admission is $8.00 for adults, $6.00 for seniors and $4 for children 3-11. Admissions are subject to change, and discounts may be available for groups. For more information on Tulsa Zoo hours and admissions, contact the zoo at 918-669-6600."
