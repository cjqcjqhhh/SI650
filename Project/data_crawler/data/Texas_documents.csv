"Alamo Village is an active movie set in Texas","Texas","Alamo Village is an active movie set in Texas","Alamo Village is located in Brackettville, Texas. The village was an active movie set and the first built in Texas. The set was constructed for The Alamo, the 1960 movie starring Wayne Richard, Farnkie Avalon and directed by John Wayne. Construction of the range began in 1957 by James T. Happy'' Shahan who Governor George W. Bush named the Father of the Texas movie industry'. The set was built on his ranch for John Wayne who had tried for several years to make the move about the Battle of the Alamo only to be successful when he formed his own production company. Filming of the movie began in August 1959. During construction of the set John Wayne ran out of money and construction was stopped. Shahan continued to work on the set while Wayne raised more money. This agreement was made if Wayne would allow Shahan to build full sets - four walls, floors and roof - rather then facades of the exterior of the building. To build the set over 1.5 million adobe bricks were required along with 14 miles of gravel road and a 4,000 foot runway. The set was a full scale re-creation of the Alamo compound as it was in 1836 and a representation of the village, San Antonio de Bexar. Once production of the film was finished, Shahan preserved the set so that more movies could be filmed on the set. Over 100 western movies, documentaries, music videos and commercials have been filmed at the site. The primary use of the village has been as a tourist attraction. A cantina and restaurant, trading post, Indian store, church, jail, blacksmith shop, a celebrity gallery and the John Wayne Western Museum are also located at the village. A large collection of antique tools, period props and vehicles are on show for visitors. During the Labor Day weekend the village hosts the Labor Day Horse Races along with many live shows and performances throughout the summer. Happy Shahan's widow, Virginia Shahan sold the village in 2004 for three million dollars. Virginia passed away in 2009 at the age of 93. The village closed temporarily while it was evaluated if keeping the village open was justifiable in the late 2000's recession. The village re-opened in 2009 only for Tulisha Shahan Wardlaw, Happy and Virginia's daughter, to pass away in September 2009 at the age of 67. Unfortunately this meant the end of an era. The Alamo Village had to close its doors and their website has been removed from the web."

"Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is a Lesson in History","Texas","Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is a Lesson in History","	Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is located on the Texas Panhandle, about 35 miles north of the city of Amarillo. Close to Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, this national monument protects the only exposed source of Alibates flint (agatized dolomite) in the country. Located near the Canadian River, the monument features 736 quarry pits that were essential to the lives of those who dwelled in the region as long ago as 12,000 years. These quarries contain colorful flint in hues of red, orange, yellow, blue, and green, considered by ancient civilizations to be among the best materials from which to make defensive weapons, such as arrowheads, and the tools essential for everyday living. Historians say the flint from these quarries may have been used as recently as the late 19th century, but today the fragile and historic area is protected from any form of excavation. The pits vary in width from five to about 25 feet and many were once as deep as 10 feet. However, the lack of use has caused several of the quarries to fill with dirt and vegetation, making them much shallower than in the past. The quarry pits, which sit on a hilltop overlooking the Canadian River, can only be explored via ranger-led tours because of the fragility of the national monument. Available by reservation only, these tours take visitors on a one mile hike to the pits along a moderately steep trail with loose gravel. Rangers are well-versed in the history of the area and will educate visitors as to the uses of flint and the history of the civilizations that inhabited the region. The tour takes about 2 hours and includes several stops and time to take photographs. Groups are welcome but should number less than 25. Additional self-guided hiking opportunities are available away from the quarry pits and wildlife viewing is quite popular here as well, with plentiful opportunities for photographing native roadrunners, antelope, deer, wild turkeys, and other animals. Those who wish to partake of water-based activities such as boating, kayaking, and swimming can visit adjacent Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, just a few miles from Alibates Flint National Monument. Lake Meredith also offers camping facilities and other amenities and activities. Additional lodging and food are available in the nearby towns of Fritch, Borger, and Stinnett. Because summers on the Texas Panhandle can be scorching hot, the best time to visit Alibates Flint National Monument is during the late fall, winter, or early spring. Because of severe weather, including tornadoes and high winds, tours can be cancelled with little notice. Visitors should call Ranger Headquarters before arrival at the park if weather is an issue."
"Almeda Mall - Houston, TX","Texas","Almeda Mall - Houston, TX","Houston, Texas is the largest city in the state of Texas even surpassing Dallas.

General Sam Houston had commanded the Battle of San Jacinto only twenty five miles from Houston. He was the President of the Republic of Texas, and this is how the city received its name. The port and the railroads helped to establish the city and when oil was discovered in 1901 the city's population really grew. The twentieth century saw the Texas Medical Center become a centerpiece in Houston, and then NASA built the Johnson Space Center where Mission Control for the space program is located. Besides the various industries in the city it is home to cultural exhibits and a performing arts district. One of the major shopping areas of Houston is the Almeda Mall.

"Alta Vista Neighborhood in San Antonio","Texas","Alta Vista Neighborhood in San Antonio","The Alta Vista Neighborhood has both charm and affordable housing. The area was founded as a working-class neighborhood for middle Americans. The first houses to establish the Alta Vista neighborhood were built during the Great Depression in the 1920's and 1930's. By 1956, the neighborhood was an established residential area and was beginning to blossom. At that point, the neighborhood was considered one of the best shopping destinations in the city.

There aren't very many windmills that still exist from those early days, but visitors to the American Wind Power Center will see some of them. Otherwise guests can only learn about these early power sources from pictures and books. The majority of the windmills that make up the American Wind Power Center came from a private collection in Nebraska owned by Don Hundley. Ms. Wolfe, an ardent follower of preserving this rich monument of history persuaded Mr. Hundley to sell the collection that now resides in Lubbock, Texas. There were forty eight windmills, one hundred and seventy one weights, fifty six pumps, models and photographs purchased from Mr. Hundley. Ms. Wolfe worked tirelessly to find a permanent place for the exhibit and in 1997 the City of Lubbock offered the section of land that the windmills are on today. Ms. Wolfe suffered a stroke and died before the first windmill was placed on the land. The American Wind Power Center has on the premises the WindSmith Academy which is an educational institution. They have classes periodically that last for two days and cover the basics of wind power and let the students actually climb the fifty meter Vestas wind turbine tower.

"Aztec On The River in San Antonio","Texas","Aztec On The River in San Antonio","It was almost a century ago that the Aztec On The River in San Antonio opened its doors. On its opening night on June 4, 1926 more than six thousand people gathered to gain entrance to the theatre; unfortunately, only 3,000 ticket holders were actually admitted. The theater's owners - Robert Betrum Kelly and H.C. Woods - spent almost two million dollars to create a technological and architectural masterpiece for that day and age. Aztec On The River theatre is ornately built with gorgeous columns, stadium seating, and intricate details that went into the construction of the walls, floors, and curtains. The owners even went through great lengths to install an elegant chandelier that weighed over 2,000 pounds. It was the largest chandelier to ever be placed in a theatre and was installed in the main lobby in 1929. The theaters crown and glory was the Wurlitzer organ which was used for old silent films (the organ has had continued use over the years). The theatre consist of a lobby, mezzanine, balcony, and main theatre floor. The first performance to ever be held at the Aztec On The River was a 26 piece orchestra. The theatre was not properly taken care of over the years and began to decline rapidly. By 1984, the theatre had become so dilapidated that it was officially closed to the public. The theatre was poised for destruction but the San Antonio Conversation Society stepped in and saved the historic theatre. The San Antonio Conservation Society is the oldest and most active preservation group in the United States and was not going to allow the Aztec On The River to be demolished. Eventually, the theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 where it could rest secure from future demolition plans. Over the years, the theatre experience has changed dramatically. Aztec On The River is now a premier destination in San Antonio thanks to renovation projects and entertainment that is designed for a large age range of guests. Some of the theatre's most noted performances included The Phantom of the Opera, Night of the Living Dead, Intervention, and a Migrant's Masterpiece. Various festivals have also been held at the Aztec On The River. Festivals such as the Charlie Chaplin Festival, San Antonio Local Film Festival, and the San Antonio Underground Film Festival.

"Barton Creek Resort & Spa, Fazio Canyons Course, Austin, Texas - A Tom Fazio Signature Golf Course in the Hill Country Outside Austin","Texas","Barton Creek Resort & Spa, Fazio Canyons Course, Austin, Texas - A Tom Fazio Signature Golf Course in the Hill Country Outside Austin","Barton Creek Resort & Spa can boast four championship golf courses designed by some of the best-known and most respected names in golf: Crenshaw, Palmer and Fazio. The first course to open at the resort was the Fazio Foothills, and he followed that up in 1999 with the Fazio Canyons layout. The Fazio Canyons course is located two miles from the resport proper in the Hill Country around Short Springs Branch, the creek with a limestone bed that wanders through the layout. The course is also lined with stately Sycamore and Red Oak trees and is said to be one of the lushest courses and best-maintained in the state. The underlying rugged terrain gives the course a good deal of character, as it winds through the canyon and up and down hills. There are both elevated tee boxes and greens, as well as numerous natural hazards, such as prickly-pear cacti and a variety of trees. The greens are also tricky. Though very large, they are said to be fast, undulating and difficult to read at times. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,153 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.1 and a slope rating of 141. While the locals have been known to say that the first Fazio course, Foothills, has more dramatic holes, they agree that the newer Canyons course is the overall better layout. It also has some noteworthy holes, including No. 9. This par-4 plays to 457 yards from the tips, which contributes to its ranking as one of the toughest holes on the course. The tee shot plays uphill, while a creek cascades down the hill from green to tee along the right side of the hole. No. 10 sets the tone for the back nine and is one of the signature holes at Barton Creek. Another long par-4 at 442 yards from the tips, this hole features a severe dogleg right that requires a tee shot to the left side of the fairway. From there, players must take aim at a very small green that appears to be sliding into a rushing creek that guards the putting surface. The finishing hole on Fazio Canyons is a par-5 that plays to 561 yards from the longest tees. This hole is said to rival the finishing hole on the Foothills course, and calls for a good deal of strategy. Water crosses the fairway twice and the hole plays downhill from the tee, giving players a number of decisions along the way. The second stream cuts right in front of a narrow green, and there's also a live oak just short of the putting surface that must be carried to get home safely. Since its opening, Fazio Canyons has garnered a number of awards. GOLF Magazine listed it among the Top 100 Golf Coures You Can Play in 2006, while Golf Digest ranked it #83 on its list of America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses in 2007-2008. Fazio Canyons is also home to the highly acclaimed Chuck Cook Golf Academy, which is ranked as one of the best golf schools in the country. The course also features extensive practice facilities, and has its own clubhouse with snack bar."
"Barton Creek Resort & Spa, Fazio Foothills Course, Austin, Texas - A Tom Fazio Signature Golf Course With Plenty of Visual Impact and Challenge","Texas","Barton Creek Resort & Spa, Fazio Foothills Course, Austin, Texas - A Tom Fazio Signature Golf Course With Plenty of Visual Impact and Challenge","Barton Creek Resort & Spa can boast four championship golf courses designed by some of the best-known and most respected names in golf: Crenshaw, Palmer and Fazio. The first course to open at the resort was the Fazio Foothills in 1986. The Fazio Foothills course features some dramatic fairways lined by cliffs and natural limestone caves, as well as waterfalls, and provides plenty of visual impact as well as elevation change. Fazio placed a premium in this design on long, accurate drives and, when combined with small greens with undulating aprons and grass bunkers, shot-making is the order of the day on the Foothills course. The course got an update in 2004, with Fazio representatives consulted on where to add yardage and tees to improve the layout and the challenge. The course also received new grass on the fairways and greens, while gaining nearly 200 extra yards. The 18-hole, par-72 course now plays to 7,125 yards from the longest tees. Most courses have a signature hole or two, but it's been said that the Foothills course makes it difficult to choose. Hole No. 9 is a dramatic par-3 that always gets some votes. This hole plays to 178 yards from the tips, making it a relatively short hole that also plays downhill. From the tee, players take aim at a split level green which is one of the largest on the course, but slopes severely from top to bottom. Tee shots must carry a casade of creeks and waterfalls to safely reach this putting surface. Hole No. 10 is a par-4 that also gets some votes. From the tee to the fairway there's a drop-off of nearly 100 feet and finding the fairway can appear daunting from the tee box. If players can avoid the water and sand on the left and a tree on the right, they have a chance of reaching a fairly small green and making a good score. Hole No. 16 also gets some votes. This is a dangerous par-4 that plays to 422 yards and is annually ranked as one of the pretiest and most difficult in the state. From the tee, there's a tunnel-like driving area that leads to a much more expansive landing area. For players who get a good look at the green on their second shot, they'll find the putting surface guarded in the front by a large, watery drop-off and a thunderous waterfall that can be a bit distracting when putting. The finishing hole at Fazio Foothills is a par-5 that plays to 560 yards from the tips, and always gets some notoriety as one of the best finishing holes to be found. Along the way, golfers will encounter an abandoned bat cave and an elevated green that's fronted by a canyon. Since its opening, Fazio Foothills has set the standard for golf at the Barton Creek Resort, and garnered a number of awards. The Foothills Course has been rated the #1 Resort Course in Texas for many years, and has been ranked as high as #4 in the country. It has also been host to the Champions Tour Legends of Golf tournament."

The ship was commissioned in March 1914 and is the only surviving US ship from both World War I and World War II. In 1948 the ship became the first battleship memorial museum in the United States, and was presented to the State of Texas and commissioned as the flagship of the Texas Navy in that same year. In 1947 the ship was offered to the state of Texas leaving the decision of where to house the ship with the Battleship Texas Commission. The San Jacinto Battleground was the chosen site as a constant reminder that Texans won their freedom from Mexico at the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836. In the financial year 2008 over 94,000 visited the ship, and it generated 57 percent of the total revenue at the San Jacinto State Historical Park. When the ship was built nearly 100 years ago the cost was estimated to be almost $11 million, which would in today's terms be in excess of $200 million. It is 573 feet long and in 1945 when fully fitted and ready for battle the ship weighed nearly 30 tons and could travel at a maximum speed of 20.5 knots. During its sailing life the ship is believed to have traveled 728,000 miles, which is the equivalent of 29 times around the world at the equator. At the French port of Cherbourg the ship was hit by a 280mm shell during a three hour battle. The Pilot House was wrecked and it damaged the Gunfire Control Booth injuring 11 crew, one of whom died shortly afterwards.

"Big Rocks Park","Texas","Big Rocks Park, Glen Rose, TX","Glen Rose, Texas is one of the smaller towns of the state. In 2000 the population of Glen Rose was a mere 2,122. To reach Glen Rose visitors must fly into Dallas/ Fort Worth and rent a car. The town is sixty miles from the airport. The small town has a fairly long history with Dinosaurs roaming the land, Native Americans inhabiting it, and finally settlers from the east creating a town in 1849. The area was a Comanche Indian Reservation in 1855, so the town founder left, but in 1859 the reservation was abolished and Charles Barnard moved back. Part of the attraction for Barnard was the Paluxy River. This river runs through the town providing a water source, as well as beautiful scenery. One of Glen Rose's attractions for visitors is Big Rocks Park. This park is town owned and therefore open to the public. There are no park rangers to watch over the park. Instead the town depends largely on visitors respecting the land and having fun while at the park. Glen Rose has many free attractions like the Somervell County Museum and Big Rocks Park. Any visitor to Texas who wants to save a little money can travel to Big Rocks Park. The park is set on Paluxy River where it is surrounded by trees and huge rocks. The rocks one can climb on gave the park its name. It is quite obvious why when visiting the park. The rocks are large enough for rock climbing explorations. Many local residents and Texans who enjoy rock climbing will come to this park. There are boulders for novices to learn on and then larger rocks to really enjoy a few hours. Some of the rocks are set in the river. Paluxy River took many years to form as the water eventually ate away at the limestone and other sediment in the land. As the water ate away at the sediment the rocks remained. So the river has to flow around the majority of the rocks. The river banks are a little steep in spots, more like a slide, but there are still areas for visitors to climb into the river and swim. For the most part the river is tame running slowly through the park. There are a couple of spots where rocks will cause a little wave action. On the whole though the river is calm for all swimmers, and parents are asked to keep near their children. It is also recommended to wear life vests for those who are not strong swimmers. Swimming is only possible in the warm months of the year. During winter the water is too cold to be comfortable. The rest of Big Rocks Park is going to be open all year round. With no fee, a visitor can go hiking, climbing, biking, or walking through the wooded areas. There is plenty of parking on site, and often in summer the river is full of swimmers enjoying a little cool down."

"Bob Hall Pier","Texas","Bob Hall Pier, Corpus Christi, Texas","The history of Bob Hall Pier in Corpus Christi, Texas is a bit longer than most piers. The first pier was built prior to the 1960's. Unfortunately Hurricane Carla swept through destroying the entire structure. It was made of wood, which made it susceptible to the storms. The second pier was built in the 60's. This time it was named Nueces after Nueces County Commissioner. Again the structure was made out of wood, but this time instead of 600 feet of pier, it was doubled to 1,200 feet. This made the pier the longest one on the Texas Coast. For five years the pier was able to remain as one piece sustaining itself against the tides and storms. Then in 1967 Hurricane Beulah came through the Coastal Bend. At this time the 1,200 foot pier became 600 feet. The county felt it was too short and a year later created a new wooden section 127 feet in length. The pier was most popular in the 1970's where over 3,000 people would come to fish and walk along it. In 1980 the pier was inspected for structural integrity. The seaward 150 feet section had quite a bit of damage. The end of the pier was soon closed to the public so that repairs could be made. For a while the original pier remained standing, but a new one was being built - the Bob Hall Pier. This new pier was built of reinforced concrete, and when Hurricane Allen swept along the coast the old wooden pier was demolished in the storm. A few wooden posts still remain. The new pier, which visitors and residents flock to each year, was designed like a giant Chinese puzzle. There are no bolts or pins. Instead gravity holds the pier together. It was originally thought this could be storm proof because the concrete deck squares can pop out and allow the rest of the structure to remain. The pier cost 1.3 million dollars and the Federal Government offered up the funds. The current pier was constructed in 1982, opening in 1983. There are user fees, which are kept in a special fund to maintain the pier and ensure it remains usable by the public. The pier is 1,240 feet long and 15.5 feet wide. It has a T-head at the end that is 165 feet long and 19 feet wide. The two main attractions of the pier are the Ozone Bar and Grill and Fishing. Residents of Corpus Christi head to the pier to fish from its deck. Quite often many different fish are caught and even sharks. At one point in history a hammerhead was caught on a fishing line. The Ozone Bar and Grill sits on the edge of the pier over the water. Guests can have a fresh sea food meal each day and look out to the horizon on the Gulf of Mexico. The place is definitely filled with ambience, and at night many couples walk along the beach and pier."

"Boquillas Canyon","Texas","Boquillas Canyon, Big Bend National Park, TX","Big Bend National Park in Texas gets its name from a u-shaped bend in the Rio Grande River that borders the park. This wilderness area has mountains and desert scenery and encompasses more than eight hundred thousand acres. The Chisos Mountains are fully contained within the park. There are three river canyons: the Santa Elena, Mariscal and Boquillas. The cliffs of the Santa Elena are 1,513 feet above the river. Fossilized bones of a pterosaur were found in this canyon. Big Bend National Park is open all year long and there are many hiking trails within the park. A self guided trail will take visitors to Lost Mine Peak. The trip is about three hours. Guided walks are available in the park and information about them is at the visitor's center. The visitor's center is open daily from 8:00 am to 6:00pm. The admission that is valid for seven days is twenty dollars for private vehicles. Visitors on bikes or a motorcycle are ten dollars. The park itself is open twenty four hours a day. Pets must be kept on a leash and aren't allowed in any of the buildings. Boquillas Canyon is the farthest east of the three canyons. This canyon is about twenty miles in length. It begins close to the Rio Grande Village which is a wild and beautiful point in the river. Boquillas Canyon isn't as deep nor has cliffs with the sheer faces that Santa Elena does, nor is it as jagged as Mariscal. If the water is low enough visitors can walk in the canyon; however, it is rare and most of the time a boat is needed for the deep, quick moving river. To get to the Boquillas Canyon visitors take Road 118 and go past the Rio Grande campsite. There is a turn off that delivers guests to the bordering town of Boquillas del Carmen, Mexico. The road showcases the high layered cliffs by the river. The mountains on the Mexico side are large and angular. This road ends in about seven tenths of a mile; the path leads guests over a stone ridge past a sandy area and onto a beach filled with pebbles by the river. On the Texas side there is a large sand drift made by the winds that blow the desert sand into the canyon. Visitors can go downstream only if the water is less than two feet deep. This area is about two miles in length before it can't be traversed. A path that has been made by mules and wild horses is alongside the river. The side canyon is a peaceful place to visit, but it is four river crossings and one and a half miles from the end of the trail. Guests who are in good shape and persevere can see arrow water carved channels and large boulders in the streambed along with bushes and cacti. Bring plenty of water to drink and fill your car with gas because the service stations in the park aren't open 24 hours a day."

"Cadillac Ranch","Texas","Cadillac Ranch, Amarillo, TX","The group known as the Ant Farm consisted of members Chip Lord, Hudson Marquez and Doug Michaels. This group was formed in 1974 as an art group. The Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas features a public display that is considered to be a sculpture. This art display is made up of older running used Cadillacs or junk Cadillacs when it was constructed in 1974. It is supposed to represent some of the evolutions of the Cadillac car line. They paid considerable homage to the tail fin of the Cadillac that has since been discontinued. It was on the vehicles that were produced from 1949 to 1963. The Cadillacs were buried engine first into the ground with about half of the vehicle still protruding. The angle that the Cadillacs were placed at supposedly corresponds to the angle at the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. The art work makes the statement that Americans love the mobility and freedom of the car and the idea of roadside attractions. When the exhibit was first erected it was put in a wheat field; however, in 1997 it was moved two miles to the west. It resides in what used to be a cow pasture that is closer to Interstate 40. They moved it because of the encroaching growth of the city. Stanley Marsh the Third is the patron of this project and many others around the city of Amarillo. Visitors to Amarillo can see the Cadillac Ranch from the I-40. The land that the ranch is on is private, but visitors are encouraged to stop and see the display. People would drive along the frontage road and enter through an unlocked gate. Graffiti or spray painting of the vehicles is encouraged. The original colors of the vehicles are no longer in evidence and are distinctive in their colorizations. Every so often the vehicles are repainted so that they can be used in a commercial or to provide a clean canvas for budding artists. Cadillac Ranch has been featured in the Disney and Pixar film Cars. Radiator Springs is shown on a map to be near the edge of Cadillac Ranch. Bruce Springsteen has a song on his The River album entitled Cadillac Ranch and it was used in an episode of King of the Hill. The Cadillac Ranch is tied to the old Route 66 highway and has also been used in several music videos. Other off beat places to visit in Amarillo are the Muffler Man which is about three miles from the Cadillac Ranch, the Helium Time Columns Monument four miles away, Guardian of the Arts six miles away and a swimming pool shaped like the State of Texas thirteen miles away.

Beginning in 2002, the zoo again underwent extensive expansion and renovations to bring it up to more modern standards. A new veterinary hospital, brooder house, quarantine facility and off-exhibit animal holding areas were constructed. Bus and visitor parking lots were expanded and new restrooms and picnic areas were added. Also during 2002, the Caldwell Zoo began an extensive breeding program for Atwater's prairie chickens. As a result of the breeding program, five baby chicks were successfully hatched and raised in the first year alone. The program showcases the zoos dedication to species preservation and research efforts. Other improvements made to the zoo have been the recent addition of a new entry complex, a lemur island expansion and a flamingo pool. The zoo has also received new members to their animal family, warthogs, wildebeests, ostriches and a wild bird aviary have all been added. The Caldwell Zoo is opened daily from 9:00 am until 5:00 pm during the summer season and from 9:00 am until 4:00 pm during the fall season.

"Cascade Caverns","Texas","Cascade Caverns, Boerne, TX","Cascade Caverns in Boerne, Texas was not always a place for visitors. Prior to the 30's the caverns were sold many times between various individuals. The first few owners probably didn't even see the caverns according to the history written about the place. It was not until 1875 when Dr. Benjamin Hester purchased the land with the caverns that the land was actually inhabited. His wife stayed there for a while after his death, but eventually Hester sold the place to LW Menn. This is when the cave became known as Hester's Cave. During this time some of the younger men would peek inside, even a few left their initials. By 1932 May Francis wrote a book calling it The Hermit of the Cavern. There was also a dairy near the caverns, but the Great Depression ended it. For quite a while the caverns were forgotten until they were eventually opened for a tourist spot. During the many centuries the cave has been around it has been filled with biological specimens and geological creations. Archeologists, biologists, and geologists have entered the caverns to examine the various specimens. Others who were in the cave prior to its being open to the public most likely took souvenirs. One dig resulted in an excavation of a tusk six feet long. It was circled around a rock. The tusk was from a Mammoth. The cave is even now home to various organisms like bats, beetles, crickets, and salamanders.

In 1836, Cathedral of San Fernando played a role in the battle of Alamo. A flag was hoisted from the church's tower, marking the beginning of the siege. Because of Cathedral's prominent role in history, Pope John Paul II made a visit to the cathedral in September 1987. Cathedral of San Fernando is the mother church of the Archdiocese of San Antonio and is the seat of the archbishop. Over the years, the church has endured slight renovations, enlarging the gothic style and adding stone carvings in 1800's.

"Cave without a Name","Texas","Cave without a Name, Boerne, TX","Eleven miles outside of Boerne, Texas is a national natural landmark visitors may wish to see. The Cave without a Name runs along FM 474 and has been a commercial location since 1939. The cave was created more than 10 thousand years ago. There is evidence of prehistoric animals and human contact with the cave from the early centuries. Archeologists have discovered 20th century remains from humans in the cave. It was a small animal farm at first for the humans. Traps were laid in the opening of the cave. After its initial use in the 19th century it was forgotten, until 1920. During the Prohibition era local residents decided to create a moonshine distillery in the uppermost area of the cavern. Once prohibition was over it was forgotten, until the owner decided to make it a commercial landmark. In the 30's the owner began advertising the cave. The owner, it is said, opened up a contest to name the cave. A boy suggested it was too beautiful to have a name, so as the winner he received $250 in cash and it was named the Cave without a Name. Inside the cave a stairwell was built to lead guests into the cave's belly. The stairwell has 126 steps and takes visitors 90 feet into the earth. The temperature inside is 66 degrees Fahrenheit all year. There are really only two areas the public is allowed to go;the main set of chambers and then the extension that leads to the underground section of the Guadalupe River. However, this extension is only open to those who have proper training in diving. In fact any scuba diver with a cave diving certification can come to the cave for a magical underwater experience. There are treacherous areas in the cave for those who dive. For example Dead Man's Cave was investigated for why rain water was not draining, and it ended in the death of the owner's son. This is why only experienced cave divers are welcome in the second area. As of 2006 the National Park Service declared the cave a National Natural Landmark. Tours of the cave will take 60 minutes. There are six rooms that are a part of the tour. Tours are set to depart throughout the day, about every hour. Children who are six or under can go free with a paid adult.

The cavern has been designated as a National Natural Landmark since 1966 and is one of the most active caves in the world with over 95% of its formations still growing. Openings were discovered by chance when a dog chased a raccoon into a 20 inch opening, prompting locals to begin exploring the cave in the early 1920s and head about 500 feet from the entrance to a fifty-foot deep pit. It wasn't until 1955 when cavers discovered bizarre formations, which encouraged development of the cavern in 1959 to preserve it for future generations, and a year later it was opened to the public for the first time. Guided walking tours are offered at the cavern, which has approximately 360 stair steps and can reach a temperature of 71 degrees, but with a 98 percent humidity level this feels more like 85 degrees.

"Cedars Neighborhood in Dallas","Texas","Cedars Neighborhood in Dallas","Cedars neighborhood is located south of downtown Dallas near Interstate 30. Cedars is a culturally rich neighborhood filled with nightlife, art, restaurants, schools, churches, and has a vast array of housing options. The neighborhood was developed in the late 1800's for middle-class residents of Dallas. The neighborhood originally featured Victorian styled homes and had a predominantly Jewish population. An Israelite synagogue in the neighborhood attracted the Jewish community of Dallas. Over the years, Cedars neighborhood begin to transform into an urban area. Cedars neighborhood has been a haven for creative professionals and artists for over 20 years. The neighborhood was pushed to the forefront of becoming a trendy entertainment district but is failing to develop due to the homeless epidemic that has plagued the area. There are several homeless shelters located in the Cedars neighborhood. In May 2008, Dallas opened a long-awaited homeless center in the Cedar neighborhood called The Bridge. The homeless center is open to the needy twenty-four hours a day. The $21 million center has taken steps to solve the problem of chronic homelessness by providing health care, haircuts, laundry services, and even pet care. The facility is over 75,000 square-feet and holds 175 cots. The homeless center in Cedar has been a positive force in the area since it opened in the spring of 2008. Cedars has its own neighborhood association which was founded in April, 2003. The mission of the Cedars Neighborhood Association is to improve the overall quality of life in Cedars by promoting cultural, economic, and aesthetic prosperity. The neighborhood has a goal of moving Cedars forward in a positive direction and over the years Cedars has been on the move. Cedars Neighborhood Association is not restricted to homeowners - members, business owners, developers, and anyone who frequents the neighborhood or has interest in the area is free to become a member. The Cedars Neighborhood Association has appeared in several Dallas news sources with their plans to force out industrial businesses that reduce the attractiveness of the neighborhood. In 2008, Cedar residents attempted to remove the rights to a 62 year old industrial company and prohibit them from operating in the neighborhood. Cedars is a unique and diverse neighborhood that was once considered a fashionable place to go but now struggles to maintain a trendy image. There are new nightspots and residential developments, but it still hasn't brought the type of vitality that is seen in neighborhoods like West Village or the The Bishops Art District.  City officials in Dallas continue to work on spurring growth in the Cedar neighborhood, but progress has been slow. City officials aren't the only ones concerned with boosting the economic revenue of Cedar - residents are also attempting to create bold ideas to propel the area forward with the rest of Dallas. One exciting event that residents promote every year to attract new businesses and residents to the area is the Cedar Open Studios.  Every year Cedar artists display their work to the public in an open environment that allows people a chance to learn about the neighborhood."

"Chinati Foundation","Texas","Chinati Foundation - Marfa, TX - a contemporary museum founded by Donald Judd","Donald Judd founded the Chinati Foundation (La Fundacion Chinati) which is a museum for contemporary art found in Marfa, Texas. The goal of the museum is to present large scale permanent exhibits to the public while permanently preserving the work of a select number of artists. The original concept of the museum has since expanded and turned into something much more amazing to fulfill his vision. The foundation is on three hundred and forty acres where the Fort D.A. Russell once stood in Marfa, Texas in addition to the abandoned military building there are also other buildings in the center of the town. There are over ten buildings that make up the museum and even though the founder died in 1994 the foundation still makes an attempt to keep the art displays permanent. In 1971 Donald Judd made his first visit to Marfa, Texas then moved there in 1977 from New York. During 1979 the construction of the museum began with the Dia Art Foundation out of New York assisting. In 1986 the Chinati Foundation was opened to the public as a publicly funded, non-profit organization. The original concept of the museum was to display the work of Dan Flavin, John Chamberlain and Donald Judd. The collection expanded to included Roni Horn, Carl Andre, Richard Long, Coosje van Bruggen, John Wesley and others over the years as the idea for the Chinati foundation was expanded. The grounds of the museum have separate buildings for the work of each artist. The goal the Judd held for the Chinati Foundation was to bring nature, architecture and art together as a whole. Cultural universities and institutions and the local community were linked with the educational and art programs sponsored by the Chinati Foundation. The Artists in Residence Program at Chinati Foundation gives artists from all over the world an opportunity to exhibit and develop their art. Students have the opportunity for a first hand museum experience with the Internship Program at Chinati. During the summer local students can attend art classes at the museum. Since 1995 there has been an annual newsletter published in both Spanish and English by the Chinati foundation. Guided tours are the only time the foundation is open to view the art. Wednesday through Sunday there are tours available to the public. Tours are divided into two parts with a break taken for lunch because of the amount of time it takes to complete the tours. Tours start at ten in the morning with a lunch break at noon. Tours then resume at two in the afternoon for completion. The Chinati foundation is approximately three hours from both the Midland/Odessa and El Paso airports. With the large scale exhibits and proximity to the area attractions in Marfa, Texas the Chinati Foundation is somewhere you should definitely add to the list of stops along the way if you're ever in the area. With all that the Chinati Foundation does for the community it is well worth visiting and taking a closer look into the programs that are offered."

"Comal River","Texas","Comal River, New Braunfels, TX","Texas is a large state, with plenty of rivers, lakes, and other water sources. Parts of Texas are set up on the Gulf of Mexico, and close enough to Mexico to provide great vacations for residents and travelers. For vacationers traveling to New Braunfels, Texas in the summer there is one attraction that can be quite fun. The Comal River is known as the longest shortest river in the world,'' at least to locals. In Texas everything is big, so it should not be a surprise that the river is considered large, even though it is actually a short river in comparison to other rivers in the state. Texas has the Guadalupe River and Colorado River, which are both very long. Comal River begins in Comal Springs, Comal County, Texas and ends at the mouth of the Guadalupe River in Comal County. The length of the river is 2.5 miles and its source elevation sits at 600 feet. During the year the river discharges about 312 feet per 9m/s. The basin area is 130 square miles. When the Spanish first inhabited the area they called Comal River the Guadalupe. However, Pedro de Rivera y Villalon discovered the longer Guadalupe in 1727 and thus the river was changed to Comal. Comal means basin or flat dish in Spanish. Comal River was used to power watermills and cotton gins by German settlers. It was then used to create hydroelectric power. Today Comal River is no longer used for industrial purposes, but as a recreation area for the locals. It was also used as part of the Schlitterbahn water park, but the original park was moved to another location in order to expand it. The Guadalupe Blanco River Authority maintains the river. One special aspect of the Comal River is the fountain darter. The fountain darter is a fish that is almost extinct. The Comal and San Marcos River are the only two in the world that have this species of fish. For recreational purposes the river is typically at 72 degrees Fahrenheit. There are tubers which have been left behind as the river was developed millions of years ago. The mild current combined with the clear water make swimming enjoyable for local residents. It is even a local scuba diving spot. The tubers and the depth of the river in some areas make it perfect for the sport. The river is warm even in winter, allowing divers to go year round. During the summer thousands of people will come to tube down the river or walk around the edges in the foliage. The river is lined with trees and bushes, making it a beautiful spot of a picnic and wilding viewing. Tubing on the Comal is more of a meandering ride, whereas other rivers like the Guadalupe can be dangerous due to the rapids and boulders. At the Comal River where a parking lot and visitor center has been built there is a tubing ramp and walkways to make it even more fun. Texas Tube has set up to rent tubes for visitors."

"Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas","Texas","Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas","The Cotton Bowl stadium was originally known as The House that Doak Built. The stadium received its name in honor of Ewell Doak Walker who was an American football player in the hall of fame. Doak was a multi-sport athlete who attended Southern Methodist University as a running back, place kicker, and defensive back. Doak was such a huge Dallas star that he was able to get incredibly large crowds to the Cotton Bowl stadium during his college career in the 1940's. The stadium was also known as Fair Park Bowl because of its location in Fair Park but the more well known name of the stadium is the Cotton Bowl, named for the Cotton Bowl Classic, a game that has been played annually since 1937. In January 2009, the legendary Cotton Bowl Classic was moved twenty miles west to a new Dallas Cowboy's stadium. The final Cotton Bowl Game was played at the stadium on January 2, 2009. The new stadium where the Cotton Bowl Classic will be played features luxury boxes, field-length video boards, and a retractable roof. Because of the deep history and connection that the Cotton Bowl Classic has with the stadium, thousands of native Texans are mourning the loss of the game that will no longer be played at the historic landmark. Although the Classic will no longer be played at the stadium, officials are exploring the possibility of replacing the Cotton Bowl Classic with another game. A possible new bowl tenant could be the Armed Forces Bowl which is owned and operated by ESPN. Stadium officials are in current negotiations with ESPN representatives. The Cotton Bowl stadium isn't just home to football. Over the years the stadium has been host to numerous events. The Cotton Bowl stadium has hosted concerts, international soccer games, and a musical event called the Parade of Bands. When Elvis Presley was only 21-years-old he played at the Cotton Bowl stadium in 1956. His concert attracted more than 27,000 people and goes down in history as the largest audience ever at a Texas outdoor concert. The legendary concert presented by Elvis is just one of the many historic moments that have been experienced in the Cotton Bowl Stadium. Cotton Bowl stadium has been home to two NFL franchises since it was first established. The Texans football team played there before becoming the Kansas City Chiefs. Texas then created the Dallas Cowboys who made the stadium home in 1960. The Dallas Cowboys lived at the stadium until 1971 and then moved on to another stadium. Today, Cotton Bowl stadium is a historic landmark. In 1994, the stadium underwent major renovations. Later, in 2008, millions of dollars was poured into the stadium for renovations and thousands of new seats were installed. With the additional seats the stadium can hold up to 68,300 attendees. It is a classic and traditional open air stadium with real grass that envelops the stadium in a perfect oval. The Cotton Bowl stadium is located east of downtown Dallas."

"Cowboys Stadium","Texas","Cowboys Stadium - Arlington, Texas - home field of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys","As of 2009, the new home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys football team is Cowboys Stadium. Located in Arlington, Texas, this stadium is a domed field that replaced the open-air Texas Stadium, which was home to the Cowboys since 1971. The roof on Cowboys Stadium will be retractable, so the team can play under the sky when the weather is agreeable, but fans don't have to suffer the elements when the weather is bad. Cowboys Stadium can accommodate up to 80,000 fans normally, but expandable sections make the total capacity 100,000. The construction cost an estimated $1.3 billion, and the building was designed by architectural company HKS. Originally, the stadium was only set to cost around $650 million, but the growing price tag has made it one of the most expensive projects in the history of sports. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has contributed much of the money, but the city of Arlington also voted to increase sales tax, car rental tax, and hotel occupancy tax to help pay for construction costs. In total, the city will contribute around $325 million. The NFL has also pledged to cover some of the costs, though there are rules about how much they can contribute to any one team for a stadium. Although they broke ground on the stadium in late 2005, no company had signed a naming rights contract as of mid-2009. Some Cowboys fans created a petition to name the stadium after Tom Landry, who coached the team from 1960 to 1988. Landry passed away in 2000 at the age of 75, and during his time as coach, he led the Cowboys to 20 consecutive winning seasons, a record that has gone unchallenged since he left Dallas. Many fans have been calling Cowboys Stadium Jerry World'' in reference to the team owner. Cowboys Stadium is recognizable by two large 300-foot arches, which fans can walk through at either end. Each end zone also has a large glass door, which can be opened when the weather is nice, and a large video display board will be hung from the center of the stadium. At the time of the building, this was the largest high-definition television screen in the world. The rest of the design is very similar to the much-loved Texas Stadium, which has a roof with a trademark hole. Jones first began talking about a new stadium for the Cowboys in 1994, and official talks with the city of Arlington began in 1997. This stadium is schedule not only to hold Dallas Cowboys games, but also to be the site of the 2009 and 2010 NCAA Big 12 Championship games, the NCAA Cotton Bowl, the 2014 NCAA Men's Final Four tournament, the 2010 NBA All-Star game, Super Bowl XLV, the 2009 Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Gold Cup, and a number of college football regular season games.

Pei, Norman Foster, and Rem Koolhaas have all contributed their designs to the area to give it a modern, classic, and creative ambiance. The city's most contemporary architecture can easily be found in the Dallas Arts District. The arts district has been developing into more of a cultural enclave in Dallas over the years with ongoing construction in the area to provide more landmarks and facilities. In 2008, the city of Dallas began to focus on completing construction in the area with a final institution called the City Performance Hall. Dallas hopes that it will be the final addition to the district in 2010. The Dallas Arts District began to pump financial liquidity into the city of Dallas during the 1980's and is maturing slowly over the years. The area is overflowing with institutions that seek to inform the Dallas public about cultural endeavors and promote the embrace of artistic education.

The Black Dance Theatre is one of many facilities in the Dallas Arts District that has a historical aspect; it is the oldest continuously operating dance company in Dallas. The dancers at the theatre company perform modern, jazz, spiritual, and ethnic pieces in their shows. Unfortunately, the downside to the area is that the Dallas Arts District only caters to those interested in art. Restaurants and shopping are not prominent fixtures in the area. The arts district only has a bustle of activity when events or shows are taking place. Numerous art organizations and locals would like to change that aspect of the district. The area is used as a place where artistic organizations promote their work and an influx of restaurants and shopping opportunities would help to bring more people to the area during seasons where events are not as frequent."

"Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport","Texas","Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport","Many people assume that Houston is the largest and busiest airport in Texas but the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is larger and busier. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is named for its location between Dallas and Fort Worth and is the third busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movement. The airport covers almost thirty square miles and consist of over 18,000 acres of land. In 2007, nearly sixty million people were transported by the airport which makes it the seventh busiest airport in the world. The large amount of aircraft traffic that originates at Dallas/Fort Worth International makes the airport a huge economic engine in North Texas. Every day, over 164,000 passengers pass through the terminals of the airport. It was 1927 when the city of Dallas approached Fort Worth with the idea of building an airport that both cities could use, however, city officials in Ft. Worth declined the offer. Fort Worth wanted to built its own municipal airport and did so on the city's north side. By 1965, both cities realized how economically efficient it would be if both cities shared the same airport. Dallas and Fort Worth came to an agreement on a new location for where the airport would be built. The airport would be on the county line which was an equal distance from the two city centers. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport officially started operating in 1974 and is one of the busiest airports in the world today. The airport contributes greatly to the economic prosperity of Dallas and Fort Worth. The airport employs over 300,000 people and has an annual payroll of 7.6 billion dollars. The economic output that is attributed to the Dallas/Ft. Worth area from the airport is 16.6 billion dollars. In order to make the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport a more efficient airport constant renovations are always in progress. Currently, a $45 million terminal renovation is expected to be completed in 2009. There are exactly five terminals located in the airport: terminals A, B, C, D, and E. Each terminal serves a different airline. The airport equips each terminal with multiple shops, restaurants, and services. There are over 100 specialty shops and retail stores where passengers can purchase books, gifts, clothing, and even electronics. The airport has over 120 food destinations and every imaginable palate is satisfied. Fast food, business casual restaurants, coffee houses, and cocktail lounges can all be found in the airport. There are other services available at the airport as well such as shoe shines, massages, wireless internet access, and play areas for children. There are a total of 20 airlines that contribute to the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Thirteen of the airlines are domestic and seven are international. The airport can accommodate travel to over 173 destinations. The airport's centralized location in the United States also makes it a popular spot for layovers and connection flights. Air Cargo transportation is another major source of revenue for the airpot. Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport handles more than half of the air cargo in Texas and was ranked as the best cargo airport in the world in an Air Cargo World survey."
"Davis Mountains State Park","Texas","Davis Mountains State Park - Fort Davis, Texas - Outdoor Recreation in West Texas","Approximately four miles northwest of Fort Davis in West Texas, Davis Mountains State Park occupies just over 2,700 acres in Jeff Davis County, midway between Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Carlsbad Caverns, and Big Bend National Park. The area was deeded to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department by a local family during the Great Depression and improvements were made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1933. Since the late 1930s, the park has been open to the public. Formal campground facilities were added in 1967. As the most extensive mountain range in Texas, the Davis Mountains were formed by volcanic activity some 65 million years ago. The range was named after Jefferson Davis, who served as the U.S. Secretary of War and was later President of the Confederacy. He was also responsible for ordering the construction of the Fort Davis army post, which was active from 1854 until 1891. In 1961, its ruins were declared a National Historic Site, and the National Park Service undertook a major preservation program to restore the structure. Today, visitors can enjoy camping, sightseeing, nature study, star-gazing and picnicking in the Davis Mountains State Park. Other popular recreational activities are hiking, backpacking, day and overnight equestrian use, and mountain biking. The park features several picturesque drives and two scenic overlooks, with four miles of hiking trails that connect with the Fort Davis National Historic Site. South of State Highway 118, there are restrooms with and without showers. Other facilities in the south half of the park include campsites with water and electricity, sewer service, and cable TV connections. There is a group picnic area with tables, an outdoor amphitheater with a capacity of 200, a playground, an interpretive center staffed by volunteers, and a Texas State Park Store. For hiking, nine miles of marked trails have been developed. North of State Highway 118, the Limpia Canyon Primitive Area takes up the northern half of the park. It has been designated as a special use area with a fee required. It includes ten miles of rough hiking trails as well as primitive tent campsites and equestrian campsites.

"Deep Eddy Pool in Austin","Texas","Deep Eddy Pool in Austin","The Deep Eddy Pool in Austin is the oldest swimming pool in Texas. The pool started as a swimming hole in the Colorado River before forming into an eddy.  In 1915, A.J. Eilers, Sr purchased the land surrounding the swimming hold and constructed a concrete pool. In 1935, the City of Austin bought the property and transformed the area and eddy into the city's main swimming pool. The pool has been used as the centerpiece for a variety of projects over the decade and is registered as a historic landmark. Deep Eddy Pool has even been the inspiration for various works of art, including the famous song Deep Eddy Blues written by Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The Deep Eddy Pool is located next to Elders Park, right off the hike and bike trails, and steps from the Mopac Bridge. The area is located west of downtown Austin and has a convenient location for quick morning swims.  The pool is man-made yet is fed by a spring. Because the pool water comes from a spring, temperatures in the eddy are consistently very cool. Water in the Deep Eddy pool remains between 72 and 75 degrees during the summer. Although the water stays relatively cool, the pool is reviewed by swimmers as surprisingly refreshing. The pool is surrounded by an expansive grassy area that provides swimmers with enough area to spread out towels and dry off. The water in the Deep Eddy Pool is chlorine-free and has been a popular attraction for locals and tourists since the 1920's depression era. Deep Eddy is the main city pool in Austin and has remained that way for decades. It is also a longtime favorite of locals for sunbathing. One of the most popular events at the Deep Eddy Pool are the Splash Party Movie Nights. The event is a family oriented program that occurs during the summer. At the event, visitors can float in the pool, enjoy refreshments, picnic on the lawn, or watch a feature film once the sun goes down. Families with young children will be delighted to discover that Deep Eddy Pool is very child-friendly. All ages are welcome to the pool and a large shallow area is available of smaller children. Food is not allowed around the pool, but is allowed in the picnic area near the entrance where tables are provided. Visitors to the pool attend for recreation as well as exercise. There are lap lanes as well as free open swimming spaces. The pool is divided into two sections: the west side of the pool contains a shallow area and a place for recreation and the east side of the pool has lanes and laps for avid swimmers. The Deep Eddy Pool is almost as popular as the famous Barton Springs in Austin. Both are heavily frequented by locals and remain crowded year round. There is an admission fee to spend a day at the Deep Eddy Pool, adults are charged $3 and children are charged $1. Local Austin residents are so fond of the city pool that the Friends of Deep Eddy was created to keep the eddy safe and clean. Friends of Deep Eddy is a non-profit organization composed of individuals devoted to protecting and improving the artesian well."

"Dinosaur Valley State Park","Texas","Dinosaur Valley State Park, Glen Rose, TX","Northwest of Glen Rose, Texas in Somervell County is Dinosaur Valley State Park. The park sits on 1524 acres of land running along the Paluxy River. In 1968 the State Parks Bonds Program acquired the land from private owners. It took some time, but in 1972 the park was finally open to the public. The Paluxy River was carved over 113 million years ago when an ancient sea ran along the limestone, mudstone, and sandstone. The water eventually dissipated leaving just the river water. The water in the river has worked about a million years to carve out what visitors can see today. Some of the more resistant beds in the river have been cut down and several rocks are exposed in other spots as the river water carved around them to keep moving. The name for the Valley Park came from the leftover prints of Dinosaurs. The state park has some of the better preserved dinosaur tracks to be found in the United States and around the World. Some of the tracks are down at the river, so they can be hidden when the river is flowing higher. Droughts in the last few years in Texas have made it possible to visit the state park and see the prints easier. To show visitors what they may see two fiberglass models have been created. One is of a 70- foot Apatosaurus and the other is a 45 foot Tyrannosaurus Rex. The models were built due to a request of Sinclair Oil Company. They wanted to take the models to the New York World's Fair Dinosaur Exhibit, where they stayed from 1964 to 1965. The park provides more than just dinosaur footprints. It is possible to camp, hike, picnic, and mountain bike throughout the park. There is a separate 100 acres for equestrian use. For those who feel they are strong enough they can swim in the river. However, the river does not have a lifeguard, so it is swim at your own risk. Fishing and wildlife observation are two other options at Dinosaur Valley State Park.

"East Texas Oil Museum","Texas","East Texas Oil Museum - Kilgore, Texas - Oil Town Museum","East Texas Oil Museum is located on the campus of Kilgore College on Highway 259 at Ross Street in Kilgore, Texas and is approximately 25 minutes drive from East Texas Regional Airport in Longview. It is essentially a museum recreating a 1930's thriving oil town emphasized by the use of dioramas, films, photos and other artifacts. The museum is open from 9am to 4pm Tuesday to Saturday and 2pm to 5pm on Sundays, but remains closed on Mondays as well as at Easter and Thanksgiving, whilst between April and September the attraction closes at 5pm. The museum shows how oil was discovered in East Texas in 1930 by Columbus Marion Joiner on the Daisy Bradford farm in Rusk County. When the Bateman Oil Company found another huge supply at the Crim family farm just nine miles from the Daisy Bradford farm it eventually became apparent that there was a huge geological phenomenon in the area. This was to become the East Texas Oil field with production rapidly increasing from seven wells every other week, to seven wells daily, to more than 100 wells put into production each day. Production reached as high as one million barrels per day in 1931, and the wells at the oil field are still pumping. The East Texas Oil Field has produced over 4.5 billion barrels of oil, some of which helped the allies during World War II by providing them with the petroleum-reserve stability needed to defeat the enemy. The museum shows how the discovery of oil in the area also brought about the creation of new towns, as well as jobs for thousands of East Texas citizens after a period of deep economic depression in the country. The whole experience provided at the East Texas Oil Museum is a history lesson on how people lived, worked and entertained themselves in the area back in the 1930s. One of the major exhibits here is the full scale Boomtown, which contains stores, dummies dressed in the attire of the day, animals and machinery, which serves to recreate how the town functioned with its new found wealth following the discovery of oil. Visitors can also learn more about the local schools and transportation from this era. Along the old rutted street, there are old style stores stocked with memorabilia and where refreshments can be taken at the drugstore. Music also forms part of the experience with 1930s big band music being played on the jukebox, whilst children can get their picture taken with a wildcatter. Recreated here are also a newspaper office, barbershop and of course a gas station. The movie theater shows historical footage of the boom period and how oil was discovered, and there is film footage on drilling an oil well. Geographical exhibits and an elevator ride to the center of the earth are also an interesting part of the tour, where guides explain more about the oil deposits 3,800 feet below the earth's surface.

"Enchanted Rock State Park","Texas","Enchanted Rock State Park, Fredericksburg, Texas","Located at 16710 Ranch Road is one of Fredericksburg, Texas's attractions called Enchanted Rock State Park. The park has 1643 acres of land running along Big Sandy Creek in the northern section of town. It borders Gillespie and Llano Counties. The deed to create it as a natural park came in 1978 by the Nature Conservancy of Texas Inc., when they received the land from the Moss Family. Eventually the state took over the running of the park in 1984. They closed the park for a few months in order to add facilities. The history of the land predates the park by 11,000 years. Humans used the land, most likely early Native Americans as a place to live, find food, and just survive. In 1970 the Enchanted Rock that is on the land was dedicated as a National Natural Landmark and adopted in the National Register in 1984. The rock is pink granite that creates a dome rising over 425 feet, placing it at 1825 feet above sea level and over 640 acres large. It is considered batholiths because it was an underground rock formation that eventually became uncovered by erosion. The Tonkawa Indians believed that ghost fires would flicker on top of the rocks because they heard creaking and groaning noises. Geologists, however, consider this to be the noises of the rock cooling and contracting after a hot day in the sun. Park popularity typically means the parking capacity is reached frequently on the weekends. A lot of the time the park has to close around 11am and reopen at 5pm due to the over population of the park. It is best to call ahead before visiting the landmark to ensure the park is actually open. As a natural reserve there are plenty of activities for the visitors to Enchanted Rock. Backpacking, camping, hiking, rock climbing, and bird watching are just a few options. There are also areas for picnics, geological studies, and star gazing. There is a minimal amount of pollution in the air from the surrounding town, but this does not usually affect the star gazing options. Visitors are asked not to disturb the wildlife or plant life that is within the park. The geological features, Indian and historical artifacts should also remain undisturbed. The park is under state law, meaning visitors can be prosecuted for damaging the land and anything found on or in the land. The facilities built at the park include restrooms with showers, walk in water sites, tent pads, picnic tables, fire rings, and hiking trails to various sites. There are grills at the camping areas for use during the day. One short steep trail leads to the top of the Enchanted Rock, but foot traffic is only allowed. It is harder for wheelchairs to get to the top based on the trail. There is an interpretive center on site and a Texas State Park Store for souvenirs. Camping is by tent only as there are no facilities for RV's. Entrance fees are $6 per day."

"First Monday Trade Days","Texas","First Monday Trade Days - Canton, TX - A large flea market in Canton, Texas","Canton, Texas holds a flea market each month known as the First Monday Trade Days every Thursday through Sunday before the first Monday of every month. The event which claims to be the oldest and largest continual flea market in the U.S. is very popular. There can be as many as one hundred thousand shoppers at First Monday Trade Days dependant on the time of year. Sometime during the 1850's is when the trade days began, then a circuit judge would stop in areas on set days to have court sessions. These were the days that people went into town to conduct their business and attend the court proceedings, the day Canton did this was on the first Monday of the month. This tradition is where the name comes from. Farmers caught wild or stray horses and took them to the trade days for auction which led to these days being referred to as Horse Monday at times. Then people started to bring their own horse to trade or sell and eventually people began to bring their excess produce. Over the years the trade days grew and became the flea market that is known as the First Monday Trade Days today. The flea market now covers more than one-hundred acres and has enough placements for six thousand vendors. There are several areas and buildings with designated names at the event including the Mountain, the Village, Old Mill Marketplace, Dog Alley and The Arbors. The Lewis side which the city operates is next to the facility that holds the First Monday Trade Days. The regular, more established vendors reserve space in the buildings all year.

"Flatiron Building","Texas","Flatiron Building - Fort Worth, TX - Seven-Story Wedge Building","In 1883, Marshall R. Sanguinet moved to Fort Worth. He formed an architectural company, Sanguinet and Staats, with Carl G. Staats in 1903. This company then proceeded to build many of the buildings in the Fort Worth area including churches, schools, the Waggoner Building, and the Flatiron Building. The Flatiron Building in Fort Worth was commissioned by Dr. Bacon Saunders, who had seen the 22-story NYC Flatiron Building. Saunders, a prominent surgeon, had moved to Fort Worth in 1893 and desired to establish his medical practice atop a building like the one he had seen in Manhattan. The Fort Worth Flatiron Building was completed in 1907. The Flatiron Building is located at 1000 Houston Street, on the corner of Houston Street and West 9th Street. This location is at the northwest corner of the Fort Worth Convention Center and just north of Fort Worth City Hall. It is roughly 2,750 square feet. At the time that it was built, the Flatiron Building was one of Fort Worth's first buildings to have a steel frame. It was also the tallest building in north Texas at the time that it was built. The design of the Fort Worth Flatiron Building was heavily influenced by what is known as the Chicago School of Architecture. This style was developed by a number of architects active in Chicago during the 1880s through the early 1900s. It is notable for its steel-frame structure and fire-resistant materials. Architectural enthusiasts will be able to note the influences of the famous Chicago School architect, Louis Sullivan. The original plans were for the building to be ten stories, but due to cost, this was reduced to the current seven stories. Saunders had commissioned the building for $70,000. Sullivan's concept of dividing a building into three parts, the base, shaft, and crown can be seen in the Flatiron Building's construction. The Flatiron Building has a two-story base and five-story shaft. Dr. Saunders' office and pharmacy were located on the top two floors. The exterior fazade of what was Saunders' offices is highlighted by numerous arches. Above the second floor exterior, a number of panther heads stand out from the fazade. This symbolism harkens back to Robert Cowart's 1875 comment about Fort Worth, which lead to the Fort Worth being nicknamed Panther City.'' The rather ornate cornice styling is often considered architecturally Neo-romantic. In 1969, the building was listed as a state historical item and two years later was included on the National Register of Historical Places. When built it was the tallest building in North Texas. The building remains the only flatiron-styled building in Texas, and is one of five on the National Register. Although the building can still be seen by visitors, the Flatiron Building is currently undergoing renovations that are anticipated to cost $4 million. The renovations call for a cafy to be added on the ground floor of the building. In addition, the renovations intend to convert part of the building into luxury loft apartments."

"Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge","Texas","Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge - Fort Worth, TX - Preservation and Protection","The Forth Worth Nature Center and Refuge is located in Fort Worth, Texas. It is located at 9601 Fossil Ridge Road in Fort Worth, TX. Fort Worth is located in the north of Texas and is the seventeenth largest city in the USA. The center is located in the northern part of Fort Worth, off of Jacksonboro Highway, near Lake Worth. Lake Worth is a reservoir that was built in 1914. The mission statement of the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge states their desire to educate the community in the protection and preservation of natural areas, particularly those in North Central Texas.  The Refuge is over 3,600 acres in size and stretches between the Fort Worth (Grand) Prairie and the Western Cross Timbers. These two ecosystems form the emphasis of the Center's focus. The land itself is a combination of prairie and savannah. The West Fork of the Trinity River cuts through the Refuge. The West Fork is one of four forks of the Trinity River. The West Fork flows through the city of Fort Worth as well as Lake Worth. Savannahs, which have sparse tree cover, and prairies, which have no tree cover, make up the Refuge property. As such, the grassland ecosystem encompassed by the Refuge includes a variety of ecologically important grasses. These include: little bluestem (a perennial grass which is blue in the spring), Indian grass (the official state grass of SC and OK), and dropseed (which flowers in late summer). Post oak trees, which are native to Texas, is the most common tree on the Refuge. There are some samples which are over 300 years old on the property. Bur oaks, large trees which grow in the open, are also common to the area. There are paved roads which lead to over 20 miles of hiking trails. Most of the trails are between 2 and 3.5 miles in length. Prairie Trail is a 1.13 mile trail in open prairie that is connected to Oak Motte and Wild Plum Trails. Wild Plum is a shorter trail, about a half-mile, that wends its way through wild plum thickets. Oak Motte is over 2 miles long and meanders through clusters of oak trees. Along these trails, wildlife is prevalent. Bald eagles, turkeys, black vultures, and osprey are all common sites along the water. White-tailed deer and prairie dogs are also commonly spotted. The Nature Center and Refuge has a vast array of programs and features throughout the year. A detailed calendar of events is available on their website. Some events and programs include: Naturalist-led Nature Walks, Canoe Tours, and photography workshops. There are frequent workshops that involve visitors in projects, such as the building Kitchen Worm Bins or Bird Feeders. Seasonal-themed events also take place.

Then tragedy struck and it was closed to the public after four people died there on June 16, 2004. Three children and one adult drowned after one of the children fell in the pool. It is mistakenly believed that the child jumped in to swim. The other three jumped in trying to save the child. At the time, the water was unusually deep due to a pump malfunction and heavy rains. The park was reopened in March 4, 2007, only after being made much safer by reducing the depth of the main pool from 9feet deep to 2feet deep. This beautiful and refreshing oasis has been in the movies, the film Logan's Run was filmed in the active pool at the Water Gardens in 1976.

The railroad had two locomotives to help move the train. The first was Puffy, an 1896 steam locomotive. It is the oldest steam engine still operating. The second is a 1953 GP-7 diesel engine. For visitors the train engines pull 1920's and 1930's era Victorian coaches. It is possible to take a step back in time on these train cars to the days when train travel was used to move towards the west and progress. The schedule will vary throughout the year. In summer months the trains run more often for the influx of visitors Texas will see. In winter the trains run Friday through Sunday. The train departs at 1pm to head to the Stockyards arriving at 2:30pm. The train will then depart the Stockyards at 4:45pm and arrive back at Grapevine by 6:15pm. Adult passengers are $20, seniors $18, and Children 3 to 12 are $10. There is also the Trinity River Run that departs the Stockyards at 3:15pm and arrives back at 4:15pm. It is a round trip run. Tickets for this train are $10 for adults, $9 for seniors and $6 for children 3 to 12. On the Grapevine trip it is possible to purchase a one way ticket. The Historic Grapevine Railroad works with a few hotels in Fort Worth and Grapevine for package deals. The railroad also has annual events that they host. For example in winter there is the North Pole Express. There is also a New Vintage Jazz Wine Train, Sweetheart Express for Valentine's Day, Spring Fling for a day out with Thomas the Train, and much more. For every holiday there is usually a train special like on Mother's Day. In summer, The Great Train Robberies will begin with a dinner theater style show. Groups, birthday parties, field trips, cab rides, charters, and caboose parties can be planned. These gatherings do require reservations. It is necessary to book months in advance to ensure no other bookings or tickets have been sold. The parties can be localized to one train car.

"Highland Park Village in Dallas","Texas","Highland Park Village in Dallas","The Highland Park Village in Dallas is recognized as an area that made national history. The Highland Park Village is the United States' first shopping center and the prototype for shopping centers around the nation. Highland Park Village was opened in 1931 and has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. When the Village first opened its doors to the public in 1931, it was a cluster of booths and games with a large Ferris wheel being the focal point. Contestants at the games could win a grand prize of a pony. Highland Park Village followed that tradition and raffled a pony off for many years. The masterminds of Highland Park are Hugh Prather and Edgar Fillpen who eventually hired Wilbur David Cook to help plan the community. The area of Highland Park was designed by the Beverly Hill's architect, Wilbur David Cook. The noted architect took Highland Park and created an area that rivaled Beverly Hills in its beauty. It is still considered by many as one of the most beautiful communities in the United States. The two creators of Highland Park (Hugh Prather and Edgar Fillipen) wanted to create a a shopping center that would double as a town square. The architecture of Highland Park was inspired by Barcelona and Seville, Spain. Elements of Spanish and California culture and architecture went into the construction of Highland Park Village. The park has mediterranean flair that includes arched windows and doors, red tile roofs, brick walkways and beautiful landscaping. Highland Park Village sits on approximately 9.9 acres and has retail square footage measuring 200,000 square feet. The property is managed by Henry S. Miller Interests, Inc. With all of its space, Highland Park Village has dozens of shops that cater to a wide range of needs. Clothing, books, leather goods, eyewear, and fragrances are all for sale in the village.  Many of the shops and boutiques are more upscale than what a customer might find in a regular shopping mall. Chanel, Hermes, Jimmy Choo, and Tory Burch offer high-end designer items to the upper-class locals that surround Highland Park Village. There are three main restaurants located in the shopping square; Cafe Pacific, Patrizios, and Who's Who Burgers. The restaurants give visitors three core choices of either seafood, pizza and pasta, or cheeseburgers. Smaller food and beverage stands can be found throughout the village as well. The village is also home to many fundraisers and annual celebrations. The village hosted a children's annual fundraiser in 2007 and has a Christmas tree lighting ceremony every year. During the holiday season visitors to the shopping center can enjoy a trip in a horse-drawn carriage. Horse-drawn carriage rides are available through the entire month of December and originate at the Highland Park Village. The carriage ride takes tourists around to see all of the holiday lights. One of the main attractions of Highland Park Village is the Regent Highland Park Village Cinema. The theatre has old-world charm with modern big-screen releases. Visitors to the theatre love the Cinema for its antique ambiance and reasonable prices."

"Historic District of Gruene","Texas","Historic District of Gruene - Gruene, Texas - an historic town in Texas","Comal County, Texas has a ghost town that was originally known as Goodwin, the town is now Gruene, Texas. Situated on the Guadalupe River it was once a community that produced significant amounts of cotton. Today it is a tourist attraction due to the refusal to change with the times. The city of Gruene is completely within the New Braunfels city limits with much of Gruene having been placed on the National Register of Historic Places during April of 1975. The placement on the register means that the town gets to keep the authenticity of the 1800's. In 1872 a German farmer named Heinrich D. Gruene bought six thousand acres of farmland located on the Guadalupe River three miles to the north of New Braunfels. Gruene built a house and planted cotton on the remaining land. There were a number of sharecropping families on the land so he opened a mercantile during 1878 to serve them. The store did well for a number of years due to the location between San Antonio and Austin, Texas. The success of the store boosted the growth of the community and Thorn Hill School was built in 1878. Soon after the cotton gins were built increasing the commercial and farming activity a great deal by the time Comal County got the International Great Northern Railroad. This is when the town became Gruene after its founder. There was never a post office in Gruene even though by the 1910's it had two freight rails stations. Boll Weevils, the Great Depression and the fact that highways bypassed the town after the 2nd World War all lead to the town of Gruene becoming a virtual Ghost Town by 1950. Reconstruction efforts for areas such as the mercantile and Gruene Hall began during the early portion of the 1970's. This reconstruction has continued through the present day even though New Braunfels has absorbed the town, Gruene is still a tourist business. Original structures such as the home Gruene built that is now the Gruene Mansion Inn. Gruene's goal when he built his home was to make people feel welcome. There are a number of rooms that are suitable for families in the Inn. There are now thirty self contained units that were created out of the carriage house, old barns, corn crib, the mansion and other buildings. Guests of the inn have their own private entrances, porches and bathrooms. The Gruene Mansion Inn in Gruene, Texas has a meeting room and break services. Guests are also provided with high speed access to the Internet and meals. There are thirty-one rooms total in the inn that is just a short distance from the Gruene Hall. There are five restaurants a short walk from the Inn. There is an historic water tower over the Gruene Hall in addition to other buildings that have been turned into restaurants and shops.

"Japanese Tea Gardens in San Antonio","Texas","Japanese Tea Gardens in San Antonio","The Japanese Tea Gardens provides one of the most tranquil and serene attractions in San Antonio, Texas. The garden was originally part of the historic Brackenridge Park that dated back to the 1800's. The idea for a Japanese Garden was conceived by Ray Lambert, a San Antonio City Parks Commissioner. Ray Lambert came up with the idea for a lily pond and eventually the small plot of water became the Japanese Tea Garden. To construct the garden, prison labor was used to shape a quarry and complex, full of stone arch bridges and walking paths. Initially, the Japanese Tea Garden was called The Lily Pond, but by 1915, the city requested that an immigrant from Japan transform the quarry into a Japanese-styled garden. Local San Antonio residents frequent the Japanese Tea Gardens as a place to reflect and meditate. The peaceful and spectacular views of ponds and exotic plants create a perfect environment for a simple stroll. Over time, the garden has received consistent high marks from reviewers who fully appreciate all the beauty that the Japanese Tea Gardens has to offer. The Japanese Tea Gardens are considered San Antonio's best kept secret. A Japanese Pogado that was constructed in the 1920's adds to the cultural element of the garden. Visitors to the garden can learn about its history through numerous plaques that are strategically placed throughout the tea garden. One of the plaques recalls the story of the Japanese family who originally lived in and owned the garden. The original owner, Mr. Kimi Eizo Jingu was eventually displaced during World War II due to prejudice and fear of Japanese citizens. The Jingu family was eventually reunited with the Japanese Tea Gardens but different plaques on bridges near the banks of ponds and entrance all depict the stained history that removed the Japanese family from the gardens they designed. As the years progressed, the Japanese Tea Gardens received less attention from the city and landscapers causing it to deteriorate. The infrastructure was left in disrepair and many of the plants and quarry had dried. The garden underwent renovations and was reopened in March 2008. The garden was closed to complete infrastructure rehabilitations to the facilities. The restored garden features shaded walkways, stone bridges, beautiful flora displays and a 60-foot waterfall. Numerous ponds filled with Koi surround the garden. The garden has returned to its original state as it was first conceived. It is now full of sparkling water and turtles swimming. The total cost to restore the garden cost over $1.5 million and was funded by public and private sources. The gardens are open from 6AM - 11PM and visitors are not charged an admission fee to enter. Visitors are attracted to the Japanese Tea Gardens for the free admission as well as the ability to freely take pictures of the quarry and plants. There are numerous other attractions that surround the Japanese Tea Gardens . The Witte Museum, Brakenridge Park, and the San Antonio Zoo are all within close proximity to the gardens. The garden's location give visitors the chance to attend various attractions within a short period of time. Adjacent to the Japanese Tea Gardens sits the Sunken Garden Theatre. The theatre is used for a large range of concerts and performances. The Japanese Tea Gardens was also designated as a Texas Civil Engineering Landmark. Its history and significance in San Antonio has earned it a spot on the National Register of Historic Places."

The city of Clear Lake is a middle to upper-middle class suburb of Houston that is situated about 25 miles south of downtown Houston. The center has a convenient location that is situated around several other suburbs and is accessible to a large demographic of people.

The Space Center theatre is designed for children who have a dream of being an astronaut when they grow up. Children and adults interested in working with or for Nasa are encouraged to visit Space Center Houston to have a comprehensive look of what it takes to be an astronaut or work in the center.

"JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston","Texas","JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston","The JPMorgan Chase Tower in Houston is comparable to the Sears Towers in its height and achievement of being one of the tallest buildings in the world. The towering skyscraper is located at 600 Travis street and was built in 1981. JPMorgan Chase Tower was originally named the Texas Commerce Tower. The building is an overwhelming tower of gray stainless steel and glass. Most skyscrapers have four sides but the JPMorgan Chase Tower has five sides which makes it unique and brands it as the tallest five-sided building in the world. The building is also connected to the city's downtown tunnel system. The tunnel system consist of subterranean pedestrian walkways that link twenty-five blocks together. The building was designed by architect Leoh Ming Pei, a Chinese-American architect who is considered the guru of modernist building designs. Leoh Ming Pei, also known as I. M. Pei, is famous for building the Bank of China Tower located in Hong Kong and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. The Chase tower was not built alone by I. M. Pei. The architect had help from 3D International with the construction and design. Although the architects of the tower were particularly careful to ensure the tower would be one of the tallest in the world and unique, the engineering of the elevator system was also well-planned as well. The elevators run incredibly quickly and it only takes visitors 60 seconds to go from floor one to sixty. The structural stability of the JPMorgan Chase Tower was greatly tested in the summer of 2008 when Hurricane Ike destroyed glass panels on the lower half of the building. As of 2009 the building is still undergoing repairs. The JPMorgan Chase Tower has a host of amenities such as restaurants, side walk cafes, and of course the banking center. The main restaurant in the tower is Ninfa's Cantina which specializes in Mexican dishes like fajitas, tacos, and enchiladas. The Alonti Cafe is also located in the building and is used as a catering service to the different corporations who lease space in the JPMorgan Chase Tower. There are two sidewalk cafes at the tower; Starbucks and Sweet Retreat. Because of its historic height tourists frequent the building to get a view of Houston from the observation deck which is located on the 60th floor. Visitors are offered a panoramic view of the Houston skyline from the observation deck. Visitors are able to see as far as twenty miles on a clear day from the deck. The observation deck also serves as a transfer point to those who desire to reach floors 49-75. The observation deck (also called the sky box) holds paintings from the famous Joan Miro, a Spanish painter and sculptor from Spain whose painting represented Surrealism. There is also a 55-foot sculpture by the artist overlooking the plaza of the JPMorgan Chase Tower. The statue is brightly colored, abstract and whimsical. Joan Miro's presence in the observation deck and at the front of the tower gives the JPMorgan Chase Tower a touch of culture and elegance."

"King Ranch, the largest ranch in the United States","Texas","King Ranch, the largest ranch in the United States","King ranch is located in Kingsville, in the south of Texas. The range is the largest in the Unites state at over 1,000,000 acres. The ranch was founded in 1853 by Captain Richard King and Gideon K. Lewis. The land consists of four large divisions with only two of the four bordering each other. In 1961 the ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark. A King Ranch museum is also operated by the King Ranch Company which is located at 405 North 6th Street, Kingsville. Richard King saw the land for the first time in 1852. He was so impressed with the land that he made an agreement with Texas Ranger Caption Gideon K. Legs'' Lewis to make the land into their ranch. The ranch started at 15,500 acres of land. Over the next two years King and Lewis sold half interest in the land and then started to acquire more land over time, the total area of the land in now 1.2 million acres. The first official brands on the ranch were cattle, these were recorded in 1859. The brand, `Running W', is still used to this day. The ranch started grazing, cattle, sheep, goat and horses then by the mid1870's the hallmark stock became, Brahman Bulls, Beef Shorthorns, Texas Longhorn and Herefords. In the 19th century the ranch was visited by many weary wayfarers, these wayfarers found that the ranch was well run operation but it also had an oasis of gentility at the ranch along with good warm hospitality provided by Kings new wife, Henrietta. While King was away on business, Henrietta guided the daily activities on the ranch. The King Ranch Corporation is involved in many other aspects of business. This includes having many holdings in other state and countries with agricultural, truck farming and citrus interests. The ranch not only raises cattle. They also raise quarter horses, cutting horses and thoroughbreds. The winner of the 1950 Kentucky Derby, Middle ground was raised at the range. The ranch has an unusual animal on the premises. This animal is the Nilgai which was imported from India. The Nilgai are born as twins ended up competing with the cows on the ranch; hunters were then invited in to hunt the animals. The hunting of the Nilgai no longer occurs, but the hunting has caused the Nilgai to become weary of humans and bolt like horses. Collections within the King Ranch museum include a photo essay completed by Toni Frissell that tells the story of the ranch in the early 1940's, saddles from around the world, a King Ranch commemorative Colt Python .357 magnum revolver, replicas of Texas flags, vintage cars and a custom designed Buick Eight hunting car. Besides the first artesian well that was drilled in the summer of 1899 is a permanent sculpture of Mrs. Henrietta King and her son in law Robert J. Kleberg Sr. There are also videos of the history of the ranch and the main house at the museum. The ranch is no longer managed by any of the King family. Many of the Mexican families who still work on the ranch feel that the relationship that with the current ranch management is no longer what is was when the King family was running the ranch."

Unlike recent developments and planned communities that have popped up around Dallas over the last decade, Lakewood has long-established community ties.

"Mandalay Canal","Texas","Mandalay Canal, Irving, TX","Mandalay Canal is known as the best kept secret of Irving, Texas. Many vacationers are unaware of the slice of Europe that can be found along Mandalay Canal in Texas. Many find that Irving's Mandalay Canal is reminiscent of Italy. Irving is a planned community with business developments. There are many steel office buildings, restaurants, and an Omni Hotel in the area. Las Colinas or the Colonies is next to Irving, and it is hard to tell where one city ends and the other begins. Las Colinas is filled with condos and apartment communities. What draws vacationers to this spot is learning about Mandalay Canal. Mandalay Canal is actually manmade. It was formed to connect to the manmade lake that many homes and businesses sit around. It is the canal that brings the air of Italy with it. The canal was created with cobblestones. It is treed lined and has many European emporium shops. The European Market appearance and feel is comfortable and enjoyable for the guests to the area. Some of the original shops are no longer open on Mandalay Canal. Instead they have been turned into more modern locations that are no longer retail shops. The water taxi service is no longer running, but a light rail service is now there. Much of Mandalay Canal has lost its original luster, but it is still a place for visitors. The evolution of the area has made it more futuristic than renaissance Italy in the last year or two. The location of Mandalay Canal is near Dallas/ Fort Worth. One must drive along LBJ or 635 Freeway to the Valley View exit east of the major city airport. It is easy to find once vacationers learn of it. The canal has street and garage parking spots. The weekends will find the canal mostly closed, since non retail businesses are lining the streets. To really see what the place has to offer guests should be out and about on the weekdays. Many of the restaurants and other areas will be filled with people. Around the actual Canal and buildings are new places. In fact Irving is filled with skyscrapers that make it look more futuristic. The office buildings tend to gleam in the sun during the day. The buildings house businesses like Exxon, GTE, Quaker State, Caltex, Sprint, and TransAmerica. Around these buildings are now 70,000 houses for the residents working in the corporations. While in the areas visitors should take advantage of the free options. For example there is the Pioneer Plaza Cattle Drive, Outdoor Sculpture Tour, Art Garden, Mustangs Sculpture, Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center, Spanish Art at the Meadows Museum, and Arts District Stroll. Along Mandalay Canal is a running and walking path. It is lined with trees and one of the more picturesque ways to see the canal. Another place to visit is the Farmers Branch Historical Park for a walk and picnic near Mandalay Bay.

"Market Square Historic District in Houston","Texas","Market Square Historic District in Houston","Two brothers, Augustus and John Allen arrived from New York to Galveston in 1831. Five years later the brothers saw the great potential of the bayou and land located North of Galveston. The two brothers invested heavily into the area eventually naming the place Houston. The Market Square Historic District is considered the spot where the Allen Brothers founded Houston. Within several years of establishing the Market Square, the city of Houston begin to climb to national prominence. The Market Square Historic District in Houston sits between four streets and is the home of nightclubs, restaurants, historical buildings, bars, and much more. The Market Square Historic District has over 150 years of history that is foretold through the unique architecture, old benches, and artifacts that have weathered the years. The Market Square was the original Houston business district but over time the district transformed into an historical area where interesting architecture can be viewed. The Market Square derived its name from its roots as an open air produce market in the year 1854. The city of Houston began to grow around the center of the Market Square and over the years was recognized as a blossoming national city. Although the Market Square has maintained much of its historic legacy, the area has gone through several restoration and landscaping projects. The Market Square Historic District has places for dining and sightseeing and many of the more contemporary restaurants and places are named directly after the Market Square itself; such as the Market Square Bar and Grill; an American restaurant that serves old fashioned burgers to hungry patrons walking through the area. The Market Square Historic District is also home to La Carafe. La Carafe attests firmly to the historical value of the Market Square by being the oldest bar in the Houston area. The commercial building the bar resides in is so old that it's listed on the national register for Historic places. The worn, peeling, shadowy concrete and solid structure of the building clearly portrays the authenticity of the Market Square District. Restaurants and places like La Carafe are not the only reason tourists frequent the Market Square Historic District in Houston. The historical district also offers incredible nightlife that caters to both the older and younger crowd. The nightlife within the Historic district of Houston has some officials and residents worried that the integrity of Market Square Historic District will be compromised as it becomes a place bombarded by youth who simply want to hop from club to club. Since 1997, attempts to delay the openings of new bars and the closing of old ones has helped the city and the area regain some of its original vision for Market Square Historic District. Market Square Historic District is complete with turn of the 20th century buildings that are well preserved. The beautiful architecture that radiates from the buildings turns the district into a great sightseeing area in Houston. The buildings are built in Victorian, Art-Deco, and Beaux Arts styles. It was at the Market Square that the city of Houston dedicated its first public monument."

"Medieval Times in Dallas","Texas","Medieval Times in Dallas","Medieval Times in Dallas is one of the city's most intriguing dining and entertainment spots. The venue is a combination of a medieval banquet and competitive show of jostling between Knights. Medieval Times is a creative and imaginative venue that attracts a special kind of visitor. The Medieval Times company has a mission of providing their customers with great entertainment and food. The experience is a transformative one that sends patrons backwards through time and into the 11th century. Visitors to the show act out the typical dinner-party scenario that would occur in 11th century Spain. During the 11th century, Royalty would invite guests over for dinner and entertainment. The entertainment was was watching Knights compete on horseback. Medieval Times in Dallas recreates this time and scenario for its customers. The first Medieval Times opened in Spain in 1973 and eventually reached the United States with its establishment in Florida. Since the Florida Medieval castle emerged eight other Medieval Times venues have been established through out the United States. Once the tickets are purchased to the show, visitors to the venue are instructed on what area of the arena to go to. They are then given a color coded crown. The crown symbolizes the royalty that watched the jostling knights. The color of the crown instructs the visitor on what color knight to cheer for. Because visitors to show are instructed to cheer and yell for their knight the actual show can get incredibly loud. Guests are then placed on benches with a bar-like table where the meal will be served. Guests at the Medieval Times are served a four-course banquet of tomato bisque, garlic bread, roasted chicken, potato, pastries and spare ribs. One of the low-points of the feast is that diners are only given a napkin and wet-nap in lieu of utensils. All food must be eaten with the hands because utensils were not used in the 11th century. While they are eating they can cheer for one of the knights that are competing in the joust. There are six Knights to choose from; Each knight has a different color costume by which they are recognized and a personalized background. For example, the Black & White Knight is the defender of the ancient shrine at Santiago de Compostela. The knights perform in a two hour competition of jostling, hand-to-hand combat, swordsmanship and displays of horsemanship. The horses are the another integral part of the show and deliver a performance to open the show. There are other entertainment aspects offered at Medieval Times besides the dinner and jostling knights. The venue has an area called Hall of Arms that displays medieval artifacts and a Medieval torture museum. In order for guests to attend the Medieval Times Castle reservations are strongly recommended. Seating and shows are limited and are given on a first serve basis.

"Memorial Park in Houston","Texas","Memorial Park in Houston","Memorial Park is located near the heart of downtown and is a favorite outdoor venue of many local Houston residents. The park is one of the largest urban getaways and offers many recreational opportunities. The park is rich in history and considered a lush urban gem by many. The majority of Memorial Park is located on the former grounds of a World War I facility called Camp Logan. The camp was used to train thousands of soldiers in the early 1900's. Eventually the camp was purchased by a family named the Hoggs, and in 1925, the City of Houston purchased the land from the family, transforming the space into a park. To honor the park's original history, the park was dedicated to the soldiers who lost their lives in World War I and named Memorial Park. Today, the park is over 1500 acres of wooded land, and is unique due is its location, size, and preservation of natural features. It is the 55th largest city park in the United States and in 2009, the park was said to have an estimate value of one billion dollars. The city of Houston is so enamored with Memorial Park that millions of dollars have been poured into upkeep and improvements to the park over the years. In early 2008, the mayor of Houston pledged to give the park an additional ten million dollars in funding to add even more amenities to Memorial Park over the upcoming years. Some of the amenities that the park currently has includes a fitness center, swimming pool, tennis center, infantry woods, picnic loop, baseball fields, soccer fields, and acres of beautiful gardens for nature or people-watching. The Memorial Park Picnic Loop is a multi-purpose trail that is open to roller skaters and road bikers. Mountain bikers have their own off-road trails that offer challenging terrain with ravines and slopes for an exciting ride. Most of the trails for mountain bikers are located in the southwest portion of Memorial Park. An advanced trail for mountain bikers is called the Infantry Woods and is designed for those with advanced bike handling skills and strength. An indoor gym is also located on park premises. The Memorial Park Fitness Center is situated in the middle of the park and open year round to the public. Daily or monthly use of the fitness gym requires a small fee. The gym is equipped with free-weight and resistance equipment and has shower facilities as well. There are a few educational facilities located on the premises of Memorial Park. The Houston Arboretum and Nature Center is located in the western portion of the park and was the first nature education facility in Texas. Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens, which is owned by the Museum of fine arts can also be found on the grounds of the park, and the Hogg Bird Sanctuary is also technically a part of Memorial Park. In order to preserve the integrity and beauty of Memorial Park, the Memorial Park Conservancy organization was formed. The Conservatory consists of 35 members who work with the Houston Parks and Recreation Department and other organizations to offer a wide range of activities at the park as well as preserve the natural habitat of Memorial Park. Four million locals and tourists visit Memorial Park every year and play a part in the recreational, fitness, and nature communities within the park."

"Midtown - Trendy and Pedestrian Friendly in Houston","Texas","Midtown - Trendy and Pedestrian Friendly in Houston"," The Midtown Neighborhood in Houston is a lesson in redevelopment. Since the beginning of the 20th century, it has morphed from a thriving residential neighborhood to a thriving commercial district and now it is a popular mixed-use neighborhood. Sometimes called Little Saigon'' because it once was home to a large Asian population, Midtown is now occupied by young professionals and families who enjoy the convenience of the neighborhood. Many residents enjoy the active lifestyle that is promoted by the walk-or-bike-everywhere philosophy. In the early 1900's, Midtown became the second residential neighborhood in Houston. Most of those who lived in Midtown were the families of those who had founded the Humble Oil and Refinery Company. With a decline in oil production later in the century, the neighborhood began to decline as well . A walk through Midtown today, however, would leave a visitor in doubt that it was ever anything but a hip and thriving community. There are modest apartments and luxury condos in Midtown. There are also abundant dining choices as well as shopping. Thanks to the Midtown Redevelopment Authority, the neighborhood continues to be improved upon and beautified through projects such as the addition of sidewalks, streetlights, a park and even a technology center. Additional improvement projects are completed by the Midtown Management District, which collects an assessment from both residential and commercial residents and uses those funds for marketing, public safety and service and maintenance projects. Some of the projects completed by this group include the purchase of bikes for use by the police department, opening a storefront police precinct in the neighborhood, the addition of street signs as well as several marketing efforts aimed at improving the image of the Midtown neighborhood. One of those marketing efforts was the creation of a Midtown newspaper, appropriately titled The Midtown Paper.''  The paper allows for the distribution of positive news about the area and provides a venue for local businesses to advertise directly to their target audience of Midtown residents. Because of the neighborhoods close proximity to Houston's medical centers and the financial district as well as all of the amenities that are within walking distance, many Midtown residents rarely need to drive. When residents do need to leave Midtown, there is an excellent public transportation system in place as well as easy access to the interstate . For many Houston residents, Midtown offers the best of both worlds: a close-knit community with big city amenities."
"Millermore Mansion in Dallas","Texas","Millermore Mansion in Dallas","The Millermore Mansion is located in the Dallas Heritage Village. The village is situated in a place called Old City Park that has a collection of historic buildings and homes that visitors can tour. One of those historic buildings is called the Millermore Mansion. The Millermore Mansion is named after the family that lived in the home for over one hundred years. In 1855, a man named William Brown Miller constructed the mansion and finished the completion just as the Civil War broke out. William Brown Miller was one of the most prosperous cotton planters and slave-owners in the Antebellum South. An adjacent house near the Millermore Mansion is called the Miller Log House. The Miller Log House was built in 1847 by William Brown Miller and his salves. The log cabin was created from real cedar and oak trees and was a temporary residence for William Miller until construction on his mansion could begin in 1855. Once Miller moved into the mansion, his slaves were given the log cabin as shelter. The Millermore Mansion is a two-story home that is considered by paranormal experts to be haunted.  Paranormal investigators have become increasingly interested in the eerie incidents that have allegedly occurred at the Millermore Mansion. Visitors, volunteers, and staff of the home have reported seeing the spirit of a woman present near the master bedroom of the mansion. Countless claims of visitors experiencing a presence or apparition have been recorded over the years. The most popular and interesting aspect of the Millermore Mansion is its reported haunting. The haunting of the mansion has been of special interest to numerous groups, locals, and tourists over the last thirty years. The mansion has even been featured on a science fiction television program called Ghosthunters where paranormal investigators use different mechanisms to detect the unseen activity of possible ghosts. Over the years, the Millermore Mansion began to crumble and was headed down the road of demolition by the city of Dallas. In 1968, a group of Dallas citizens called the Dallas County Heritage Society stepped in and saved the mansion and begin to have it restored and reserved as a historic building. By 1969, the Millermore Mansion opened as the first restored historic building in City Park. To date, it is the largest remaining historic mansion in the city of Dallas. Visitors who tour the Millermore Mansion feel as if they have stepped back in time. The mansion is well preserved through its structure and original furnishings give the ambiance of a home occupied by pioneers on the edge of the Civil War. The Millermore Mansion is built in a Greek Revival style and is two stories tall. Gorgeous antique furnishing from the Civil War period grace the home with its beauty. Fireplaces, old lamps, and wooden chairs and tables are placed carefully throughout the mansion. Group and individual tours of the home are available for a fee. The tour fee includes viewing several of the historical homes and buildings located in the Dallas Heritage Village."
"Minute Maid Park in Houston","Texas","Minute Maid Park in Houston","Since the famous Astrodome extracted the Houston Astros from their shelter of over thirty-five years, the Minute Maid Park has taken the Astros in and provided them with a new home to play baseball. Minute Maid Park in Houston does more than host baseball games. The Union Station ball park is also famous for hosting a variety of other events as well such as concerts and conventions. Minute Maid Park is located in the northeast portion of downtown Houston and in close proximity to the famous George R. Brown Convention Center. The park is capable of seating 42,000 visitors and occupies 29 acres of land. The Minute Maid Park in Houston opened in 2000 and was a substantial change from the Houston's former ballpark home that was in an enclosed dome with artificial grass. Minute Maid Park's real grass and open clear skies were immediately accepted by Houstonians and fans attended the first game held there in record numbers. Over three million fans attended in the 2000 season and the park has seen an estimated six million visitors since its doors opened. The Minute Maid Park was named after a Coca-Cola Product. It was given the name to honor the Coca-Cola Company for its heavy involvement in the construction and completion of the multimillion dollar baseball park. Coca-Cola's hundred million dollar investment in the park enabled them the rights to name the stadium for a length of twenty-eight years. The innovate retractable roof which only takes 12-20 minutes to open and close over the park allowed open-air baseball to played again in the city of Houston. The classic architecture of the stadium marks it as a ballpark that will move into history as one of Houston's future historic structures. The new stadium has literal ties to the past with its connection to Union Station. In the early 1900's, Houston's largest industry was composed of the railroad system . The railroads established the economic base for the metropolitan city that Houston is today. The Union Station transports baseball and concert fans into the stadium via a modern railway system. The designers of Minute Maid Park in Houston wanted a retro look to the theme park that would complement the timeless architecture of the structure. Six thousand retro green seats and panoramic views of the ballpark give the look and feel of an old time park that is newly renovated. The retractable roof on the Minute Maid Park dome comes in handy on particularly hot days because Houston is known for temperatures that exceed one hundred degrees in the summer. Visitors to Minute Maid Park give the park rave reviews for the physical comfort that the retractable roof provides and boast about clean bathrooms and easy flowing lines at concession stands. Great food, drinks, and atmosphere keeps Astros fans coming back to Minute Maid Park. The state of the art Minute Maid Park doesn't just bring in pleased fans but it also revitalizes a downtown area of Houston that has suffered tremendously due to ongoing construction projects."

"Mustang Island State Park","Texas","Mustang Island State Park, Port Aransas, TX","Mustang Island State Park in Port Aransas, Texas is on Mustang Island. The park is 3954 acres, which provides five miles of beach running along the Gulf of Mexico. The land was originally held by private owners, but in 1972 they sold the land to the state. It took seven years for the state to create a park out of it. Mustang Island State Park has a long history with various residents. The earliest people to stay on the island were Karankawa Native Americans. They were extremely fierce and cannibals. They also relied heavily on mussels and shellfish for food. In the 19th century the first Spanish explorers arrived on the island. Karankawa tribes still existed, but they did not last long into the 19th century. Mustang Island was first named Wild Horse Island; however, a few years later it was renamed to Mustang when Mestenos were brought by the Spaniards in the later 1800's. Despite the first settlement occurring in the 19th century, the Spanish knew of the island much earlier. Alonso Alvarez de Pineda charted the island in 1519. Captain Joaquin Orobioy Basterra even landed at the island, but he kept going. The heritage of Mustang Island is shared with visitors to Mustang Island State Park. The existing records Texas has of the island can be found at the visitor center of the state park, where it is possible to learn about the various settlers, the Civil War times, and much more. Ranching was very important in the 1880's on some of the state park land. Visitors to the park are able to camp, picnic, fish, swim, bike, or hike. The five miles of beach in the park are open for surfing, sunbathing, and kayaking. It is also a well known spot for bird watching during the fall and spring migrations. The state park offers tours in the visitor center to explain the ecology of the region. The tour guide takes guests around to the different ecosystems and explains the science behind it all. The campsites have water, electricity, shelters, and restrooms with showers. There are plenty of parking spaces, portable toilets, and rinsing showers for those who are not camping. Total there are 300 camping units. At certain times of the year the beach can be affected by red tide. The state park recommends calling ahead to find out if the beach and water are open. If it is guests can come to see the natural wonders of the area. Mustang Island is a barrier island with sand dunes. The wind will deposit the sand. The birds then bring the plant seeds for vegetation. The dunes can reach up to 35 feet, though 15 to 20 feet is more the average. Hurricanes can affect the beach, the island, and the state park. Entrance fees are $4 per day, per person for anyone 13 and older. School tours are required to make arrangements to ensure there is enough room and that the park is open."

Irving has the National Scouting Museum, which is the official museum of the Boy Scouts of America. The facility is at 1329 West Walnut Hill Lane. The museum was established in 1959 as a place to recount the history of the Boy Scouts. However, the museum was not located in Texas at that time. Instead the National Scouting Museum was in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The museum closed in 1979. Then in 1986 it was reopened at the campus of Murray State University in Kentucky. At this location about 120,000 people would visit annually from around the Land Between the Lakes region. Eventually the attendance fell to under 20,000 people in the 90's.

"Natural Bridge Caverns in San Antonio","Texas","Natural Bridge Caverns in San Antonio","The Natural Bridge Caverns are located seventeen miles north of San Antonio and are the largest stalactite caves in Texas. Stalactites are collected forms of a variety of minerals that are deposited slowly by dripping water. The deposited minerals come together and form a column which eventually looks like the form of ice crystals.  There are more than 10,000 different formations in the chambers of the cave and it has become a large tourist destination for people interested in the outdoors and nature. The cave system is both beautiful and historical and one of the most treasured natural attractions in Texas. Natural Bridge Caverns were discovered in 1960 by four college students from St. Mary's University in San Antonio. The students explored large underground passages that existed under a 60-foot limestone bridge in the area. They made four expeditions to the area before discovering additional rooms and passages throughout the cave. Once the students shared their discovery with the landowners of the Natural Bridge Caverns, the owners decided to share the caverns with the rest of the world. Since that time, the city has worked to preserve the cavern environment and give others the opportunity to explore such a natural treasure. The Natural Bridge Caverns provide educational once-in-a-lifetime experiences for those who visit its formations. Some of the most delicate and rare formations can be found in the chambers of the underground caves. Each chamber is intricately decorated with long soda straw stalactites and cave ribbons. The different sights offer visitors to the chambers so much to do, see, and learn. There is a popular tour that is offered through the Natural Bridge Caverns which is called the Discovery Tour. The Discovery Tour allows visitors to walk 180 feet below the ground and gain knowledge and insights about the history, biology, and environmental aspects of the cave from a professional tour guide. The Discovery Tour lasts through a half-mile of the largest show cavern in Texas. Tourists get the chance to take pictures of stones, soda straws, stalactites, stalagmites, and various other formations that they find throughout the Natural Bridge Caverns. The tour does have a fee of $18 for adults and $10 for children ages 3-11. The Discovery Tour lasts slightly over an hour and a half and a tour guide starts a new round every thirty minutes. A modern light system keeps the chambers uniquely lit to enhance the experience of traveling through the chambers. The temperature in the cave hovers around seventy degrees but the humidity is 99%. Because of the exceptionally high humidity most of the surfaces in the Natural Bridge Caverns are extremely wet. Tourists are required to wear comfortable walking shoes that provide traction on steep, slippery surfaces. Many tourists who explore the chamber take photographs to capture their memories. The prestigious USA Today publication named the Natural Bridge Caverns one of the top ten greatest places to get nature on film. For tourists around the country and world, the Natural Bridge Caverns are one of nature's most amazing places."

The maximum dept of the Palo Duro Canyon is over 800 feet; it is twenty miles wide and one-hundred-and-twenty miles long. The canyon is said only to be smaller than the Grand Canyon making it the United State's second largest. The Red River's Prairie Dog Town Fork caused the water erosion that formed the Palo Duro Canyon. Sediments are moved downstream by the water which deepens the canyon; it is widened by the water and wind erosion. The area is believed to have been found by Spanish Explorers that gave the canyon the name of Palo Duro which means hard wood in Spanish referring to the juniper and mesquite trees that are abundant in the area. The Palo Duro Canyon has been occupied by people for an estimated twelve thousand years. The area which is rick in history has been occupied by a variety of cultures. The JA Ranch was opened in the canyon by Charles Goodnight who went into the canyon in 1876. There were over 100,000 head of cattle supported by the ranch at its peak. It was operated by Goodnight until 1890 and while not as large as it once was the JA Ranch is still a working ranch.

"Pecan Valley Golf Club, San Antonio, Texas ? A Texas Golf Treasure, Restored to Its Former Glory","Texas","Pecan Valley Golf Club, San Antonio, Texas ? A Texas Golf Treasure, Restored to Its Former Glory","Pecan Valley Golf Club is considered one of golf's treasures, the very same course on which Arnold Palmer missed capturing a PGA Championship in 1968 when a 12-foot putt on the final hole wouldn't go down. The course has also been home to a number of Texas Opens in the late 60s, but over the years it slowly began losing a battle to flooding and neglect. In 1998, however, golf architect Bob Cupp undertook the project to renovate Pecan Valley, and the new'' Pecan Valley course has gotten rave reviews. Situated on 200 acres of historic land, the course is a picturesque layout, with huge, native pecan trees and live oaks. In fact, the trees and their long arms are such a hazard that many golfers might find themselves often punching shots out from beneath branches during the course of a round. Salado Creek comes into play frequently as well, winding through the front nine five times and three times on the back nine. The course also features strategically placed bunkers and some dogleg holes that have been known to frustrate golfers. The course, which was once a jungle, is located near the historic Goliad Road, constructed in 1720 by Spanish explorers. There's also a historic marker on the course which celebrates the Burnt Oak,'' a 100-foot-tall live oak with a girth of 22 feet.  Estimates place the age of the tree at around 800 years, and it is such a significant landmark that it was once used as a navigational guide. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 7,010 yards from the longest (Professional) tees, with a USGA rating for that length is 73.9 with a slope rating of 131 on Bermuda Grass fairways and Tifeagle greens. From the Club tees the course plays nearly a thousand yards shorter. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include the award-winning No. 2. This par-4 plays to 453 yards uphill and it ranks as the most difficult on the course. The real difficulty is on the approach, however, which must carry an elevated green with a false front, making club selection key on this hole. Hole No, 14 is the unofficial signature hole, a par-4 that plays to a length 467 yards from the back tees. The tee shot must carry water to a tree-lined fairway that doglegs right. The lake continues along the right side as players approach a huge green, which is again elevated, calling for precise club selection and accuracy. Since its renovation and re-opening, Pecan Valley has re-established its place in Texas golf. Local media and golf professionals even rated it the #1 upscale golf course in San Antonio, and Hole No. 2 the best in town. Golf Digest also recently ranked Pecan Valley one of the Top 25 Courses in the State. The course also features an enclosed air-conditioned and heated pavilion for events and gatherings."
"Peckerwood Garden","Texas","Peckerwood Garden - Peckerwood, TX - Aesthetic and Horticultural Reserve","Peckerwood Garden is located southeast of Hempstead, Texas, south of Business Route 290. The actual location is 20571 F.M. 359, Hempstead, TX, 77445. The Garden is operated by the Peckerwood Garden Foundation. The Foundation is a non-profit organization, founded in 1989, dedicated to the survival of the garden. The Foundation aims to preserve the property of the Garden by continuing explorations while developing the facilities of the Garden. John G. Fairey collected a number of seeds and samples during many trips through Texas and Mexico. Fairey, originally from South Carolina, came to Texas to study at Texas A&M. In 1971, he purchased the land for the Garden and began developing it. The Garden is currently nineteen acres and contains over 3,000 different species of plant life. The Garden exists for several reasons, according to Fairey. It is first of all a type of studio,'' where nature's artistry is appreciated. Fairey developed the Garden using his background in aesthetics to create a place where form, style, and color are stimulating and vibrant. Another purpose of the Garden is for horticultural and botanical research. The Garden tests and examines a multitude of new plant life and new methods of cultivation. Another goal of the Garden is to establish a cultural-botanical network between Mexico and Texas. This goal includes the preservation and conservation efforts that protect the variety of species from being lost due to environmental and economic factors. In the past, the Garden has been involved with distributing thousands of seeds and seedlings to various plant societies, including the J. C. Raulston Arboretum. Between 1988 and 1998, over 75 expeditions were made, including one sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. These explorations resulted in much of the research information and diversity of plants available in the Garden. Some of the plants there include the Magnolia grandiflora (magnolias), taxus, ilex (Holly), and liquidambar (sweetgum). The majority of these are flowering species and are native to the mountain ranges in the Mexico region. The Garden is only open for tours. These tours are between 1pm - 3pm on the Garden's open days. The Garden's open day schedule for 2010 is as follows: February 27, 28; March 27, 28; April 17, 18; May 8, 9; October 16, 17; November 6, 7.

This state park has 5211 acres of land in Blanco County. The actual location of the park is east of Johnson City. The land used for the state park was acquired from private land owners in 1970. It took a year for the park to open to the public as a place of recreation. Before the land was used as a park it was the Circle Bar Ranch. The land runs adjacent to Padernales River in a few areas and is typical of the Edwards Plateau region that it is located in. Pedernales River has been known to flash flood on occasion and without warning. For this reason rangers monitor the river and though they allow swimming in its waters they ask for extreme caution. Water comes from other rivers and lakes of Texas, as well as rain. In recent years Texas has suffered from a mild drought keeping the river at fairly good levels. Before arriving at the park it is best to check with the rangers regarding the water levels and expected weather conditions. Pedernales River slopes downward, with banks running under the water. This creates a small waterfall effect and numerous rapids. Camping in Pedernales State Park is available. There are camping sites away from the river, and a youth group camping region. Recreation begins at the Youth Group Camping area and extends to the down river park boundary.

Adults are $5, Students $3 and children five and under are free to enter. The first area of the museum is the Dambach Besier House. It has stood at 515 East Main Street for 135 years. It was moved to 325 Main Street and reconstructed as the entrance to the museum. It is the Fredericksburg Convention and Visitor Center. The house is made of limestone, having been built in 1869. Dambach first built the house and then sold it to the Besier family for $400 in 1881. The Besier Family sold it to Sam Park, Henry Joseph, JD Stein, Kenneth Kothe, and Ty Cox in 1967. The partnership created a Sunday House Restaurant and Convention Center. The Historical Society gained the house when Kenneth and JoAnn Kothe donated it in 2005. The house was disassembled completely in order to move it. The Historical Society called this phase one of their History in the Making Campaign. They have since worked to gain more historical artifacts for preservation. The Kammlah House which was built in 1849 is a one room place with three kitchens, a cellar, stone patio, bedrooms, and living areas. The Historical Society gained possession of this building in 1955. Four generations of Kammlah's lived in the house and then they donated it. A barn and smokehouse were part of the original property. The Kammlah's were also instrumental in operating a general store in the front rooms of the house between 1870 and 1924. The Fassel Roeder House is also part of the Pioneer Museum. This house began as a one room butcher shop, with a kitchen, living area, and front porch being added later. There was a coin operated music box inside that originated from Leipzig.

Antares is a full service restaurant that is owned by the Hyatt Regency Dallas. The restaurant revolves slowly giving diners a full 360 degree view of Dallas. The third level is called The Dome which is a cocktail lounge where patrons can order drinks or appetizers in a relaxing environment. The restaurant is the most exciting part of the tower. It revolves slowly around allowing patrons to fully take in the entire city of Dallas.  Those dining would need to sit in the restaurant for at least an hour to revolve completely around once. The restaurant that is located in Reunion Tower doesn't get as many high marks as the tower itself. While there are plenty of satisfied customers who enjoyed the ambiance and food at the restaurant, there have been numerous accounts of patrons dissatisfied with service, quality, and price at the restaurant. The third floor on the reunion tower is for cocktails. From the Reunion Tower patrons can see the city for miles. In the evening, the view is enhanced by the clusters of city lights. The Reunion Tower itself gives off a beautiful view to outsiders when the sun sets. At night, the Reunion Tower creates a festive ambiance to the downtown Dallas skyline. There are 260 light bulbs fixated to the tower that blink in different computerized patterns. In 2007, renovations on the tower began with promises of completion in 2009. The Reunion Tower has been a part of the Dallas skyline for decades and will continue to be a permanent fixture well into the future."
"Rice University Art Gallery","Texas","Rice University Art Gallery, Houston, TX","Museums and art galleries are a wonderful way to learn about a culture, heritage, and modern times. The Rice University Art Gallery in Houston, Texas is located in the Houston Museum District. However, this art gallery is unlike any other in the United States. It commissions site specific art. Five times each year the gallery will invite an artist. This artist is to design a room sized piece of art that will transform the gallery space. The artists can be students, famous artists, or little known artists. The idea is to give the local community something to look forward to each year, at various times of the year. Rice Gallery is located at Sewall Hall on 6100 Main Street. Hours of operation are Tuesday through Saturday 11am to 5pm,though the gallery stays open until 7pm on Thursdays and opens Sunday from noon to 5pm. Rice Art Gallery is closed on Mondays. Admission into the gallery is free, and all public are encouraged to attend. For those who are in the Houston area the Rice University Art Gallery can be part of the top destinations one must visit. This concept was created in 1995, and since then they have had more than 40 different artists and work. Much of the artists works are contemporary art. Each year they draw about 40,000 visitors from around the globe and most particularly from the USA. The concept of the design allows you to move through the art. The building set up is such that you do not mingle with others over a painting, but experience the piece designed. Since the exhibits change five times a year it is hard to name what one will see on a visit to the gallery. However, for 2010 El Anatsui Gli is on display until March 14th, 2010. El Anatsui is a native of Ghana. The artist resided in Nigeria from 1975 to the present working with wood, ceramics, and paint. Anatsui is a respected artist and teacher of Africa, and ten years ago became known in the USA. Slated for April to August 2010 is artist Andrea Dezso. The work of art Dezso will be creating is not discussed, nor is there information from the Art Gallery on the artist. An artist from a past exhibit was Wayne White. He created Big Lectric Fan to Keep Me Cool While I Sleep in 2009. As an artistic piece it was certainly interesting. It was an old man's head, lying as if in sleep with a mechanical mouth. El Anatsui has created a large wall that moves through the space. It looks like sandstone, with doors in parts, but mostly it is the weaving of bottle caps and other objects that makes the artist's rendering something to examine. For a visitor the Rice University Art Gallery is something to see because of the changing art. One may not like what is on display or it may be something that will not leave the mind."

Unfortunately, in 2001 the cinema was closed, but not before it became a dollar cinema brand. The building was converted into an Inflatable Wonderland. In 1992 the mall was able to expand making way for the other two anchor stores, yet it took until 2004 for JC Penney to move into the mall.

"San Antonio Zoo","Texas","San Antonio Zoo","The San Antonio Zoo originally started off as the San Pedro Park in the 1800's. It was a small collection of animals assembled at the park and in 1914, the park began to take shape when George W. Brackenridge placed deer, monkeys, elk, buffalo, bears, and a couple of lions in San Pedro. By then, the land had transformed from being known as San Pedro Park to being called Brackenridge Park. The park would eventually house the collection of animals that soon became the San Antonio Zoo. The zoo has gone through many changes since the first dozen animals were assembled in Brackenridge Park. San Antonio Zoo is now home to more than 3,800 animals that come from 750 different species. San Antonio Zoo is filled with educational exhibits that educate the general public about a variety of animal species. There are eleven current exhibits that can be explored at the zoo. The exhibits are named Rift Valley, Cranes of the World, Richard Friedrich Aquarium, Hixon Bird House, Reptile House, Lory Landing, Attwater's Prairie Chicken, Gibbon Forest, Butterflies, Kronkosky's Nature Spot, and the African Plains. Two of the first cage-less exhibits in America could be seen in the zoo in 1929. The opened areas offered visitors unprecedented views of the animals for the first time. The newest exhibit in the San Antonio Zoo is Africa Live. Visitors of the zoo can experience the world of Africa and are exposed to eight thousand pound hippos, ten foot crocodiles, exotic plants, and a street market that is modeled after the Nanyuki Market located in Africa. San Antonio Zoo also has one of the largest bird collections in the United Sates. The Hixon Bird House is home to thousands of birds that are located in a circular glass-domed building with large trees, low plants, numerous shrubs and a small pond. Birds from all over the world can be found at the Hixon Bird House. San Antonio Zoo is very child-friendly and promotes educational activities for children eighteen years and under. One particular exhibit that caters to toddlers is called the Kronkosky's Tiny Tot exhibit. The exhibit is a nature spot for toddlers and allows them to explore the world through digging and climbing. The area only caters to children under the age of five. The Tiny Tot Nature Spot allows kids to have a hands-on experience and participate in activities such as releasing ladybugs, uncovering worms, or feeding carrots to guinea pigs. Frequent visitors to the zoo can become members through the Adopt-An-Animal Program. The program helps the zoo provide for the feeding and care of the animals. Members receive perks in return such as guest passes, animal fact sheets, or invitation to annual membership parties depending on the amount of money pledged in the program. Members who participate in the program enjoy perks for one year and can choose which animal they wish to adopt. Educational events are another major source of revenue for the San Antonio Zoo. Tours, camps, game nights, and dining events occur frequently and are normally accompanied by an educational theme that combines entertainment with learning. Each year locals are invited to register for the summer camps that cater to children."
"San Antonio Zoological Gardens & Aquarium","Texas","San Antonio Zoological Gardens & Aquarium - San Antonio, Texas - large zoo and aquarium","The San Antonio Zoologicial Gardens & Aquarium can trace its history back to the 1800s, but its real birth was in 1914, when Colonel George W. Breckinridge deeded a parcel of land to the city of San Antonio. That land that became the San Antonio Zoo housed a pair of lions, four bears, monkeys, elk, deer and buffalo. In 1929, the San Antonio Zoo made history with two of the country's first cageless exhibits, the Barless Bear Terraces and the Primate Paradise. It was typical of the zoo, which has often been on the forefront in animal management and conservation. In 1948, the San Antonio Zoo added the Richard Friedrich Aquarium to its exhibits, becoming one of the few zoos in the world that featured both land animal exhibits and an aquatic environment. In 1966, the zoo opened the Hixon Bird House, an aviary housing tropical birds in a simulated rain forest setting which allowed them free flight. The San Antonio Zoo now houses one of the largest collections of birds in the world. The Hixon Bird House is still the centerpiece of that bird collection. The building is home to many glass-fronted enclosures with wire mesh roofs open to the elements in order to simulate the natural environment as closely as possible. Each enclosure is a diorama that features an environment as close as possible to the bird's natural home. There are birds from Africa, North and South America and the jungles of Asia. Visitors have a chance to watch the famed roadrunner of the American Southwest, the fairy bluebird of Asia and the quetzal of the South American Rain Forest. From the air to the sea - one of the most popular exhibits at the San Antonio Zoo is the Friedrich Aquarium. With 24 tanks of tropical fish, the Aquarium features such unusual specimens as the chocolate chip starfish, moon jellyfish and venomous lionfish. The Aquarium is also home to an alligator snapping turtle who is estimated to be 40-50 years old. While many zoos feature animals from the Asian, South American and African rainforests, far fewer have displays devoted to the Australian rain forests. Visitors to the San Antonio Zoo can enjoy a stroll through Lory Landing, an Australian rain forest setting where lorikeets fly free. Lorikeets, small cousins to parrots, are gregarious and friendly birds that will happily perch and feed from a cup of nectar held by a guest. The antics and friendliness of the lorikeets make Lory Landing another of the most popular destinations at the zoo. Amazonia and Africa Live! represent two very different continents in very memorable ways. Amazonia, located along the zoo's waterway, is home to 30 species of tropical animals and dozens of species of tropical plants. The highlights of the display include the pygmy marmoset, the smallest of the South American monkeys, and the jaguar and ocelot. Plants include many rare tropical plants that were confiscated from smugglers at the border. Africa Live! is an immersive, interactive exhibit that is a must-see for any visitor to the zoo. The exhibit focuses on the relationship of animal life and its adaptations to the availability of water. It features interpretive guides, interactive learning stations and the unique Nanyuki Market, a model of an actual street market in Africa. The San Antonio Zoo is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. 365 days a year. Admissions are nominal, and discounts are available for the military, senior citizens, groups and others. For more information on the San Antonio Zoo's admissions and scheduled events, contact the zoo at (210) 734-7184."

The courthouse was built in 1893 in the Victorian style. The house itself is listed on the national register of historic landmarks. The exterior was created with limestone. This court house was not built the first time court was in session. Instead across the street from the museum in a local store called Barnards Mill was the original court house. A log cabin was used later, and eventually a 3rd courthouse erected in 1882 hosted court proceedings. Unfortunately in 1883 the court house caught fire and burned. Since the records were lost in the fire and the town really needed to have a courthouse they built the structure that now houses the museum. The new courthouse had a fireproof vault, and was made of limestone so it would not burn down. A few of the artifacts have been mentioned above that are located in the museum. Some other displays one might find there include the relics from Native Americans and pioneer days. In fact a whole display of the pioneers moving west from the east can be seen at Somervell County Museum. The museum has a number of rooms for each display.

"South Padre Island, Texas","Texas","South Padre Island, Texas - South Padre Island, TX - Gulf Coast Tourist Hot Spot Off of the Southern Tip of the Lone Star State","South Padre Island, Texas, is located on the Gulf Coast at the Southeast tip of the State, just northeast of Brownsville. The longest bridge in Texas, the 2.5 mile Queen Isabella Causeway, brings vehicles from the mainland, across the Laguna Madre Bay, to the southern section of this island. Two international airports, Harlingen and Brownsville, are located close by. There are three roadways that run from south to north on the narrow island street grid. Padre Boulevard which connects with the Causeway is the longest. On the western side is Laguna Boulevard and on the eastern side is Gulf Boulevard.  The island is 34 miles long and its coasts are covered in white sand on both the Bay and Gulf Coast sides. In recent years South Padre Island has become a Mecca for meetings and conventions. South Padre Island, Texas has recorded sightings of more than 300 species of birds. Dolphin sightings are also common from this island looking out onto the Gulf of Mexico. Windsurfing, sailing, fishing and swimming are among the most common water activities for visitors and residents alike. There is a bird sanctuary on the island and a Laguna Madre Nature Trail that extends for 4 acres provides for excellent bird watching in this area that is frequented by migratory birds for feeding. The trail is wheelchair accessible. In the summer of 2008, the South Padre Island Birding and Nature Center opened here on the Laguna Madre Coast with a 10,000 sq. ft. Visitor's Center hosting exhibits. As part of the same project the Nature Trail had new boardwalks and blinds for bird watching installed. There are several full service medical clinics as well as dental and chiropractic services on the island. Of the nearly 3,000 residents here roughly 47% are female while the majority is male. The median household income here is slightly higher than it if for the rest of the State of Texas. The median home value however is nearly twice as much here than it is on the average for the state. 75% of the island's inhabitants are white while 22% are Hispanic and the rest are of different backgrounds. The crime rate here is much higher than the average crime rate in the US; crime is possibly attracted by the tourism, which is in large part business and convention related here. South Padre Island, Texas, was first seen by Europeans in 1519 when Alonso Alvarez de Pineda was mapping the Gulf of Mexico and named it Isla Blanca. The now extinct Karankawa people inhabited the island at the time. In the years to come numerous Spanish Galleons were shipwrecked on the sandbars near the island frustrating Hernan Cortez in his efforts to ferry gold pillaged from the Aztecs back to Spain. For years pirates scoured the area and the island in search of the lost wealth. Permanent settlements were never constructed here until modern times."

This is just 10 miles southwest of downtown Dallas, at the interchange between US 67 and Interstate 20. Southwest Center Mall is a two story enclosed beautiful shopping center that nests over a hundred stores with an exciting mix of department and specialty retail stores. Open since 1975 (originally named the Red Bird Mall), Southwest Center Mall consists of over 1,084,528 sq. ft. of retail space and is home to anchor stores Sears, Burlington Coat Factory, and Macy's. With several restaurants you have a choice of fast fare or a full service restaurant. Initially, the mall was anchored by four department stores: Sears, which anchored the eastern end of the mall J.C. Penney, which anchored the western end of the mall Sangar - Harris (later Foley's, now Macy's), whose store was in the middle of the mall on the northern side Tiche's (later Joske's, then purchased by and renamed Dillard's), whose store was in the middle of the mall on the southern side Later, Montgomery Ward added a store near the Sears location, on the same side of the mall as Dillard's. Many of the stores in the mall were either opening their first stores in the southern s The mall did well in the beginning, despite its location in the relatively undeveloped southern portion of Dallas. Much of its early success can be attributed to the lack of competing malls and its location near the intersection of U.S. Route 67 and Interstate 20. Soon after its completion, the mall's customer base began to weaken due to what is known as white flight. Competition further contributed to the mall's decline: newer malls in Arlington, Grand Prarie, and nearby Cedar Hill, have all attracted shoppers away from Red Bird Mall. After losing some of it's retaail stores and customers to other malls, this shopping center is not as large or active as it had been in past years but loyal customers and local residents have kept it going. DeBartolo attempted to remodel the mall to give it an updated look and to attract new tenants, but it did little to overcome the its lost customer base. In 1997, the mall was sold to NAMCO Financial, a California investment group. It was at this time that NAMCO changed the name to Southwest Center Mall in an attempt to rebrand it, but the company had no better success.

"Spanish Governor's Palace in San Antonio","Texas","Spanish Governor's Palace in San Antonio","Spanish Governor's Palace is considered a national historic landmark.  The stately building was constructed in the eighteen century and was originally built to protect the nearby Alamo mission and a growing colony. Part of the building's historical significance rests in it being the only example of an aristocratic Spanish house that is left in Texas. The building has been praised by numerous historical societies and was once identified as the most beautiful building in San Antonio. Most theories suggest that the Spanish Governor's Palace was constructed in the 1720's and has been used for various reasons over the years. The building is located near both downtown and the San Antonio River Walk. The Spanish Governor's Palace is one story tall and consists of ten grand rooms with very low ceilings and doorways. The walls and doors in the palace are about 2 feet thick and attest to the firm structural integrity of Spanish Colonial buildings constructed during that time. Each room in the palace is decorated with furnishing from the period that depicts the type of upper-class life the aristocrats who owned the palace once lived. The palace also has a cobblestone courtyard that is adorned with a fountain and shaded by trees. The most ornate decoration at the Spanish Governor's Palace is found on a keystone that hangs above the front doors. It is an ornate sculpture of an eagle with a simple version of the coat of arms of King Ferdinand VI of Spain. When the Spanish Governor's Palace was originally built, its main purpose was to protect the Alamo Mission but eventually the palace became the place where the Texas government resided. In 1772, the old palace was established as the capital building in the Texas region for the Spanish province. The palace has also served as a shop, barroom, and even a schoolhouse. Because the building is beautifully simple, it has the ability to convert into multiple spaces. One of the most peculiar aspects of the Spanish Governor's Palace is the recorded ghost sightings that have occurred inside the palace and courtyards. Visitors can attend a ghost tour of the place that tells the story of early Spanish America. The ghost sightings are connected to a small girl who was buried in the interior of the palace's walls. Visitors are permitted to enter the Spanish Governor's Palace for a nominal fee. Adults are charged $2 and children are only charged $1. Tours of the facilities are self-guided. Touring the Spanish Governor's Palace gives visitors a chance to learn about both Spanish and Texas political history. Visitors who desire a more in-depth tour of the palace are encouraged to come on the last Sunday of the month. During this time, a living history group called the La Compania de Cavalleria shares information with visitors about the palace's history. Today, the Spanish Governor's Palace serves as a tribute to Spanish life in the 18th century. Tourists who enter the palace doors feel as if they have taking a step back in time. The property is currently owned by the city of San Antonio in 1928 and maintained as a historical museum."

The labor to build the park came when President FDR created the Works Progress Administration to put America back to work after the Great Depression in 1935. Local unemployed people were put to work with the federal funds to build the concession, restrooms and boardwalk. In 1941 this beach first opened.

"Stonehenge II","Texas","Stonehenge II, Kerrville, Texas","Stonehenge is one of the most well known landmarks in the UK. People have heard of the famous stones set up in a circle and marvel at how this came to be. In Kerrville, Texas it is possible to visit a re-creation of Stonehenge. Kerrville is home to Stonehenge II. Stonehenge II was actually created by Al Shepperd and Doug Hill. Al Shepperd created Stonehenge II as an amusing art project. His neighbor, Doug Hill helped out by offering a limestone slab to Shepperd. This occurred in 1989. Shepperd decided to place the slab in the monolith style. After the first slab it seemed like a fever over took Al because he began to erect more stones in a Stonehenge re-creation. In a year both Shepperd and Hill were able to bankroll the project using plaster and graphite that covered the metal mesh and steel frameworks they built. They replicated the original Stonehenge, but made it 90 percent of the width of the original and only 60 percent the height. Shepperd then had the idea to enhance his Stonehenge even more, by building two 13 feet statures like the Easter Island heads. It took a year and a half for this to be added. It was only after a visit to Easter Island that Shepperd even came up with the idea. Al was going to put up an Alaskan Totem Pole, as well, but unfortunately he died in 1994 before he could add this to the yard. Al Shepperd, the nephew, now owns the property. Seeing the creation of his uncle, Al felt it would be a great thing to give tour permission to visitors. Anyone who comes to Kerrville is able to self tour the site. The site has a sign explaining the whole concept, and what the Shepperd's had hoped to accomplish. The stones are actually about eight feet tall. The metal inside will ring if they are tapped, creating an eerie sound. Local birds have even built nests on the site in a couple of places, so visitors should look out for nature's adaptations to Stonehenge II. The sign at the entrance allowing visitors in reads Its purpose is unknown, and perhaps, unknowable.'' To reach Stonehenge II one must drive 80 miles west of San Antonio to Hunt, and then on to Kerrville. Take highway I-10 to Highway 39 and then drive two miles west. The land is open during the daylight hours only. There is no charge for walking to Stonehenge II. The nephew just allows visitors, and truthfully he doesn't usually see too many of them. Most visitors will find they are alone. Children tend to love viewing the structure because the stones are high in the air and it is quite different from other options. Kerrville has more to offer than just Stonehenge II. However, for anyone looking for a free exhibit this is the one.

"Swiss Avenue in Dallas","Texas","Swiss Avenue in Dallas","Swiss Avenue is located in East Dallas and was originally developed in 1905 by Collett and R.S. Munger. The Mungers envisioned creating a neighborhood in close proximity to downtown Dallas. The two wanted an avenue close to the downtown area so that the residents could have some involvement in urban life. The street is an elegant historical district that is approximately 2.5 miles long. Swiss Avenue has so much historic value that it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places back in March, 1974. There are 200 preserved and restored homes on Swiss Avenue that range in many styles. The main styles of homes on Swiss Avenue are Mediterranean, Spanish, Georgian, Prairie, Craftsman, Neoclassical, Tudor, Colonial Revival, and Italian Renaissance. Colonial revival homes are typically brick or wood, Neoclassical homes have grand front porches that are supported by white columns, and Spanish homes can easily be identified by the white stucco walls, arches, and courtyards. One thing that all of the homes on Swiss Avenue have in common is their beautiful symmetry, balance, and elegance. The historical homes in the area have transformed Swiss Avenue into a popular tourist destination. Tourists are attracted to the area to see some of the finest 20th century architecture in the city. Tourists should be aware that they are not allowed to enter the historical homes in the area - they are only allowed to view them. Swiss Avenue is considered to contain some of the most distinguished early 20th century homes in the Southwest. The entire Swiss Avenue Historic District expands beyond Swiss Avenue and includes Bryan Parkway, La Vista Avenue, Live Oak Street, and Bryan Street. The homes that are for sell in the prestigious area easily exceed values of one million dollars due their historical significance. There are two noteworthy blocks on Swiss Avenue. The blocks are named after the original settlers who purchased the land and begin to develop families and communities there. Wilson Block is the first street of note. Wilson block is named after Henrietta Frichot Wilson who was the niece of the Swiss natives who originally owned the territory. The second block is the Beilharz Block. The historical Beilharz block is named after Theodore Beilharz, the original builder of the structures on the block. The Beilharz block was built between 1887 and 1901. It was restored by the Meadows Foundation in 1984. Swiss Avenue has its own neighborhood watch team called The Swiss Avenue Alliance Against Crime. The crime-watching team was created in 1990 and is a non-for-profit organization. Swiss Avenue Alliance Against Crime keeps the area safe by hiring off duty Dallas police officers to patrol the neighborhood in marked, computer-equipped squad cars. The officers respond to 911 calls, ticket speeders, rescue lost pets, and stop any offenses on Swiss Avenue. Residents contribute $50.00 per month in order to pay for the Dallas police officers and so far the presence of police has decreased the amount of crime on Swiss Avenue."

"Texas State Aquarium","Texas","Texas State Aquarium - Corpus Christi, Texas - large aquarium featuring Gulf animals","In 1969, the Junior League of Corpus Christi and the Jaycees in that part of the state formed the Gulf Coast Zoological and Botanical Society with the goal of creating the Texas State Aquarium, a new aquarium in Texas' Corpus Christi area. They later changed their name to the Corpus Christi Aquarium Association, and even later named it the Texas State Aquarium Association and declared the proposed facility to be the Official Aquarium of Texas.'' Construction began on the aquarium in 1988, and they opened their first building, the Gulf of Mexico Exhibit, in 1990. Today, one of the most popular exhibits at the Texas State Aquarium is Dolphin Bay. This 400,000-gallon tank has three male dolphins that guests can view from a huge 70-foot window, as well as viewing areas above the water. They also have daily dolphin shows, and guests can sign up for the Deckside Dolphin Encounter of the dolphin Trainer for a Day program to get up close and personal to these creatures. Along with the dolphin exhibit, the aquarium's otter exhibit is extremely popular. There, guests can see North American River Otters. These otters play with one another and interact with trainers throughout the day. Nearby, guests can see Tortuga Cay, home of the aquarium's sea turtles, along with The Floating Phantoms exhibit, the aquarium's 800-gallon tank featuring Pacific sea nettles, moon jellies, purple stripe jellies, and a number of other various jellyfish species. One of the newest exhibits at the Texas State Aquarium is Eagle Pass. In 2009, this exhibit opened to feature raptors that were rescued and treated after injuries in the wild. The rocks in this exhibit are 60 feet high and mimic the wall of a canyon. They serve as a home for the zoo's three raptors, including Grace, an Alaskan bald eagle. The original Gulf of Mexico exhibit has now become Islands of Steel, an exhibit that shows life around a gulf oil platform. The aquarium supports the Rigs to Reefs program, which advocates the existence of these platforms, even after companies are done using them. In the past, they were destroyed, which destroyed the habitat of the animals that had begun to live there. Some of the fish found in this huge indoor exhibit include green morays, spadefish, tarpons, sand tiger sharks, and nurse sharks. Many of these kinds of fish also appear in the Flower Gardens, a replica coral reef found in a 40,000-gallon tank. Other animals found in this part of the aquarium include French angelfish, cow-nose stingrays, porcupine fish, and barracuda. The aquarium has daily string ray feeding shoes for guests to see. Other daily shows include diving and hand-feeding the animals, the Wild Flight Show, and keeper chats at the otter, stingray, and reptile exhibits.

"The Astrodome","Texas","The Astrodome","The Astrodome which at one time was called the eighth wonder of the world, is best known for being the home of the Houston, Astros baseball team. The Astrodome is the brain child of former Houston Mayor, Roy Hofheinz who loved baseball. The inspiration for the Astrodome came to Mayor Roy Hofheinz while visiting the Coliseum in Rome. The mayor wanted to bring baseball to Houston in an enclosed venue so that bad or strange weather occurrences would not interrupt a game. The Astrodome was the first ballpark with a roof propped on top of it. The Astrodome was completed in 1964 and was officially opened in April of 1965. The Astrodome covers over 9.5 acres of land and derives its name from the Baseball team that is was home to for more than thirty-five years, the Astros. One of the most famous things the Astrodome was originally known for was its two million dollar scoreboard that occupied more than 470 feet of space. The scoreboard was eventually taken away to enhance the amount of seating options available. The Astrodome was named for the prominent role that the city of Houston played in the country's space program. Eventually the Houston Baseball Team which was initially named The Colt 45s was renamed for the dome and took on the name the Astros. The very first game played by the Astros was against the Yankees who were defeated. At the time, people across the country were so fascinated by the structure of the Astrodome over 47,000 fans attended the first game including President Lyndon B. Johnson and the First Lady. The structure of the Astrodome is amazing in and of itself. The dome is more than eighteen stories tall and has solid structural integrity created with steel triangle bars. Engineers of the Astrodome bragged that the air conditioning system was so overwhelming powerful they could produce snow within the dome under certain conditions. Most importantly, it was the the Astrodome that led to the ingenuous invention of astroturf. Astroturf is a supernaturally green artificial grass that doesn't require any mowing. The invention of astroturf was such a success that it is still currently being used in sports facilities around the United States and Europe. Because The Astrodome ushered in the area of indoor sports stadiums it stands in Houston as a historic building, mostly unused as of 2009. Unfortunately, the splendor that was once the Astrodome has been overshadowed by the Reliant Energy Stadium which boast of newer technology such as a retractable roof.  Although the dome is currently not occupied two possible plans of reconstruction are underway. There are two plans currently underway. One plan intends to turn the Astrodome into a 1,300 room luxury hotel. The second plan is encouraging the use of The Astrodome as a movie production studio. In spite of the elaborate plans to make use of the 9 acre unused dome, The Astrodome will continue to go down as a historic structure with multiple uses and changes throughout the years."

The Traveler's Hotel was able to stay open during this time mostly because of Walter Faust Sr. In 1936 the hotel was renamed Faust and New Braunfels was given the nickname The Honeymoon Capitol.'' World War II was on its way to beginning and soldiers were departing from a nearby base. The soldiers used the hotel to commit to their brides before they went to war. The hotel was sold to Arlen Krueger who could not make it work. The hotel was closed in 1975, but eventually reopened in 1977 due to Jackson- Houser and Associates. Though it has changed hands a few times, the Faust Hotel has been renovated since 1977 when it reopened and continues to be a place to stop.

"The Kingwood Neighborhood in Texas; Planned Community with Wide Open feel","Texas","The Kingwood Neighborhood in Texas; Planned Community with Wide Open feel","The Kingwood neighborhood in Texas is a planned community that is located on a major highway about twenty-five minutes away from Houston. The community currently has 65,000 residents and plans to stop building when there are 70,000 full time residents. There are three developments currently being built in the community, Kingwood, Oakhurst, and Kings Manor. There are many affordable homes that begin at $150,000 dollars, but there also some very high end homes that will cost more than $1,000,000. As you can see there will be a broad spectrum of potential buyers in the area. Kingwood is divided in neighborhoods and each neighborhood will supply specific services to its residents. Kingwood operates its own schools and libraries including a community college. The Kingwood subdivisions are called villages in the community and each village has its own community pool and recreation center. This allows the neighbors to have a central attraction which promotes community living. The Kingwood development is unique in that it is dependant upon Houston for many services such as police, fire, and emergency medical, but it is clearly not part of the City of Houston. The village pools, for instance, are not open to people who do not live in the community. Kingwood is located in a desirable location because it is close enough to Houston to make city living an easy task, but far enough away to escape many of the problems associated with living in the city. There is relatively little crime in Kingwood, it has one of the largest country clubs in the state, and is easily accessible by Bush Intercontinental Airport. The community is actively pursuing new residents at this time and there are several homes on the market. The residents of Kingwood commute to Houston to work for the most part, but many are able to find employment without leaving the neighborhood. There are many restaurants and businesses in Kingwood and according to the Kingwood Chamber of Commerce more are being added every day. For those who do commute to Houston there are many opportunities in business, real estate, transportation, and oil industries. Kingwood is a planned community and it shows. There is relatively little traffic and the streets are laid out in an intuitive way. For a place that is just twenty minutes from Houston the Kingwood neighborhood has done a great job of avoiding the traps of big city life."

The lights were first written about during 1957 although there were stories of them as far back as the 1800's. The lights are described as being shaped like spheres approximately the size of basketballs or soccer balls that float over the ground. The color of the Marfa Mystery Lights is normally described as being red, yellow, orange or white although they have been said to be blue and green at times. The lights have been seen hovering at approximately shoulder height, moving rapidly in various directions or moving slowly in a lateral direction. Reports have the lights showing up in groups or pairs that either divide or merge, they also disappear and reappear. The lights sometimes appear to move in regular patterns. Robert Reed Ellison was a young cowhand who saw the lights during a cattle drive through Paisano Pass during 1883. He believed that the lights were Apache Indian campfires, when he and other settlers went to investigate in the area they did not see any traces of previous fires in the area. IN 1885 Sally and Joe Humphrey's also reported seeing the lights. In 1919 the source of the Marfa Mystery Lights was searched for by cowboys that were herding cattle across the prairie with no success. The Marfa Mystery Lights were feared by those that observed them during the 1st World War as they thought they were going to be utilized to lead an invasion. The source of the lights was searched for by pilots undergoing training at the Midland Army Air Field during the 2nd World war from their planes without success. The source of the Marfa Mystery Lights has caused the residents of Marfa, Texas to wonder for years, they even made Unsolved Mysteries due to their unknown origin. The origin of the Marfa Mystery Lights has been credited to everything from swamp gas, ghosts, being a mirage to traffic on the highway. The lights have never been seen close up only from a distance and are becoming a tourist attraction for the town of Marfa, Texas. The lights are so popular that a parking area was built by the highway department along U.S. Highway 90 nine miles from Marfa so that passing motorists could stop to enjoy them. The Marfa Mystery Lights are only seen during the night and the viewings can be years apart. The source of the lights is still unknown and everyone that has reported seeing them has reported seeing something different. Each year on the Labor Day Weekend the Marfa Lights Festival is held during which there is dancing and music for the community's enjoyment. Anyone in the area of Marfa, Texas traveling along Highway 90 should take the time to stop and view the Marfa Mystery Lights.

"The Rawls Course","Texas","The Rawls Course, Lubbock, Texas - A University Golf Course Ranked Among the Very Best","The Rawls Red Raider'' Course is a Tom Doak design, located at the edge of the Texas Tech University campus. Starting with a flat piece of land, Doak moved 1.3 million cubic yards of topsoil to sculpt a parkland course with vast, rolling fairways, elevation changes of up to 30 feet, and large, undulating greens. Doak's goal was to create a course that emulates the eroded features and canyons of the South Plains Caprock region, and the fairway contours, the bunkers and rough are all reminiscent of those gouged-out landforms as well as his fondness for Scottish links-style golf. The course, which opened in 2003, features fairways that cater to big hitters off the tee, with Tif-sport Bermuda grass that allows the ball to roll for long distances. The fairways are also wide, but the course also features 96 sand bunkers that are rather unusual for a Texas layout. Many are deep and nasty, as well as long and narrow, which means they require maintenance by hand, making them somewhat unusual for the area. The course also features a good deal of mounding, landscaped with Jackpot Bermuda and other native grasses, which provides a sharp contrast to the course. Large berms, ranging from 12-15 feet tall, encircle the entire course, and tropical grasses await shots that find the low-lying runoff areas. There's also a 4.5-acre, man-made lake at the heart of the course that comes into play on several holes, including No. 18, which is said to be one of the best finishing holes to be found. The course also features large California-style greens, which are extremely smooth, lively, and unusual for West Texas golf. The greens are also typically guarded by small but very deep bunkers. The fringe is also mowed very tightly, which makes bump-and-run shots a good play on many holes, but also allows chip shots or putts struck too aggressively to roll off the putting surface. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,207 yards from the tips, and Doak even took the legendary West Texas winds into consideration when laying out the course, with some of the harder holes playing into the prevailing southerly wind. Those winds can change in a heartbeat, however, adding to the test of golfing skills the Rawls Course provides. Since its opening, the Rawls Course has received a good deal of notoriety and acclaim. Golfweek magazine ranked it #3 among all university-owned golf courses in the country, placing it ahead of even the Ohio State University Golf Club, which hosted the 2002 NCAA Men's Golf Championship. Practice facilities at the course include a 60-acre driving range, as well as a short-game practice area. The course also boasts a resort-style clubhouse which is home to Jerry's restaurant."

"The Texas Zoo","Texas","The Texas Zoo - Victoria, Texas - small public zoo with 150 animals on 6 acres","The Texas Zoo originated in 1957 when a benefactor contributed a lioness to the Mayor of Victoria. The mayor approached the Lions Club and began the long process of creating a zoo for the city. Over the years, the zoo grew from a single lion in a cage to a small children's zoo to a full-fledged zoo housing over 200 animals. In 1968, the zoo opened a new exhibit, the Animal Kingdom Building, which held over 200 animals of 85 different species. In 1976, the Animal Kingdom Building was rehabilitated and re-opened. The new exhibit included ten naturalized habitats for the animals that were then housed at the zoo. By 1983, the zoo board made the difficult decision to narrow the scope of the zoo and display only animals indigenous to Texas. The decision resulted in a tightly focused zoo that offers high quality care to all the animals currently in residence. Today, the Texas Zoo is sited on 6 acres in Riverside Park. It houses 150 animals that are native to the state of Texas in outdoor areas enclosed by moats. The zoo exhibits a variety of indigenous animals in completely natural habitats. In addition, the Texas Animal Kingdom Building houses a variety of birds and reptiles indigenous to Texas. The ten natural habitats encompass the many environments of Texas from humid marshlands to mountainous desert. Animals live in the habitat to which they are most suited, including alligators in the swamplands, pelicans along the coast and black bears in the forested mountains. The Texas Zoo exhibits 23 of the state's 138 indigenous mammals, including two rare cat species, margays and jaguarundis. The Zoo also houses 23 of the 540 bird species indigenous to Texas, including golden and bald eagles, brown pelicans and roseate spoonbills. In addition, the Zoo houses 35 of the state's 225 reptile and amphibian species, most of them located in the Animal Kingdom Building. Other animals found at the Texas Zoo include armadillo, river otters, prairie dogs and many varieties of snakes. The Zoo is part of conservation efforts in captive breeding and is one of few zoos in the country that house a breeding pair of Red Wolves, which are near to extinction in the wild. The Zoo also houses other endangered species, including ocelots and coati in addition to bald eagles, margays and jaguarondi. The Texas Zoo is available for special events, including weddings and birthday parties, as well as for group tours by arrangement.

"The Tremont House","Texas","The Tremont House, Galveston, Texas","The Tremont House is a Wyndham Hotel of significant historical value. The original structure of the Tremont House was built in 1839 as place to stop in Galveston, Texas for many people around the globe. Victorian ladies and gentlemen would come to the grand balls, soldiers spent homecomings at the hotel eating banquets, and others made public speeches. Names like General Sam Houston, Ulysses Grant, Edwin Booth, Anna Pavlova, Clara Barton, and Buffalo Bill can be found in the old hotel's registry. The hotel had to be rebuilt in 1872 due to a fire that hit Galveston's Strand District. The fire actually occurred in 1865, but it took seven years for the hotel to be rebuilt. In 1940 the Tremont House was closed; however, in 1985 the hotel was reborn to the glory one can see today. The new Tremont House is a half a block from the very first structure. The hotel was created in the image of the old one with a few additions. The original house from 1872 was demolished when the economy tanked due to the depression and the following war. Today the hotel is made of brick running along a couple of city blocks. Stone arches over the old fashioned windows and a period awning stand over the entrance. Visitors can arrive in style at the hotel by taking a horse and carriage ride through the Strand District. The interior of the hotel is just as grand as the exterior.

"The Tribute Golf Club","Texas","The Tribute Golf Club, The Colony, Texas - a Links-Style Golf Course That Simulates and Pays Tribute to Where the Game Began","The Tribute Golf Club is located in Texas, which seems about as far from the birthplace of golf in the British Isles as one could get, culturally speaking. The Tribute Golf Club is a tribute to the great courses on the other side of the Atlantic, however, and, according to reviewers, has done a splendid job of it. For golfers who have dreamed of playing the likes of St. Andrews, Carnoustie and Troon, The Tribute recreates the experience of Scottish links-style golf in the greater Dallas area. The Tribute is a true links-style course, designed by Tripp Davis, and patterned after those legendary courses, simulating some of the most famous and challenging holes found there. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2000, plays to 7,002 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.2 and a slope rating of 122. The course features wind-swept dunes, challenging water hazards and pot bunkers, as well as sea-washed grasses. And, since wind is fairly common in the Dallas area, the course simulates that as well, although the Texas heat often makes for a sharp contrast to the climate of Scotland. In simulating the Old Course at St. Andrews Golf Club, considered the birthplace of golf, the first and 18th holes share the same fairway, so there's not much of an excuse for missing this wide, wide landing area on either hole. On the surface, the first hole looks harmless enough, but the Swilken Burn is a small stream that cuts in front of the green and has been known to drown many a golf ball, while the green is undulating and tricky. Hole No. 2 of The Tribute takes golfers next to Carnoustie, which is considered one of the toughest and most demanding courses in Scotland. Just recall Frenchman Jean Van de Velde's meltdown on the final hole that squandered a three-shot lead in the 1999 Open. This par-4 hole is a tribute that simulates No. 5 at Carnoustie, considered one of the best on that course. There are pot bunkers in the fairway, a burn that runs across the fairway midway to the green, and plenty of heather, brae and gorse to either side of the short grass. In addition, The Tribute also features holes that were inspired by the famous Postage Stamp hole at Turnberry, as well as holes from courses such as Prestwick, Muirfield, Western Gailes, and Royal Dornoch. And, of course, the famous Road Hole and the Valley of Sin found on the St. Andrews Old Course. Since opening, The Tribute has received a number of honors and awards. Golf Digest ranked The Tribute as the #1 Public Golf Course in the Dallas area, and one of America's 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Tribute also features a 33,000-square-foot clubhouse designed as an English Tudor filled with Olde World d,cor and charm. Avid Golfer Magazine named it Best Clubhouse in 2002, and the clubhouse is home to a pro shop, 80 Guest Suites, and a restaurant with an award-winning European chef."

The Woodlands was a planned community of Montgomery and Harris counties, founded by George Mitchell in 1974. Mitchell had originally hoped to have The Woodlands annexed into Houston, but residents of The Woodlands disagreed with this idea.

"Uptown Neighborhood in Dallas","Texas","Uptown Neighborhood in Dallas","Uptown neighborhood is an area located in the north portion of downtown Dallas. The neighborhood is an upscale portion of the city that is full of restaurants, shopping, bars, and spas but it was not originally intended to be an upper-class area of the city. The Uptown neighborhood was originally home to the disenfranchised people in Dallas. Hispanic immigrants and freed African American slaves first established the neighborhood and named Uptown Little Mexico and Freedmen's Town. The African and Hispanic historical roots of the area have been erased with the exception of a massive grave site called Freedman's Cemetery that is buried under an expressway. The area is bordered by Central Expressway, Turtle Creek Boulevard, and Blackburn Street. Today, the Uptown neighborhood is one of the most upscale and walkable areas in the city of Dallas. A dramatic overhaul in the urban planning of the area has transformed it into an urban oasis of numerous entertainment establishments that is set in gorgeous architecture. The transformation took thirty years. Uptown is divided into three areas; State Thomas, West Village, and Knox Park.  The Uptown neighborhood is also considered to be part of the Oak Lawn community. Uptown is now considered one of the most desirable places to live in Dallas. Because the area is so walkable, cars are not necessary for locals or tourists in the area. There is an effective transportation system called DART which serves the Uptown neighborhood extensively. DART stands for Dallas Area Rapid Transit. The transit provides buses and light rail service in the Uptown area. An alternative transportation method is the McKinney Avenue Trolley which runs from downtown Dallas through Uptown and a portion of West Village. The area is very safe for individuals who prefer to walk, jog, or bike to the different shops and restaurants in Uptown. A business community called the Uptown Dallas Association promotes tourism in Uptown Dallas. The organization makes an effort to bring in revenue to the area. Various events that are held in the Uptown area are promoted through the Association's website. In many areas of Uptown, visitors can enjoy dining outdoors on the patio of a cafe, or even spend the evening dining at an upscale restaurant. Art galleries and the theatre bring an artistic aspect to the neighborhood and serve to culturally enlighten the locals. Places like the Magnolia Theatre (located in Uptown) have a broad selection of independent films. The Uptown theatre creates some diversity in the entertainment offered in the area. The Uptown neighborhood consists of an architectural mixture of old and new buildings. There are old and preserved brick buildings situated between glistening high-rises and commercial buildings.

"West End Historic District in Dallas","Texas","West End Historic District in Dallas","The West End Historic District was voted number one for the most walkable neighborhood in Dallas. It is buzzing with liveliness and entertainment all week long. Shopping is a very permanent fixture in the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood. There is a multi-story shopping center in the neighborhood called the West End Marketplace. Jewelry, clothing, and gifts are all part of the popular West End Marketplace. Places like the Dallas World Aquarium, Pioneer Plaza, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial, John Neely Bryan Cabin, and the American Museum of the Miniature Arts are all parts of the West End Historic District. Arguably, the most beautiful building in the West End Historic District is the Old Red Courthouse. It is a gorgeous architectural masterpiece located on the Dallas County Historic Plaza. The Romanesque Revival style building was built in the late 1800's and was fully restored in 2007. The building is constructed of red sandstone and blue granite. The amazing building is considered a Texas historic landmark and visitors can attend theatre presentations in the building that document the four eras of Dallas County history. Another building of note in the West End Historic District is the American Museum of the Miniature Arts. It is a museum dedicated to tiny figurines. The exhibits throughout the museum detail miniature homes that would have been created in the 1690's and inches it's way up to the architecture of the twentieth century. Besides the prominent buildings, beautiful landscaping, and entertainment attractions, the West End Historic District is a place bubbling with history, education, laughter and good food. The West End Historic District definitely has some great points, but it isn't all fun and glory. There are flaws to the district, but nothing that cannot be rectified with effective planning. For example, parking in the district is tight because of the growing popularity of the area. People get out of their cars and walk to the restaurants and shops, but often find they have nowhere to park their cars to walk to the shops and restaurants. Another parking problem takes place during a festival called the Taste of Dallas that takes place every summer. During the Taste of Dallas festival, different restaurants from all over the city offer small tastes of cuisine from their menu, free cooking classes, and great music and performances. It is a traditional city event that draws lots of local residents from in and around the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. Once visitors enter the Taste of Dallas festival, they pay around $20 for a certain amount of coupons that can be redeemed at booths for food and beverages. The popularity of the district has decreased over the years. Some locals have complained of pan-handlers and homeless people making their way to the district to seek help from the middle and upper class residents who frequent the area to shop.

"West Village neighborhood in Dallas","Texas","West Village neighborhood in Dallas","In the West Village neighborhood, bustling cafes, lounges, and restaurants spill onto the streets. There are gorgeous roads and sidewalks lined with trees and classic American architecture. The architecture and outside cafes that are located in the area are meant to provoke a European ambiance. West Village is constantly evolving and becoming one of the most walkable districts in Dallas for shopping, dining, and general entertainment. The West Village developers market the area as being like Soho in New York or Chestnut in San Francisco, but West Village is different. There are areas of the Village that are well planned and offer excellent amenities but the area lacks the character of a Soho or Chestnut. Downtown Dallas in and of itself does not have an urban shopping center where residents from all over the city come to purchase items. Instead, the city has various villages and districts for residents and tourists who want to shop, eat, or be entertained. The West Village neighborhood is one of those places where people can do all three. Residents of West Village are easily connected to the arts, culture, and surrounding entertainment districts in Dallas which is why many of them call the area home. The West Village has an urban and creative edge that keeps crowds of people flowing into the area all year long. The McKinney Trolley also runs through the West Village creating easy access to the neighborhood by public transport. The neighborhood attracts upper-middle class residents who desire to live in a walkable, upscale, and clean environment close to the downtown area, however, people from all over the city of Dallas enjoy the West Village neighborhood. The area is considered one of the safest in Dallas due to the constant activity at all times of day and night. West Village is crowded with dozens of places to shop like Sunglass Hut, Tommy Bahama, Ann Taylor Loft, Banana Republic, Gap, Brooks Brothers, and many more. West Village shoppers can find clothing, accessories, perfume, home accents, electronics, and books all within walking distance. Just over a dozen dining options are available in the West Village; Crue Wine Bar, Mi Concina, Tom Tom Asian Grill, Taco Diner, The Fish, and The Village Burger Bar. Of course, no trendy neighborhood is complete without a local Starbucks. The West Village is most proud of The Magnolia which is a five-screen theatre that offers independent films that are not shown in any other theatres in Dallas. Big-screen mainstream movies are also shown at the theatre. Screenings from local filmmakers, festivals, and other events are held annually at The Magnolia. West Village is located between the intersection of McKinney and Lemmon avenues. It is the perfect location for urbanites and professionals who want an easy commute into downtown Dallas. The neighborhood is also located next to prestigious areas like the Art District, Turtle Creek, and the Katy Trail. The convenience of being located next to Katy Trail is a bonus for those who want to live in the city but have an open green space as an option to their lifestyle. Overall, West Village is a vibrant new neighborhood in Dallas with a lot to offer."

"White Rock Lake Park in Dallas","Texas","White Rock Lake Park in Dallas","White Rock Lake Park was initially formed in 1910 as a water supply for Dallas when severe droughts prompted the city officials to build an artificial reservoir. In 1914, the city supplied a nursery of trees beside the lake to implement a park system. By 1930, the White Rock Lake was approved as a public park by the Park Board of Dallas. White Rock Lake Park is now the ongoing project of an organization called For the Love of the Lake. The organization maintains the beauty of White Rock Lake Park by picking up litter and recyclables. They are also involved in gardening and restoration projects. The organization has raised over a million dollars and used the revenue to install various park amenities like trash receptacles, playgrounds, information marquees, and drinking fountains. The organization works relentlessly and tirelessly to make the White Rock Lake Park more beautiful and accessible to the Dallas public. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Association labeled White Rock Lake Park as an excellent place for fishing. Fisherman catch crappie, catfish, and large-mouth bass. The fish caught at the lake are safe for digestion because White Rock Lake has shown no evidence of pollution. A fishing license is necessary to fish at the lake but can be obtained through the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In order to maintain the health of the lake, swimming is not allowed. Bicycling is another favorite hobby of the thousands of people who go to the park on an annual basis. The bike trail is 9.3 miles long and makes a perfect loop around the lake. The park offers information for those who want to rent a bike from a rental place in close proximity to the park. White Rock Lake Park is used by the public for a variety of activities. Bicycling, fishing, boating, picnics, sporting games, and even weddings are all part of the activity that takes place there. One of the most interesting and ecologically friendly programs that was instituted by the For the Love of the Lake Organization is the Adopt-A-Shoreline Program. The program has run for twelve years and enables groups to adopt a small portion of the lake's shoreline with the promise that they will keep the area litter-free. Each month members who have adopted the shoreline show up at the park and clean their adopted area. Currently, over forty organizations actively participate in the Adopt-A-Shoreline program. Participants who come to clean the shoreline monthly are rewarded with a continental breakfast and bottled water before the spruce up begins. White Rock Lake Park in Dallas is also committed to reforestation and maintaining the natural beauty of the city of Dallas. In April of 2006, the park established The Celebration Tree Grove where people can honor and remember loved ones by donating to reforestation efforts heralded by the park. The grove is located in the northeast area of the park and new trees are placed there to surround the pathways. Donations of $1,000 or more are celebrated with a bronze plaque that is placed among the tree groves. The Celebration Tree Grove consists of an array of cypress, oak, elm, cherry, buckthorn, holly, and many other tree varieties. Volunteers who want to give back to White Rock Lake Park are always welcome to participate in the on going restoration, recycling, cleaning, and adoption efforts that are consistently taking place."
