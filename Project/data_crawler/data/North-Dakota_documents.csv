"Bully Pulpit Golf Course, Medora, North Dakota ? a Golf Course Designed in the Spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, in the Badlands of North Dakota","North-Dakota","Bully Pulpit Golf Course, Medora, North Dakota ? a Golf Course Designed in the Spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, in the Badlands of North Dakota","The term Bully Pulpit'' was used by President Theodore Roosevelt to describe the White House, a terrific platform from which he and other presidents could forcefully advocate an agenda. Bully Pulpit Golf Course sits upon its own platform'' at the edge of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park, amid the rugged, ragged mountains of the Badlands of North Dakota. The course is the design of world-renowned golf course architect Dr. Michael Hurdzan, and features holes that play in woodlands, meadows and follow the meandering Little Missouri River. On the back nine, several holes are carved from the rugged Badlands themselves and feature elevation changes of up to 200 feet to go along with the area's confounding canyon winds. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,166 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 75.4 and a slope rating of 133. The holes on the front nine are level for the most part, and flow along the Little Missouri River and through forests and wild grasses. Sully Creek also comes into play, making for a picturesque nine that also includes petrified chunks of wood and colorful buttes. The bunkers on the course are said to be especially challenging because of the deep grass that surrounds them. And the back nine adds even more challenge, as the course climbs into the buttes, crosses several bridges and adds some dramatic elevation changes and forced carries to the equation. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include No. 8, a par-3 that plays to 195 yards from the Black tees, but only 137 yards from the Whites. From the tee boxes nestled in a tunnel of smaller trees, golfers must contend with the sight of Davis Creek and the scrub, which tracks this hole from tee to green. On Hole No. 13, things start to get really interesting. This par-4 plays to only 318 yards from the back tees, tempting many golfers to go for the green. A creek crosses the hole right before the start of the fairway, and there are two landing areas from which to choose. Hitting to the lower fairway will shorten the hole, but it's narrow and guarded by trees right and bunkers left. The much larger fairway landing area is on the left, but regardless of ball position, approach shots must play to one of the most demanding green and bunker complexes on the course. Hole No. 15 is one of the most photographed and perhaps most terrifying par-3s in golf. If viewed from above, the green and tee boxes would be the only specs of green amid rugged sandstone-colored mountains and rugged foothills. The hole only plays to 134 yards from the White tees, but it's hit-the-green-or-nothing on this hole, where golfers may come to know the meaning of the term God's country.'' Since opening in 2004, the course has received its share of honors. That includes the distinction of being the first course in North Dakota to be named #1 in Golf Digest's annual rating of New Affordable Courses.'' The course features a driving range and a clubhouse with a pro shop where rental clubs are also available. Sandwiches, snacks and drinks are also available at the Sagebrush Grill."
"Chahinkapa Zoo in Wahpeton, North Dakota","North-Dakota","Chahinkapa Zoo in Wahpeton, North Dakota","The town of Wahpeton, North Dakota purchased an 18-acre parcel of land from the federal government in 1903. In 1933, the first Park Board was founded under the direction of R.J. Hughes, founder of Chahinkapa Park. At the time the Chahinkapa Zoo was also founded, with a very small number of animal displays. The zoo was relocated from its previous location during the 1960's, to the north end of Chahinkapa Park. Formed in 1974, the Chahinkapa Zoo Association developed a plan for making improvements and renovations to the facility. A five-year master plan was formed in 1984, and an emphasis was placed on the theme clean and green,'' which incorporated a broad base of community support. Dedicated in 1989, the Rodger Ehnstrom Nature Center is the hub of zoo education. In 1995, Chahinkapa Zoo was accredited by the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, which resulted because of a 1994 IMLS General Operating Grant. As of 2008, the facility is home to more than 200 animals, representing 70 species. The zoo is committed to providing its animals with clean and green natural habitats, aesthetically pleasing displays and enjoyable surroundings for visitors. Such animals featured at the zoo include fossa, otters, bison, monkeys, camels, grizzly bears, wallabies, gibbon apes, cougars, snow leopards, elk, llamas, gemsbok and Bengal Tigers. Grandpa's Little Zoo'', is the hands-on educational area for youngsters. Here children get to see, pet and interact with a wide array of farm animals such as goats, sheep and llamas. The zoo takes great pleasure in giving guests a memorable experience. Combining beautiful scenery with lush landscapes and unique displays and exhibits, visiting the petting zoo is an opportunity for a lovely day spent with family or friends.

"Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, North Dakota","North-Dakota","Dakota Zoo in Bismarck, North Dakota","The Dakota Zoo began on 67-acres of farmland owned by Mark and Betty Christianson, located on the northern edge of Bismarck, North Dakota. Originally the Christianson farm was operated as a kennel for the boarding of domestic animals such as cats, dogs and horses. At one point in time, the Christianson's raised mink for profit on the farm. Over time, people would bring sick and injured animals to the Christianson's for rehabilitation. The farm grew in popularity as people brought more and more animals in, eventually curiosity grew and groups started to visit the farm. With the help of the Marshall Bill Show, petitions were signed by 780 people and Mr. Christian took the petitions to the Bismarck Park Board to present his ideas about turning the farm into a zoo. The Bismarck Zoo was to be a fully functional, self-supporting facility that existed with no assistance required from the City of Bismarck. The case was presented to the Park Board in 1958, and the Park made available an 88-acre tract of land in Sertoma Park. The Bismarck Zoo officially opened its doors on July 3rd, 1961, with 75 mammals and 23 birds. More than 10,000 people visited the zoo in its first year of operation alone. Currently, the zoo welcomes approximately 100,000 visitors through the gates and has more than 125 species of birds and mammals. Membership at the Bismarck Zoo has grown to include 3,400 people. In the summer of 1987, the Zoo was challenged by the Bismarck Tribune to develop a plan which would outline an orderly and organized growth plan. After accepting the challenge, the zoo board drew up plans to make this happen. The plan is reviewed and updated on a consistent basis, with the last major redevelopment occurring in 2005. Beginning in 1988, the zoo began a major fundraiser to raise money for, Beyond the Bear Necessities'' campaign, which raised an estimated $1.2 million. As a result of the successful campaign, the zoo was able to add many exhibits such as the Bear Habitat, River Otter Exhibit and the Canine Exhibit and many other displays. In 1996, the zoo began another campaign, Discovery 2000: Turning Dollars into Sense,'' the goal of the campaign was to raise $1.5 million, to make other major improvements. Resulting exhibits include Moose, Mountain Goats, Mountain Lions, Bobcats, Lynx and the addition of a Discovery Zoo. Today, the Dakota Zoo remains both self sufficient and self supporting and raises money through admissions fees, concessions and animal sales, membership fees, the adopt an animal program and private donations. Since 1991, the zoo has maintained the highest standard of animal care and as a result is a member of the Association for Zoos and Aquariums. The Zoo is opened during the summer hours from 10 am until 7 pm, and during the winter hours from 1 pm until 5 pm, with zoo grounds closing at 5:30 pm."
"Hawktree Golf Club","North-Dakota","Hawktree Golf Club, Bismarck, North Dakota ? Ranked as the State's #1 Golf Course by Golf Digest from 2001-2004","Hawktree Golf Club is situated five miles north of Bismarck amid the native prairie lands, wetlands and woodlands of North Dakota and the nearby Missouri River and Burnt Creek, which meanders through the layout. There are also many natural hills and contours on the course, as well as some unexpected elevation changes and three lakes. There is actually a surprising amount of water on the course, with water a factor on 11 of the 18 holes. The course also features a bounty of wildlife, native grasses and a unique solution to the lack of white sand to be found in the state: bunkers filled with black coal sand slag, which tends to stay in place better beneath the frequent wind storms that race over the prairie. There are also some grand old oak trees on the course, as well as greenside waterfalls that make for an interesting contrast. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,085 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.6 and a slope rating of 135. The course, which was designed by James. J. Engh and opened in 1999, features an open, links-style design. With only 80 acres of irrigated grass turf, the course is a splash of green amid the native brown and rusty-red grasses that cover the nearby hills. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, a par-3 that plays to 164 yards from the back tees. The difficulty comes from the 80-foot elevation change to a green nestled amid hills. Hole No. 4 is a beauty that plays to 412 yards from the back tees. As the hole nears the green, it curves left around a lake, then plays to a large, long, crested green guarded by a black sand bunker. Hole No. 7 is another visually stunning and challenging hole, a par-5 that plays to 569 yards from the longest tees. This hole's fairway plays along water that stops abruptly against a sandy-white brick barrier wall, bordered by a long black sand waste bunker. Nearer the green, there's another water hazard again rimmed by the course's distinctive black coal sand. Perhaps the most scenic hole, as well as one of the most intimidating, is No. 15, a par-3 that plays to a lengthy 203 yards from the back tees. There's a carry over a long pond, which has a fountain spraying at its center, to a very long, narrow green. Perhaps the most challenging hole is the finishing hole, a long par-5 that plays up to 588 yards. What makes this hole especially challenging is the final 150 yards, which play uphill to a smallish green guarded by black sand. And, if the prairie winds happen to be blowing inward that day, the hole is even more difficult. Since opening in 1999, Hawktree has garnered a number of honors and awards, including being ranked as the state's #1 golf course by Golf Digest from 2001 to 2004. That same publication also ranked Hawktree #19 among America's Greatest Public Courses in 2004. Practice facilities at the course include a 17-acre, two-sided driving range, a generous putting green, and a chipping green with a black slag bunker. Instruction is also available from the on-staff PGA professional. There's also a clubhouse with a fully stocked golf shop. KH SCH YU"
"Minot Country Club","North-Dakota","Minot Country Club, Minot, North Dakota ? a Classic Woodlands Golf Course Opened in 1929","The Minot Country Club dates back to 1929 when the course opened, and is a classic northwoods layout designed by Tom Vardon. Minot Country Club is primarily a woodlands course, with mature hardwoods and 50-foot evergreens lining its fairways, with water coming into play on only a couple holes. The semi-private course is relatively flat and is said to be very well-maintained. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to only 6,586 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 71.2 and a slope rate of 124 on Bluegrass fairways and Bent grass greens. Along with some narrow fairways, the greens are perhaps the biggest challenge on this course. They're small, fast and hard to hit in regulation. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 3, a par-4 that plays to 413 yards from the back tees and ranks as the #1 handicap hole on the course. This dogleg right is fairly typical of the challenges at Minot Country Club, where trees are the primary hazard. A tee shot to the left is called for on this hole, followed by an approach shot to a narrow green guarded by a greenside bunker that can capture shots that miss left. Hole No. 7 is the signature hole at Minot Country Club. This par-3 plays to 203 yards from the longest tees, and features a tiny green that's guarded by bunkers left and right. The green also slopes slightly from the back to the front, adding to the challenge of a well-placed tee shot. Hole No. 11 is a short par-4 and one of the few holes where water comes into play. The hole plays to only 389 yards from the back tees, but the water may intimidate some golfers, even though the forced carry is only 120 yards. From there it's another approach shot to a small, challenging green that features two hog backs, making it tough to score well on this hole. The finishing hole at Minot Country Club has been referred to by female golfers at the club as the hole from hell.'' The par-5 plays to 505 yards from the back tees and features a fairly wide fairway, but the challenge comes from the prevailing winds that tend to be blustery. A decision also follows on the second shot, which is to either lay up short of a gully or go for a small, two-tiered green in two. Any shots that miss long, right or left are typically in jail,'' hidden by the evergreens that surround the green. Minot Country Club has been highly rated over the years, including being rated the 3rd Best Public Course'' in the state by Golf Digest in 1996, and 5th best in 1997-98. Practice facilities at the club include a driving range with grass teeing area, as well as a short-game practice area with a green and sand bunker. The club also features a clubhouse with a pro shop, restaurant, snack bar and full bar."
"Roosevelt Park Zoo","North-Dakota","Roosevelt Park Zoo - Minot, North Dakota - small zoo with exotic animals and animals native to North Dakota","The Roosevelt Park Zoo started out in a small way with just one animal exhibit when it opened in 1920 - a bison from neighboring Montana. Since then, the zoo has steadily added animals to its collection, and today it boasts around 200 individual animals and birds. Over the years, the zoo's philosophy has remained the same - to provide quality family entertainment as well as educate people about conservation and wildlife and provide high quality exhibits and displays. The zoo has had an often eventful history during the almost 90 years that it has been in operation. During the 1950s and 60s, there simply was not enough money to spend on improving the zoo and conditions deteriorated. In 1969, the Minot area experienced its worst flood in almost 70 years - much of the zoo was under water for over a month and every animal and bird had to be temporarily moved to the local railway stockyards. And in early 2007, a fire virtually destroyed the Children's Zoo Barn; the entire structure had to be replaced. Although the Roosevelt Park Zoo is relatively small, it offers a wide variety of both birds and animals. Among the almost 100 species on display, there are some rare animals such as the Japanese serow, a type of antelope; and the amur leopard. Some of the more popular exhibits - especially with children - include the river otter and the African black-footed penguin. And of course, guests can see most of the more common zoo animals there as well - lions, tigers, apes, zebra and giraffes. The zoo has also acquired several new animals during the last few years. In 2002, the zoo acquired a couple of Siamang gibbons; the following year, great horned owls were added to the zoo's collection, along with a couple of baby giraffes. In 2005, West African crowned cranes were introduced for the first time, as well as a wild grizzly bear, and in 2007, Egyptian tortoises, trumpeter hornbills and a female mandible toucan all made their debut at the zoo. The Roosevelt Park Zoo also participates in two important conservation schemes - the Population Management Plan and the Species Survival Plan. Between them, these two programs have helped to ensure that certain endangered species thrive, through the careful use of captive bred programs. Some of the animals that the zoo has helped to protect include the Bengal tiger, snow leopard, the warthog and the oddly named Kirk's dik dik, a type of antelope. All of these animals can be seen today at Roosevelt Park. The Roosevelt Park Zoo has managed to both change with the times, as well as retain its charm and family-friendly atmosphere. Admission is inexpensive; the zoo also offers various membership packages for individuals and families, as well as educational tours and summer zoo camps. Guests can visit the zoo from May to October every year, weather permitting, with longer hours during the months of June and July. For more information, guests can call 701-857-4166."
"The Links of North Dakota","North-Dakota","The Links of North Dakota, Ray, North Dakota ? One of the Purest Examples of Links-Style Golf Built in the U.S","The Links of North Dakota golf course is said to be one of the purest examples of links-style golf to be built in the U.S. The course features a natural, rolling design that plays along the banks and bluffs overlooking the sprawling Lake Sakakawea in the heartlands of North Dakota. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,092 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.1 and a slope rating of 128. True to its links heritage, the course offers uneven lies and the sort of winds that typically challenge golfers on a links-style layout. The front nine holes offer some dramatic views of the lake, while the back nine holes feature a stunning Midwestern landscape with the lake in the distance. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 2, a par-4 that plays to 398 yards from the back tees. The challenge on this hole is finding the sliver of a fairway from a blind tee shot that plays over three bunkers that run in succession. From there, the approach shot must find a slightly elevated green guarded by four more bunkers. Hole No. 8 is a par-3 that plays to 185 yards from the back tees, and features a forced carry over a ragged gully. The green is guarded by three bunkers around its front and a slope that will likely carry anything short back into the ravine. Hole No. 13 is a short par-4 that plays much tougher than its 10 handicap might indicate. That's because it sports one of the narrowest fairways on the course. The tee shot must also carry the hill in the fairway in order to see the long, narrow green guarded by bunkers right and a gathering area on the left. Hole No. 17 is a lengthy par-3, that plays to 232 yards from the tips. This dramatic hole plays downhill, however, which makes it shorter, but it's all carry along a gully that runs to a green guarded by bunkers left and right. The finishing hole is the epitome of links golf, a par-5 that plays to 572 yards from the back tees. The crested fairway features an irregular shape, guarded by numerous bunkers as it doglegs rights to a green guarded by more bunkers. Since opening in 1994, the course is said to be considered the best in the state, and has garnered a number of honors and awards. Golf Digest awarded the course 4? Stars, and also ranked it #53 on its list of Top 100 Public Courses, while Golfweek ranked the course #90 on its list of Top 100 Modern Courses. Practice facilities at The Links of North Dakota include a grass driving range and short-game practice area. A range of lesson options is also available. The course also features a clubhouse with a fully stocked golf shop, and dining with a menu that includes a variety of sandwiches, snacks and beverages, including beer."
