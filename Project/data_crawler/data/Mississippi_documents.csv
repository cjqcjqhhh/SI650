"Beauvoir","Mississippi","Beauvoir, Biloxi, MS","Although Beauvoir eventually became the final home of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, it was not built for him. The house was originally built by a man named James Brown as a summer house for his wife and family. They called the home Orange Grove because of the many Satsuma orange trees on the property. The property stayed in the hands of the family until Mr. Brown's widow was forced to sell in 1873 for taxes due on the estate. A land speculator bought the home for the taxes, but sold it about three months later. A woman named Sarah Dorsey became the next owner of the home. She is credited with naming the house Beauvoir because of the beautiful view of the Mississippi Sound that she saw from her front porch. Jefferson Davis was looking for a place in the area in which he could write his books and called on the friend of the family, Sarah Dorsey. Mr. Davis explained what he was doing in the area and she invited him to stay on at Beauvoir. He paid fifty dollars a month for room and board. He lived there for two years before he discussed buying the property from Sarah Dorsey. A deal was struck for $5,500.00 to be paid in three installments. He made the first payment, but within six months Mrs. Dorsey had passed away. When her will was read he was the sole heir of her estate and the property became his. Jefferson Davis lived in the home until his death in 1889. At that time his daughter, Winnie, became the owner of the property. She died in 1898 and Varina, the widow of Jefferson Davis inherited the estate. Mrs. Davis eventually sold the estate to the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. She had two stipulations. The first was that the home be used for Confederate veterans and their widows without charge. This happened from 1903 until 1957 when the last three widows needed nursing home care. The second was that the property becomes the memorial to Jefferson Davis and the Confederate soldier. It has been run as such since 1903. Hurricane Katrina did significant damage to the structures and not all of the buildings on the property have been rebuilt or restored. However, there are plans to rebuild the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library and Museum. Beauvoir is now open three hundred and sixty three days a year from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm seven days a week. There are tours of Beauvoir House available and the admission is nine dollars for adults and five dollars for children. The Beauvoir House holds an annual Beauvoir Fall Muster in October.

"Canebrake Golf Club, Hattiesburg, Mississippi - An Upscale, Semi-Private Golf Course Ranked #3 in the State","Mississippi","Canebrake Golf Club, Hattiesburg, Mississippi - An Upscale, Semi-Private Golf Course Ranked #3 in the State","Canebrake Golf Club is a semi-private course that plays around a 250-acre lake and winds through more than four acres of native bamboo fields. Several of the fairways are tree-lined, but wetlands and water are the order of the day, as seven of the holes play around the lake. The course, which opened in 1998, is a Jerry Pate design and features undulating fairways and a lot more elevation changes than most other courses in the region. The course also features some typical Pate design elements, such as square tee boxes, oddly shaped bunkers and large, severely sloping greens. The Tifdwarf grass greens also tend to roll very fast and true. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to slightly more than 7,000 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 130 on Bermuda grass. From the White tees, the course plays nearly a thousand yards shorter at 6,031 yards. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, a hole said to be created by nature.'' This par-4 plays to a landing area bordered by a 50-acre nature preserve on the right, dictating a tee shot to the left. From there, approach shots play over a wetland to a picturesque green surrounded by pecan trees. Hole No. 16 is the signature hole for the course, a par-3 that can be a bit daunting at 243 yards from the back tees. From that tee box, golfers are on the other side of Milliken's Lake, while the more forward tees don't require a carry over water. Even so, this hole can be quite intimidating, as it curves around the water and the green is set on the lakeshore. The finishing hole may be the most difficult on the course. This par-4 plays to 464 yards from the back tees and is the longest on the course. While the hole plays straight, the challenge comes not only from its length, but from an elevated fairway that plays to a green guarded by two bunkers and more water on the right. Canebrake has hosted a number of tournaments over the years and received several honors and awards. Golf Digest ranked it #2 among the Best New Affordable course for 1999, and the course has also been rated the #3 golf course in the state. Practice facilities at Canebrake consist of a dual driving range considered the best in the area. The facility also features 6,700 square feet of putting and chipping greens, as well as two practices and bunkers. Lessons are also available from the staff PGA professional. One of the most impressive features at the course is its expansive clubhouse, which features a fully stocked golf shop. The clubhouse also features locker rooms, a full-service bar and lounge, as well as three restaurants for casual or fine dining.

"Farish Street Historical District","Mississippi","Farish Street Historical District, Jackson, MS","The street gets its name from the family that lived and had businesses for four generations. Until the late 1970's most of the businesses on Farish Street were owned and operated by black people. Farish was an early settler of the area. Segregation began in the 1890's and flourished as a business area. In 1915 it was well known as being the most progressive areas in the capitol city of Jackson, MS. Buildings on Farish Street were constructed by black craftsmen and the shops were located both on and off Farish Street. The business directory for Farish Street in 1913-1914 showed that the businesses include eleven black attorneys, four doctors, three dentists, two jewelers, two loan companies and a bank. The black population had two hospitals as well as numerous retail and service stores. In the early part of the twentieth century blacks made up forty percent of the population which is most likely why the businesses of Farish Street were so successful. There were two distinct cultures in Jackson during this time frame. Although there was some interaction on an economic basis between the two communities they didn't stray beyond it to social or religious activities. The famous photographer, Richard Beadle, had his studio for fifty five years on Farish Street. There were many churches, retail stores and restaurants that drew people to Farish Street in its heyday. The Ritz Theater is a landmark on Farish Street and it was one of only two black owned theaters in the entire country at the time. Jackson State University was located on the corner of Farish and Griffith Streets for about a year before moving to its new location.

"Grand Bear Golf Course","Mississippi","Grand Bear Golf Course, Saucier, Mississippi ? A Jack Nicklaus Signature Course Set Amid the Secluded DeSoto National Forest","The Grand Bear Golf Course is a Jack Nicklaus Signature design, which might conjure up images of very long, very difficult golf holes and an exhausting afternoon. But this course, which opened in 1999, was said to be designed by a nice Nicklaus.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course does, in fact, play to a lengthy 7,204 yards from the back Grizzly Bear'' tees, but it's been described as a not particularly difficult course, despite its USGA rating of 75.5 and slope rating of 143. The picturesque course is a bit off the beaten path, and even the driveway to the course is six miles long. That's because the course navigates through the towering pines and natural cypress wetlands found on a sprawling 650 acres of rolling land in the DeSoto National Forest. It's been said the golfers can play this course all day and not see a house or another soul, as the holes are well-spaced and often hidden by towering trees and marshland. For the most part, the Grand Bear has wide-open fairways, which speaks to Nicklaus' love of the golf courses of Scotland. And, even for those wayward shots that miss the ample fairways, the rough consists of packed pine needles which aren't very difficult to exit. Because of the course design, there are also many different angles that golfers can take to the green. One of the hazards that should be avoided, however, are the deep, signature Nicklaus bunkers, which again pay tribute to Scottish influence, and can be very difficult to escape. Another noteworthy hazard is the Biloxi River, and several of the holes wrap around it. There are difficult holes, of course, including Hole No. 5. This par-5 hole plays to a lengthy 603 yards from the tips, and features a tree-lined fairway that's one of the narrower on the course. There's also a creek that runs through the middle of the hole, and approach shots will find a landing area that slopes left-to-right. There's also a bunker on the right, but plenty of room to the left and back to bail out. Another noteworthy risk-reward hole is No. 17, which presents golfers with a challenge and a decision right from the tee: go for it and try to carry the rocky stream, or lay up short of it and make the next shot a longer play. As a testament to the championship quality of the course, the Grand Bear has hosted PGA events, such as the 2000 Shell's Wonderful Word of Golf, which featured a match between Jesper Parnevik and Paul Azinger. The Grand Bear also played host to John Daly's Make a Wish Tournament in 2004. Practice facilities at the course include a 400-yard driving range, along with putting green and chipping area. Lessons are also available. The course also features a 5,000-square-foot clubhouse, with a golf shop and bar & grill."

"Grand Village of the Natchez Indians","Mississippi","Grand Village of the Natchez Indians - Natchez, Mississippi - Large Site Featuring a Museum","Grand Village of the Natchez Indians is located at Jefferson Davis Boulevard in Natchez, Mississippi. Visitors can access the site by turning off U.S. Highway 61, known as Sergeant S. Prentiss Drive within the city limits, at Jefferson Davis Boulevard just south of the Natchez Regional Medical Center. Admission is free with visiting hours 9am to 5pm Monday to Saturday and 1.30pm to 5pm on Sunday, whilst group tours are available by appointment. The Natchez Indian culture began as early as 700 AD and lasted until the 1730's when the tribe was dispersed in a war with the French. The Natchez were successful farmers growing corn, beans and squash and they also hunted, fished and gathered wild plant foods to feed the tribes. During the French colonial period the Grand Village was the main ceremonial center of the Natchez Indians between 1682 and 1730, when they inhabited what is now southwest Mississippi. The Grand Village is a 128 acre site featuring a museum, a reconstructed Natchez Indian house and three ceremonial mounds. There is also a nature trail, a Touch Table for children and a Visitor Center with gift shop selling amongst other things Native American crafts. Throughout the year there are various public events and presentations at the site including storytelling, living history reenactments, a museum discovery week for children, a summer film series and the annual Natchez Powwow, which is usually held in late March and involves Native American dancing, food and crafts. The mounds served as bases for sacred buildings and were constructed by the tribe members. Two of the three mounds, the Great Sun's Mound and the Temple Mound, were excavated and rebuilt to their original shapes and sizes for visitors to now enjoy. The third mound, called the Abandoned Mound, has been only partially excavated and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History does not plan any further digging investigations. The museum exhibits both French and Native American artifacts and offers educational programs about the history, culture and archeology of the period when these two groups interacted together. These programs also focus on the French colonial experience and offer information brochures in English and French. Much of the knowledge of that period has been garnered from a wealth of colonial documents written by French priests, explorers, merchants, and military personnel. Another Indian site can be found in Natchez, which is called the Emerald Mound and it is one of the largest of its kind offering great views from the top. Visitors looking for something to eat nearby to the village will find several eateries within a couple of miles including BOBO Chinese & Seafood Buffet, South China Restaurant and Edna's Cake Creations, which are all less than a mile and a half away.

"Historic Natchez Cemetery","Mississippi","Historic Natchez Cemetery - Natchez, Mississippi - Historic Cemetery","Historic Natchez Cemetery is located at Cemetery Road in Natchez, Mississippi and overlooks the Mississippi River. It sits on 95 acres of land and was established in 1822 although the old burying ground was on a high hill in downtown Natchez. The cemetery is open from 7am to dusk, which is usually around 7pm and visitors are advised to leave by this time to avoid being locked in. The remains from the old burial ground were moved to its current location north of the town although Samuel Brooks, the first Mayor of Natchez who died in 1811 is still buried at the old site. In the old part of the city cemetery many notable people in the history of this city and state were buried. Gradually over a number of years in the mid to late 19th century the city bought new plots. The cemetery has many well designed iron fences, benches, iron mausoleum doors, tombstones and monuments with artistic sculptured markers and poignant inscriptions. Here the ironwork is a good representation of what was being produced in America in the 19th century and start of the 20th century. Most of the signed marble work dates back to before the Civil War with much of the sculpted monuments here are credited to Edwin Lyon and Robert Rawes, although other talented artisans produced work here too. Visitors are welcome to wander round the cemetery by themselves or they can take a guided tour. Anyone taking a self guided tour can either walk amongst the tombstones or drive along the roads in the cemetery and view it from the car, which may be more advisable in bad weather. Visitors can collect a booklet from the Natchez Visitor Center, which contains a reference map and provides a guide to the history of the cemetery and some of the most frequently visited tombstones. Private guided tours can also be arranged through Natchez Pilgrimage Tours or there is a special event called the Annual Angels on the Bluff Tour. This annual event occurs usually on the first weekend of November and includes local citizens and family descendants dressed in period costume portraying individuals buried here. The tours begin every 15 minutes for groups of approximately 30 people and have stories about the people buried here as well as musical tributes As parking spaces are limited here there is no public parking at the cemetery for individuals during the Angels on the Bluff Tour.

Situated on the old Longwood Plantation on the southern edge of town, the house opens throughout the week from 9am to 4.30pm. The house is approximately 120 miles from Jackson-Evers International Airport. The house was designed in 1859 by Samuel Sloan for a cotton planter by the name of Dr Haller Nutt, but due to the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 the work was stopped. The owner then died in 1864 and subsequently the home was never completed with only nine rooms on the basement floor of a projected 32 rooms finished. The house managed to survive years of neglect and is now owned and operated as a historic house museum by the Pilgrimage Garden Club, after it was handed to them by descendants of the Nutt family in 1970. This popular tourist attraction is probably most notable for being the largest octagonal house in the United States, but also features a Byzantine onion-shaped dome. It has been placed on the country's National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.

To add to the experience visitors are provided with a tour with guides telling the story of Haller Nutt and his wife Julia, how the construction was curtailed by the war and what the plans were for the unfinished part of the house, which is six stories high and 30,000 square feet.

Mr. Manship had fifteen children with his wife, Adaline, and in 1857 he built his cottage villa'' in the Greek revival style.

When the Manships celebrated their Golden Wedding anniversary ten of their children were still alive to help them. The Manship Home sits on a four acre lot in an area of Jackson that had few homes around it. There were only about three thousand residents in Jackson at the time. There are many native trees and shrubs that are still alive from when the Manship family lived at the home. Although Mr. Manship patterned the home from a design in a popular pattern book of the time he added touches to make it livable in a southern climate. The windows were floor to ceiling and he added a central hallway for adequate ventilation. Olive and cream are the original colors of the house and the shingles have been replicated for authenticity. Guests to Manship House Museum can see the parlor, sitting room, the dining room, three bedrooms and a most modern convenience for the time, a bathing chamber.

"Shearwater Pottery is a gallery and gift shop of pottery by the Anderson Family","Mississippi","Shearwater Pottery is a gallery and gift shop of pottery by the Anderson Family","Shearwater Pottery is located in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. At Shearwater Pottery visitors are able to view and purchase the thrown glazed ware that is created by Peter Anderson, his family and learn the story of their lives. Shearwater Pottery opened to the public over seventy five years ago as a family business with Annette McConnell Anderson providing the artistic input and George Walter Anderson providing the business input. Their sons, Peter, Walter and Mac also became artists and heavily involved in the success of the business. Shearwater Pottery was severely damaged in Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The centre has recently been rebuilt with a new showroom keeping the classic, rustic and beautiful natural settings of the original building. Visitors are able to purchase a memento from any one of the three generations of potters. Items for sale include mugs, lamps, bowls, vases and many other pieces of art created by an Anderson family member. The pottery is untouched by time and still run by the Anderson family. Visitors are able to wander through the majority of the shed. Members of the family are happy to stop and answer any questions that visitors may have. The Anderson's work is similar to that tough at Newcomb College with the classic shapes, yet they glaze their work differently and the Andersons believed that this is what sets their work apart from other potters. Peter created new glaze colors and gave them poetic names such as Blue Rain, Hyacinth, Grey Cloud, Desert Sage, Fall Green and Wisteria. Walter and Mac started to decorate pots and make figurines when they returned from college and then helped build the showroom that opened on the 19th January 1928. Less than ten years after opening the business pieces of art from Shearwater were displayed in Lord & Taylor and Strawbridge, Marshall Field in Chicago, art studios in New York and Philadelphia, at the Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston and have toured the United States with the Robineau exhibition. The pottery has often taken on a world of story, myth and sports, along with the flora and fauna of the Mississippi coast. The family uses scratching, cutting, carving and painting to decorate the pieces. The unique pairing of whimsy and epic colors and forms is what helps to create the greatest works at Shearwater."
"Shell Landing Golf Club","Mississippi","Shell Landing Golf Club, Gautier, Mississippi - A Davis Love III Signature Golf Course on Mississippi's Gulf Coast","The Shell Landing Golf Club is a Davis Love III Signature golf course located on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. The course is a scenic showcase of the diverse topography and nature of the area, wrapping around and playing through wetlands, bayous, marshes, rolling hills, and pine savannah. There's even a Gopher Turtle wildlife refuge before Hole No. 6, and birds are said to be heard everywhere on the course. The 18-hole, par-72 championship course plays to 7,024 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.2 and a slope rating of 128. Those are somewhat modest numbers for a course of this caliber, and it's been said that Love designed the course as much for the average golfer as the fellow big boys'' from the PGA Tour. The course, which opened for play in 2000, has especially wide fairways that appeal to the recreational golfer. The fairways are tree-lined and water comes into play on eight of the 18 holes, but from the forward tees the angle of approach to the fairways is less severe. The greens are also especially large, averaging a massive 12,000 square feet. They play fast, however, and tend to be undulating with lots of curves and swerves, making putting one of the biggest challenges Love designed into this course. There are also 72 sand bunkers on the course, many of them with truly unique shapes, to guard the greens and thwart approach shots. There are some noteworthy and challenging holes, and No. 6 has been described as more of an adventure, rather than a golf hole.'' This par-4 is the toughest on the course, even though it plays to only 305 yards from the Hawksbill'' (White) tees. The challenge comes from club selection and accuracy to the two island'' landing areas, which are surrounded by marshland and water. The primary fairway landing area is wide, but there are some wicked bunkers to contend with. The challenge from the fairway is another carry over wetlands and hitting a green guarded by more marshland on three sides. Hole No. 16 is a difficult, s-shaped par-5 that plays to 559 yards from the tips, and features an undulating fairway. There's also a bunker just below the green that's so large in requires six rakes positioned around its edges. Hole No. 17 is the signature hole for the course, a par-3 that can be a bit daunting. The hole plays downhill from elevated tees, and only to 161 yards from the Whites. However, golfers are faced with a sea of marshland, brown grasses and a stream, calling for a forced carry to a large, undulating green guarded by three bunkers at the back. Since opening in 2000, Shell Landing has received much acclaim. Golf Digest named it one of America's Best New Courses in 2002, and the following year ranked it #5 among the country's Best New Upscale Public Courses. IP Casino Resort & Spa gave the course a 10'' and put it on its Platinum List. Shell Landing also features a 25-acre practice facility, along with a clubhouse and deck, locker rooms and pro shop. The clubhouse also features a full-service restaurant and bar."
"Ship Island","Mississippi","Ship Island, Biloxi, MS","Ship Island has been in existence since French explorers discovered it in 1699. The island has played an important part in the history of the Gulf Coast throughout the years. Many of the first colonists of the area landed at Ship Island thus earning it the same distinction as Plymouth Rock only on the Gulf Coast. The island had roles in the War of 1812 against the British and during the Civil War. Admiral David Farragut used the island for his base of operations when he captured the ports of New Orleans and Mobile. Ship Island was used as a POW camp for confederate soldiers during the Civil War as well as a base for the first black US combat units that fought in the Civil War, the 2nd Louisiana Native Guard Volunteers. The National Park Service provides tours and lectures about Fort Massachusetts March through the month of October. Visitors to Ship Island today are treated to the most beautiful beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. They can picnic, swim, boogie board, snorkel and explore the island at their leisure. The islands are included in the Gulf Islands National Seashore and are one of only five barrier islands in Mississippi. There are ferries that run tours of the island and they arrive at the four hundred foot pier which lies near the fort. Visitors can fish for local flounder, red drum, speckled trout and sheepshead or cast a net for mullet. There are also excellent opportunities to see many types of birds, hike the island paths and look for shells along the beach. Lucky guests of the island get to see pods of dolphin around the island or by the dock as they feed on mullet or menhaden. There are restrooms, fresh water showers, covered picnic areas, drinking water and a small snack bar for refreshments along the boardwalk. The heat along with the humidity is intense in the summer months so visitors should bring along sunscreen and drink plenty of fluids. Sunglasses and lightweight long sleeved shirts and pants are recommended to keep sunburn from occurring. The island doesn't have a lot of tree for shade so the sand is quite hot and shoes are recommended for walking on the boardwalk or beach. Visitors can rent beach chairs and umbrellas on the boardwalk. Passengers on the ferries can bring on board back packs, small coolers and beach bags. In the spring the ferry departs only if a minimum of fifteen tickets have been sold and the weather allows. The summer ferries run seven days a week weather permitting. They depart Gulfport Monday through Sunday from 9:00 am to 12:00 and depart Ship Island Monday through Sunday from 2:30 pm and 5:00 pm. Fall ferry schedules are the same as in the spring so check at the dock for availability on the day your party wishes to go.

"Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center","Mississippi","Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center, Jackson, MS","The first school for African-Americans opened in 1894 and it was named after Smith Robertson, a slave from Fayette, Alabama. Mr. Robertson was born in 1847 and moved to Jackson, MS after the Civil War. He became a barber and operated a very successful barber shop. Mr. Robertson was active in politics and was the first African-American Alderman in Jackson. The original wood structure that was the school house burned down in 1909 and was immediately replaced with the brick structure visitors can see today. The building received an enlargement in 1929 by an architectural firm and it remained a school until 1971. The school was closed in 1971 due to integration and was basically abandoned. There were many citizens that didn't want to see the building torn down so they petitioned to save the school. Dr. Jessie Mosley and Dr. Alferdteen Harrison were two of the citizens that were instrumental in saving the school building. Dr. Jessie Mosley became the museum's first director when it opened in 1984. Richard Wright, an acclaimed writer graduated from Smith Robertson in 1925. He is most well known for his books Native Son and Black Boy, his autobiography. The mission of the museum is to increase public awareness and understanding of the historical and cultural contributions of people from Africa. An exhibit entitled From Slavery to America depicts the years from 1670 to 1864 in the life of black Mississippians. It chronicles their struggles and achievements. The Hall of Fame showcases pioneers in the political world. Some of the prominent names include Robert Clark, the first African American to serve in the Mississippi Legislature, elected in 1967. Unita Blackwell was the first African American woman elected as mayor in a Mississippi City; Reuben Anderson became the first to serve on the Mississippi Supreme Court and the Honorable Harvey Johnson, Jr. who was the first African American mayor of a State capitol elected in 1997. Docents volunteer at the Smith Robertson Museum where they learn about art history, lead tours, assist in museum activities and perform the duties of ambassador for the museum.

"The Azaleas at Dancing Rabbit Golf Club","Mississippi","The Azaleas at Dancing Rabbit Golf Club, Philadelphia, Mississippi ? A Championship Golf Course and Showcase for the Grandeur of the Great Southern Woodlands","The Azaleas course is one of two championship golf courses found at the Dancing Rabbit Golf Club in Choctaw, Mississippi. The Azaleas opened in 1997, and is the product of the design team of Tom Fazio and Jerry Pate, and is said to be a showcase for the character and grandeur of the great Southern Woodlands. The 18-hole, par-72 Azaleas course plays to 7,128 yards from the Gold Tees, with a USGA rating of 74.4 and a slope rating of 135. From the Blue tees, the course plays to about 600 yards shorter at 6,537 yards. The course is nestled amid the towering pines and oak trees native to the region, and plays through the rolling hills of east central Mississippi. The course features manicured Mississippi Choice Bermuda tees, Tifway II Bermuda fairways and A4 Bentgrass greens. While the Oaks course is actually considered the more difficult of the two courses at Dancing Rabbit, the Azaleas has also hosted many professional tournaments. Some of the more noteworthy holes at the Azaleas include Hole No. 8, which is the #1 handicap hole on the course. This par-4 plays to 465 yards from the longest tees and has been called by GOLF Magazine one of the finest natural par fours in the nation.'' What makes this relatively straight hole so challenging is a fairway that falls off to the right, while being guarded by a large fairway bunker to the left. Stray just a little off the short grass and golfers will find trees overhanging the fairway, blocking approach shots to the green. Hole No. 9 which follows is no picnic either. Another par-4 that plays to 439 yards from the back tees, this is one of the more picturesque holes on the course. From the tee, golfers must carry the wetlands to a landing area guarded by a large fairway bunker on the right and a pond beside it. From there the approach shot plays to a tricky green guarded on the left by a long, meandering stream. Hole No. 17 has been called a magnificent risk-reward hole. This par-5 hole plays to 527 yards from the back tees, and features a fairway lined by trees and divided by a stream. The water hazard comes into play at just the right location to make golfers think twice about going for the green in two. The green is big, but narrow, and is said to be full of tricky putts. The Azaleas course has received its fair share of accolades since opening in 1997, and has been included in a number of golf magazine's Top 100 You Can Play lists. Golf & Travel magazine listed the Azaleas among the country's Top 100 Modern Courses, while Golf Digest ranked the course among America's 100 Greatest Public Courses. Practice facilities at the Dancing Rabbit Golf Club include a 40-tee driving range and short-game practice area. Lessons are also available. Right next door is the Silver Star Hotel & Casino and the Golden Moon Hotel & Casino, which collectively offer lodging, casino entertainment, and thirteen different restaurants on site for both casual and fine dining. Music and dancing are also found at the Starlight Lounge, and there's also a spa and salon relaxation center."

"U.S.S. Cairo Museum","Mississippi","U.S.S. Cairo Museum, Vicksburg, Mississippi - 19th Century Gunboat and Museum","U.S.S. Cairo Museum and the gunboat are located within the National Military Park in Vicksburg, Mississippi. The museum is open throughout the year from 8.30am to 5pm between October and March and 9.30am to 6pm for the rest of the year. It remains closed on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The U.S.S Cairo is an ironclad gunboat commissioned in 1862 to help the North regain control of the lower Mississippi River. With this gunboat and six others they hoped to split the Confederacy in two, but the U.S.S Cairo's life on the water was short lived when in December 1962 it was sunk by a Confederate torpedo in the Yazoo River, 13 miles North of Vicksburg. All of the crew survived but the Cairo became the first ship in history to be sunk by an electrically detonated torpedo. The ship was largely forgotten about for many years afterwards until three men; Edwin C. Bearss, Don Jacks and Warren Grabau discovered its whereabouts in 1956. The process of recovering the boat was very slow and laborious with a few well preserved artifacts being lifted out first. Alas the ship had to be cut in to three sections when it was lifted out at the end of 1964. The vessel wasn't properly restored and moved to its current site at the National Military Park until 1977 with the exhibit finally opened in 1985. Visitors can now see the gunboat and the many artifacts such as weapons, munitions, naval stores and personal items of the sailors along the tour road at the U.S.S Cairo Museum. The entrance of the museum displays the only known photograph of the gunboat at her commissioning in 1862. There are many weapons recovered from the ship displayed here including 19th century pistols, muskets, shotguns and ammunition for the 13 big canons used on board the gunboat. Some of the personal effects of the sailors remained intact over all that time with items such as shoes, belt buckles, shaving items and several ambrotypes on display at the museum. Visitors will also be able to see the various tools used to maintain the boat as well as medical equipment and various cooking utensils. Although the U.S.S Cairo had to undergo extensive restoration after it was lifted out of the river, visitors can still see how the boat would have looked back in 1862 with many parts successfully recovered. This includes the big guns and the two and half inch thick iron plating that enclosed the gun deck. The vessel's five fire tube boilers are among the oldest and best surviving examples of their type, whilst the capstan and paddlewheel can also be seen. The museum also has a six minute video on the sinking and salvaging of the U.S.S Cairo. More information can be found at the park's Visitor Center, which is open from 8am to 5pm throughout the year. Visitors should note that whilst pets are permitted in the park they are not allowed on the U.S.S Cairo exhibit."
"Vicksburg Battlefield Museum","Mississippi","Vicksburg Battlefield Museum, Vicksburg, Mississippi - Museum","Vicksburg Battlefield Museum is located at Frontage Road in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Visitors are initially welcomed by a large battleship emblazoned with the name of the museum at the entrance. One of the exhibits provides an overview of the battlefield by way of a 250 square foot model with 2,300 miniature soldiers. The model is made of foam and twigs with plastic soldiers hand painted by David Villere over a period of two days.The idea here is to give a much clearer understanding of the complexities of the military operations, which would be harder to appreciate actually walking around the battlefields at the neighboring National Military Park. The Vanishing Glory is a 30 minute film shown in a 65 foot theater telling the stories of the people involved in the 47 day siege at Vicksburg. The photos used in this presentation have been digitally restored and enhance the story of the people and how they dressed and dealt with the siege, including how many of them had to live in caves dining on just peas and rats. There are diaries and letters to provide a clear understanding of how people felt during this difficult period. The museum houses the world's largest collection of model gunboats from the Civil War as well as many other vessels from U.S military history. There are models of ships that fought on the Mississippi River during the Civil War, submarines, blockade runners, Confederate raiders, ironclads, tinclads, wooden gunboats, and hospital ships.

"Windsor Ruins, the ruins of the Windsor Mansion","Mississippi","Windsor Ruins, the ruins of the Windsor Mansion","The Windsor Ruins is located 12 miles southwest of Port Gibson on highway 552. Construction on the mansion began in 1859 and was completed in 1861. The house was lived in for only two weeks by the original owner Smith Coffee Daniell II. Daniel was born and raised in Mississippi by an Indian turned farmer and landowner. He was married with three children at the time of his passing only aged 34. It has been said that Mark Twain used to compare the house to a college due to the size of the house. Slave labor was used to build the house which was a large four storey home and furnished elaborately and with a wrought iron staircase. The house reflected Southern life at the time. Tanks were installed in the attic for supplying water to the interior baths. There were twenty five rooms, twenty five fireplaces, a basement that contained a school room, a dairy and supply rooms. A commissary and doctors office was located on the first floor of the house. The roof of the house was used to signal Confederate troops of Yankee advances. During the Civil War the house was used as a Union hospital and observation post. This is what saved the house from being burned by the Union troops. Windsor burned on February 17, 1890 during a house party when a guest left a lit cigar on the upper balcony. Only 23 of the 29, 45-foot columns remain of the grand home that supported the roof line. The wrought iron staircase is now part of the Alcorn State University. The ruins of Windsor have made cameos in several films such as Raintree County with Elizabeth Taylor. The columns of the house have appeared in the movie Ghosts of Mississippi. These columns are thirty fee high Corinthian columns are a reminder of the grand existence the Windsor House was."
