The whale watching facility is located in the historic heart of Gloucester. This town sits on the southern shore of a rocky layer called Cape Ann and is only a forty-five minutes north of the Boston area. Gloucester / Cape Ann is situated between two major whale feeding areas known as Stellwagen Bank and Jeffrey's Ledge. Both areas are home to numerous whales, dolphins and a variety of seabirds. Wildlife covers the area. 7 Seas offers a one-hour tour and a one and a half hour tour off the port of Gloucester. The tour starts at the dock in the heart of Gloucester's waterfront at Seven Seas Wharf on the banks of the Port of Ensenada. Here a 90-foot vessel U.S. Coast Guard certified privateer that was designed specifically for wide viewing is available for visitors.

Although Gloucester Harbor is one mile long and over two miles wide in some places, their appearance, to the southwest in combination with the shape of the calm sea port and ensures a short walk even for those who are not accustomed to life at sea. From these protected waters there are many attractions to explore that are not accessible from the coast. The port has an abundance of wildlife in the inner harbor, with swans, common eiders, double-crested cormorants, gulls, Bonaparte, Herring Gull, Great Black-backed Gulls and Ring-billed gulls, being the most common birds. Seals are also very common to see watching the fishing boats and hoping to find some left by the remains of fish. Dolphins can be seen throughout the spring and early winter months. Although White-sided dolphins are found in the area throughout the year, they are much more common in winter than in summer. Therefore, spring and fall whale watchers have a better chance of seeing that the people who go whale watching in July or August. Dress appropriately, but remember that 7 Seas Whale Watch is a nature trip in the North Atlantic to see animals in the wild. In April, May and early June warm clothing is necessary. Ocean temperatures are still very cold and the sea breeze can make it uncomfortable if not dressed appropriately. Even the gloves are a good idea. The best bet is to layer up."

"Assembly Square Marketplace","Massachusetts","Assembly Square Marketplace, Somerville, MA","Assembly Square Mall in Somerville, Massachusetts was placed on the dead mall listing in 2001. In 2005 the original mall structure was demolished and it seemed the end for the Assembly Square Mall. However, it was able to rally, and as of 2006 it has been reopened as Assembly Square Marketplace. Assembly Square Mall was demolished in 2005, but it actually took seven years from when the mall became mostly dead for it to be revamped. Up until 1997 the mall was fairly successful then a few new buildings seemed to kill it. After a long political debate it was decided new structures would be put in the old malls place. Eventually all the buildings were complete in 2006 and it was finally reopened. To start off the Assembly Square Mall was originally built in 1981 at the former Ford Motors Assembly Plant, hence the assembly'' in the mall name. The plant sat on the banks of the Mystic River. First National Supermarkets which became Stop and Shop moved into the mall, Jordan Mash was at the north end of the mall, and a Kmart Store anchored the south section. All told the mall was 340,000 square feet with a food court in the center. The food center did not open until the 90's. Also during the past decade Home Depot and Circuit City were added to the mall. They were satellite properties as an extension of the mall. Macy's took over Jordan Marsh in 1996, helping to bring their chain to the mall. Macy's and Kmart were not great stores to have near each other, with Macy's being a more expensive store and Kmart the most inexpensive. Still, Macy's felt the store was worth keeping open after the acquisition. This did not last long. By 1999 much of the mall was closing and it was definitely not keeping up. Gap, CVS and other popular store chains left and in its place were 19 junk'' stores. Six months after most of the stores left, Kmart decided to remodel their store in the hopes that it would help. During 2004 the mall was mostly empty, and then in 2005 the buildings were torn down, except for Kmart. About February 2005 building began on new buildings. The Assembly Square Marketplace that exists now is a stripe style mall rather than the larger one building mall with indoor retail places it used to be. The mall is set up with streets, outdoor store fronts, and blocks of buildings. The store area that was Macy's is now a Christmas Tree Shop and Staples. AC Moore, The Sports Authority, Bed Bath and Beyond, and TJ Maxx are all a part of the New Marketplace Mall. As with many strip malls the stores tend to open at 10 am daily and later on Sunday. The mall does have a few restaurant style places to eat, rather than a food court.

"Back Bay Neighborhood","Massachusetts","Back Bay Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Bay with one of the Best Shopping Malls in the Area","The neighborhood got its name because the area was once a wide release in the 19th century, literally the Back Bay in Boston. To the west of the Shawmut Peninsula, across the bay from Boston, a wide bay opened between Boston and Cambridge, with the Charles River to enter at the west. As with the entire New England coast, the bay was tidal, with water rising and falling several feet throughout the day. Culturally speaking, the Back Bay is known for being the home of the rich and upper middle class. It is best known for its expensive housing and shopping areas. Most stores are located in Newbury and Boylston Street, with the ends closer to the Boston Public Garden traditionally more expensive. Back Bay is full of luxury hotels including the Copley Plaza hotel, the Colonnade Hotel, The Westin Copley Place, Fairmont Copley Plaza, and the largest hotel in the city, the Boston Marriott Copley Place. The Mandarin Oriental, Boston, opened its doors in October 2008 with a house in the arcade area, and a number of luxury designer boutiques and restaurants.

"Basketball Hall of Fame","Massachusetts","Basketball Hall of Fame","  Springfield, Massachusetts is the third largest city in the state.  The city can boast a few claims to fame. One of the most well loved children's authors of all time, Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, was born there. It is also home to a fabulous art museum, the G.W. Vincent Smith Art Museum and the city has its own major league hockey team, the Springfield Falcons. But what draws the most visitors to the city of just under 150,000 people is the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. The significance of the location of the hall may be lost even to the most diehard basketball fans. Many do not know that Springfield is the place where basketball was born. The hall is named for Dr. James A. Naismith, the man who invented the game of basketball.  Naismith was a coach at Springfield College when he invented the game in 1891 . Few fans know how the game was invented. Naismith was simply looking for a sport that could be played indoors during the cold Massachusetts winters. The game has changed significantly in the last 107 years, but the primary goal - throwing a ball into tall basket - has remained the same . The Hall of Fame honors many more contributors to the game besides Naismith. There are 258 individuals who have been honored by their induction into the hall.  The year that the hall was established, 1959, there were 15 people inducted. These included players such as Charles D. Hyatt and George Mikan as well as coaches, referees and people who somehow contributed to the game of basketball. The original inductees include Naismith . While the Hall was established in 1959, there was not an actual building that fans could visit until 1968. Since that time, the Hall of Fame has undergone a major restoration project. In 2002, a $45 million dollar project was completed and a brand new building, located a short distance from the original Hall of Fame, was unveiled. The 80,000 square foot building includes many attractions, including a full-sized basketball court where fans can test out their skills . While a decidedly American sport, the inventor was Canadian.  In addition to the Basketball Hall of fame, Naismith is also honored in Canada. His hometown of Almonte is the site of the Naismith Museum and Hall of Fame. That museum is currently closed for renovations, but the Naismith Foundation, which operated the museum, continues to host annual events to honor the inventor of basketball ."

"Bay Village Neighborhood","Massachusetts","Bay Village Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Smallest and Least Known Neighborhood in all of Boston","Bay Village is the smallest and perhaps least known of all Boston neighborhoods, with a population of about 2,100 residents, most living in small brick row houses. The Massachusetts Turnpike is the southern boundary of the quarter, which coincides with the right of way of Boston and Worcester Railroad, and was established in the 1830s. Marginal Highway and Cortes Street are the surface roads that run along the Pike. Throughout the Pike to the southwest is the South End neighborhood; southeast of the Pike and Tremont Street is the southern edge of Chinatown. To the west of Berkeley Street and north of Columbus Street (west of Arlington Street) is the Back Bay neighborhood. In North Stuart Street is Park Square, and east of Charles Street is the theater district. Bay Village is relatively quiet due to limited automobile traffic. There is a non-grid agreement and one-way street arrangement that makes the residential streets on the interior peaceful. Traditionally there were exclusively average lower-middle class residing here, but the neighborhood has become relatively expensive and luxury from around the 1990s. The western part of the neighborhood was originally part of the body of water known as the Back Bay, west of the isthmus of the neck of Boston. This area was once known as South Bay, in the original waterline was in the area of Arlington Street (formerly Fernando Street). In the 1820s, the neighborhood was full of land by developer Ephraim Marsh before landfill mass of Back Bay and South End neighborhoods. Throughout its history, the neighborhood has been known at different times as the Church Street District, South Cove and Kerry Village. Architecturally, the Bay of many village homes seems smaller versions of Beacon Hill homes. This is largely because many of the craftsmen who built the Beacon Hill residences were established in this area and built local residences for their own use.

"Beacon Hill Neighborhood","Massachusetts","Beacon Hill Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Quaint and Desirable Neighborhood Rich in History and Uniqueness","Beacon Hill is a historic part of Boston, Massachusetts, which along with neighboring Back Bay is home to around 26,000 people. It is a terraced house federal-style and is known for its narrow streets, gas lighting and brick sidewalks. Today, Beacon Hill is considered one of the most desirable and expensive areas of Boston. The Beacon Hill area is located just north of Boston Common and Public Garden in Boston and is limited generally to the south by Beacon Street, Somerset Street in the east, Cambridge Street and Storrow Drive north along the banks of Charles River Esplanade to the west. The block bounded by Beacon, Tremont and Park Street is also included, as is the Boston Common itself. The level section of the west side of Charles Street, in landfills, is known locally as the flat of the hill.'' Because the Massachusetts State House is located in a prominent place in the top of the hill, the term Beacon Hill is also often used as a metonymy in the local media to refer to the state government or the legislature. Like many similarly named areas, the neighborhood is named after the location of an old lighthouse atop the highest point in central Boston, once located just behind the current site of the Massachusetts State House. The hill, and two other nearby hills, was substantially reduced in height to allow housing development in the area and use the land to create land by filling the Mill Pond in the northeast. The whole hill was once owned by William Blaxton, the first European settler of Boston, from 1625 to 1635, he sold his land to the Puritans. The south slope of Beacon Hill, facing the common was socially desirable side in the 19th century. Black Beacon Hill was on the northern slope. The two hills were largely united on the subject of abolition. Beacon Hill was one of the first centers of the movement against slavery in the antebellum era. In 1937, the Late George Apley, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, gave a satirical description of the upper class white residents of Beacon Hill. Until a major project of urban renewal in the 1950s, the red district of Scollay Square bloomed just east of Beacon Hill, like the West End neighborhood to the north. Beacon Hill was declared a National Historic Landmark on 19 December 1962. Many sites of interest are located in the neighborhood including Suffolk University, Park Street Church, and the Francis Parkman House. The Bull and Finch Bar on Beacon Street is located in the area and was the inspirational source behind the exterior shots of the Cheers television show. There are several museums in the area including the Museum of African American History which is New England's largest museum that is dedicated to the contribution of African American exhibitions.

"Boston Common: Rural Oasis in the Heart of the Big City of Boston Massachusetts","Massachusetts","Boston Common: Rural Oasis in the Heart of the Big City of Boston Massachusetts","In the center of the city of Boston lies the oldest public park in the history of the United States. The nearly 50-acre Boston Common was established in 1634, initially for common pasture land. It was also the site of public hangings and was used for military purposes. During the war for independence it was the site of the British troop encampment prior to their departure in April of 1775 to the renowned battle of Lexington and Concord. Monuments to the War for Independence and dozens of other landmarks fill the downtown area and the park itself. The Visitor's Center in Boston Common is the departure point to see those sites along the Freedom Trail, which many a visitor and most Bostonians have embarked upon at least once. In past decades this park has served as the site of a diversity of major public speakers including Gloria Steinem, Martin Luther King Jr., and Pope John Paul II. It has also been the site for Boston activists to organize public demonstrations and protests throughout the last 100 years. Since March of 2008, debate has begun around limiting the number of large events allowed to occur in the park in order to limit the impact on the ecosystem and the parks natural beauty. It is the hills of the Boston Common where city children sled in the winter and skate on the frozen frog pond.'' In hot months that same skating rink becomes a wading pool, with sprinkler jets that cool the kids, giving parents some quiet time in the midst of a family picnic. Like any major city park, the summer is a scene of concerts, rollerblading and biking as well as the best people watching that Boston can offer. Of course the gallows were removed and the grazing came to a halt in the first half of the 19th century, prior to the public park system being created as such. Indeed it was in 1850 when the idea for a public park system first emerged. At that time the Boston Common was the only such public space. Finally in 1867 a law for Boston parks was approved by the Massachusetts State Legislature. Several years went by before, between 1878 and 1896, the Emerald necklace was created, based on the plan of the leading landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The necklace, which is anchored by Boston Common and the neighboring Public Garden is a seven-mile semi-circle of interconnected green spaces throughout Boston. While many rural areas are only a short trip outside of the city, the Boston Common and surrounding parks take the edge off city-life and by providing an oasis in the heart of this urban center."
"Boston Duck Tours","Massachusetts","Boston Duck Tours - Massachusetts - Amphibious Jeep Tours for the Public","During the early days of World War II, the Allies faced a tough tactical problem: How to discharge the cargo and men from their ships in places where dock facilities had been destroyed or simply did not exist? The answer was to unload cargo directly onto the beach. The exigencies of war, along with the expertise and old fashioned Yankee ingenuity combined to create the perfect solution - a vehicle that was half boat and half truck that could run on land and water. Code-named: DUKW. The first duck was actually a GMC truck enclosed in a water-tight shell. It was not long before DUKWs played a crucial role in the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Pacific and the largest invasion of all, D-Day. In fact, over 40% of all beach supplies in Normandy were transported by DUKWs during the first four months. Boston Duck Tours operates a fleet of restored World War II DUKWs. These amphibious vehicles played an important role in both theaters of Europe and the Pacific war. The Boston Duck Tours and Museum of Science Boston have joined together to present the history of these remarkable vehicles. A special exhibit includes a history of the DUKW, photographs, vintage posters and films. General Motors built 21,000 DUKWs during the war. The display also includes a fully restored Seep. It looks like a miniature DUKW but is actually one of the 12,000 amphibious Jeeps built by Ford Motor Company during World War II. This special exhibit is located in the Science Museum, near the cockpit of Boston Duck Tours ticket. In recent years, Boston Duck Tours has begun to replace the original DUKWs with DUKWs that are easier to maintain and operate. The Boston Duck Tours fleet currently consists of original DUKWs that house 32 people with a new open air deck for the last 8 seats and DUKWs time guests are 36 and are completely closed. DUKWs currently have 15 original and 9 DUKWs at a time. The DUKW type you choose depends on the size of your group and timing of your trip. The Duck Tours has three convenient points of departure including the Museum of Science at 1 Science Park, the Prudential Center in Boston's Back Bay at 53 Huntington Avenue, and the New England Aquarium at 1 Central Wharf. Operating season runs from March 23 through November 29 each year. The tour runs on each weekend throughout December as well. The tours from the Prudential Center and the Museum of Science operate seven days a week rain or shine. Weather does not prevent the tours from these locations from happening. Each tour is approximately 80 minutes when departing from the Prudential Center or Museum of Science and 55 minutes when departing from the New England Aquarium. The tours begin at 9:00 am and the last tour from the Museum of Science and Prudential Center leaves an hour before sunset. Tours leave every 30 or 60 minutes, depending upon the season."
"Boston Garden: The Only Name For World Class Sports And Events In Boston, Massachussetts","Massachusetts","Boston Garden: The Only Name For World Class Sports And Events In Boston, Massachussetts","The original Boston Garden opened its doors in November of 1928; it was constructed at a cost of 4 million dollars and had a capacity for 14,890 spectators. The first professional sports team to call the arena home was the Boston Bruins ice hockey team. For seventy years it would not only host thousands of regular season and championship games but also numerous civic and artistic events. Among the speakers that addressed a packed arena over the years were world leaders like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy. World class performing artists that played the Boston Garden included James Brown, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and scores of others. The Greatest Shows on Earth'' when in Boston, like the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Bailey Circus would be found at this indoor stadium. The most talked about legend of the Garden however, was the parquet floor on which the NBA team, the Boston Celtics, play. Said floor was installed in 1946 at the Boston Arena, with wood extracted from the forests of Tennessee by the Boston Lumber Company. The floor is said to have cost $11,000. At that time, the Celtics played their home games interchangeably at both the Boston Arena (which would later become the Matthews Arena) and the Boston Garden. In 1952 that floor was moved to the Boston Garden, which from that moment on became the exclusive home court of the Celtics until 1995, when the building was closed forever. The Celtics' parquet floor was the only part of the old structure however, that was moved to the new venue, initially named the Fleet Center. The Fleet Center opened on September 30, 1995, with a construction cost of 160 million dollars. It was built on 3.2-acres just nine inches away from the site of the original facility with a 19,580 capacity. In 1997 the old building was demolished. Over the years a myth had evolved around the Celtics frequent ability to compete for the championship based in the parquet floor. It was a said that the team could predict which way the ball would bounce off of any given section. But in late 1999 the last game was played on the old floor, (much of which, in reality, had been replaced over the years, one section at a time, due to damages from use.). On January 3, of 2000, a new floor was inaugurated beneath the treads of the team, although some sections of the old parquet floor have been recycled into this new floor, keeping this urban myth alive. The Parquet floor aside, the home team did have a distinct advantage in the original Boston Garden. The fans sat much closer to the players than in most stadiums as part of the design by boxing promoter Tex Rickard, who wanted the fans to see the sweat dripping off of two opponents in the ring. While this may have raised team morale for home players it almost surely hurt morale for visiting teams when the Boston fans got angry and were that much closer to the area of play. Despite that advantage, the old stadium had many problems like continuous electrical failures, no air conditioning and a non-regulation size hockey ring. The new facility was built to overcome the flaws in order to make fans even more comfortable at sporting events and other activities in a modern setting. Due to popular demand, by 2005 it was agreed to change the new buildings name to TD Banknorth Garden, which was immediately restored to Boston Garden by Bostonians. Today the Boston Garden continues to be home to the National Hockey League team of the Boston Bruins, the National Basket Ball Association team of the Boston Celtics and the National Lacrosse League team of the Boston Blazers. In addition to hosting major sports, music and entertainment events the multi-purpose arena already hosted a major political event, the 2004 Democratic National Convention. The facility received major upgrades only 10 years after it was built. In 2006, 20 million dollars were spent on, among other things, the construction of a 20,000 foot expansion of the North Station train concourse below the stadium and the installation of the first high definition scoreboard. With the local recognition and prestige of this name since 1928, any world class event in the City of Boston will continue to be held at the Boston Garden for the coming decades."

"Boston Public Garden","Massachusetts","Boston Public Garden - Massachusetts - Large Park in the Heart of Boston","The Public Garden, also known as the Boston Public Garden, is a large park in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts, near Boston Common. The Public Garden was established in 1837 when philanthropist Horace Gray asked for the use of land as the first public botanical garden in the United States. Gray helped to marshal political resistance to a number of Boston City Council is trying to sell the land in question, finally resolve the question of devoting the public garden in 1856. The Act establishing the land use was submitted to the voters on April 26, 1856 where it passed with only 99 dissents. Today the north side of the lake is a small island, but originally was a peninsula, connected to land. The site became so popular with fans of the John Galvin, the city forester, decided to cut the connection to the earth. The landscape of twenty-four hectares, which was once a marsh, was designed by George F. Meacham. The paths and flower beds were placed by the city engineer, James Slade and Forestry, John Galvin. The plan for the garden includes a series of fountains and statues. The first statue was erected by Edward Everett William Wetmore Story, in November 1867 in the northern part of the garden, near Beacon Street. The bronze statue of George Washington by Thomas Ball, which dominates the west side of the park, was dedicated on 3 July 1869. The firm suspension bridge in the middle of the lake was built in 1867. The public garden is run jointly between the Office of the Mayor, the Parks Department of the City of Boston, and friends of the non-profit public gardens. It was declared a National Historic Monument in 1987. Along with the Boston Common, these two parks form the northern terminus of the Emerald Necklace, a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. While the common open space is largely unstructured, the Public Garden contains a lake and a series of formal plantings that are maintained by the city and others, and vary from season to season. During the warmer seasons, the four acre pond is usually the home of one or more of the swans and is always the site of the Swan Boats, a famous tourist attraction in Boston. For a small fee, tourists can sit on a boat decorated with a white swan in the back. The boat is then pedaled around the lake by a tour guide sitting on the swan. The Public Garden is rectangular and is bounded on the south by Boylston Street, west of Arlington Street, and north of Beacon Street, where it faces Beacon Hill. On its east side, Charles Street divides the common public garden. The greenway that connects the public garden, with the rest of the Emerald Necklace is a strip of park that runs west through the center of Commonwealth Avenue to the marshes of Back Bay and the river of mud."

"Charlestown Neighborhood","Massachusetts","Charlestown Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Irish Influence that Still Exists Today","Charlestown is located north of Boston proper on a peninsula extending southeast between the Charles River and the Mystic River. The geographical extent of the area has changed drastically since its colonial ancestry. Landfill operations have expanded dramatically, from Boston, down mountains, and have expanded into Charlestown, eliminating the Charlestown narrow neck connecting the northwest tip of the peninsula of Charlestown to the mainland. The original territory included present Somerville, which was incorporated as a separate city in 1842, as well as the northern part of Arlington. At the time, Charlestown proper was urbanizing, while Somerville was still largely rural. Charlestown is a part of the city of Boston, Massachusetts, situated on a peninsula north of Boston proper. Charlestown was originally an independent city and the first capital of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, which later became a city in 1847 and was annexed by Boston on 5 January 1874. While there has been a major U.S. population influx from Ireland since the Irish emigration during the Irish famine of the 1840s, the neighborhood has changed substantially due to its proximity to the center of colonial architecture and City Square since the late 1980s. The Bridge and Old Bridge Warren, was formerly a stop on the high Charlestown. The central artery was built between 1951 and 1954, routing via ramps for lifting the Town Square. The Area of North Central Artery (CANA) of this project was moved underground tunnel in the city square, giving way to a revitalized surface fleet. Charlestown contains several historic sites, many of which are marked by the north end of Boston's Freedom Trail. The Freedom Trail ends at the Bunker Hill Monument commemorating the famous Battle of Bunker Hill. The USS Constitution, the oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, is docked in the Charlestown Naval Shipyard. Charlestown was also the place from which Paul Revere began his famous midnight ride before the battles of Lexington and Concord. A local restaurant called the Warren Tavern opened in 1780 and is still in operation. The Warren Tavern claims to have been one of Revere's favorite taverns. Throughout the 1960s until the mid-1990, Charlestown was infamous for its Irish mafia presence. The Charlestown McLaughlin Brothers were involved in a gang war with neighboring Somerville Winter Hill Gang during the wars of the Irish mob in the 1960s. In late 1980, however, Charlestown underwent a massive gentrification process similar to that of the South End. Attracted by its proximity to downtown and its colonial, red brick row house dwellings, similar to Beacon Hill, many professionals from the upper middle class, moved into the neighborhood. In late 1990, additional gentrification took place, similar to that in neighboring Somerville. Today the neighborhood is a mix of upper-middle and middle-class residences, housing projects and a large working class Irish-American population and culture that still dominates to this day."

"Chinatown Neighborhood","Massachusetts","Chinatown Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - The Most Densely Populated Neighborhood in Boston","Chinatown remains a center of Asian-American life in New England and hosts many Chinese restaurants, Japanese, Cambodia and Vietnam markets. Chinatown is one of the most densely populated residential districts in the Boston area, with a reported 28,000 people per square mile in the year 2000. Nearly 70% of the population is Asia's Chinatown, with an average household income of $14,289. The only historic Chinese site in New England is Chinatown and the area is located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. Focused on Beach Street, the neighborhood borders along Boston Common and Downtown Crossing. To the far south is Highway Southeast or Massachusetts Turnpike. Part of it occupies a floor space reclaimed by filling the tides or tidal flat and the newly built area was first settled by the Anglo-Bostonians. After residential properties in this area became less desirable due to the development of railways, which was settled by a mixed sequence of Ireland, the Jewish immigrants, Italian, Syrian, and Chinese. Each group replaces the former to take advantage of low cost housing and employment opportunities in the area. During the late nineteenth century, the manufacturing plants of clothing also moved to Chinatown, the garment creation of the historic district of Boston. The garment district was active until the 1990s. Negotiations culminated in the provision of funds for the construction of new housing in the Chinatown community. During this period, city officials also designated an area adjacent to Chinatown and Boston's red light district, also known as the combat zone. The traditional Chinatown Gate (paifang) with foo lion on each side is at the intersection of Beach Street and the road surface. The Gate is visible from the southern bus terminal and is a popular tourist destination and great photo opportunity. Chinatown offers excellent local and regional transport. It is served by the MBTA Red Line, Silver Line and Commuter Rail station in the south and the Orange Line station in Chinatown. Interstate 93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike are close behind. Two Chinese-owned bus services (Fung Wah and Lucky Star / Travel pack) provide hourly connections with New York's Chinatown. Tufts Medical Center overlooks part of the area and includes a full-service hospital and health facility associated with various schools including Tufts University, Tufts University School of Medicine, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. In addition, South Cove Community Health Center Chinatown Clinic operates at 885 Washington Avenue. South Cove volunteers founded it in 1972, to provide better health care for Asian Americans in the Chinatown area. In recent years, a new satellite Chinatown has been rapidly emerging approximately 10 miles south on Hancock Street in the nearby city of Quincy. This is due to the rapid influx of Hokkien-speaking mainland Chinese immigrants from Fujian Province and a large and growing population of Vietnamese origin. There are already several large Asian supermarkets, such as food and Man Kam Super 88 supermarket chains and other businesses that compete with Boston's Chinatown. Several companies operating in Chinatown now have branches in Quincy."

"East Boston Neighborhood","Massachusetts","East Boston Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Spectacular Skyline Views with Low Rental Prices","East Boston is a neighborhood that includes nearly 40,000 people as part of the city of Boston. The community was created by connecting several islands, using landfill and then was annexed by Boston in 1836. East Boston is separated from the rest of the city by Boston Harbor and bordered by Winthrop, Revere, Chelsea and the creek. Directly west of East Boston across Boston Harbor is the North End and Boston's financial district. The neighborhood has long provided a foothold for the latest wave of immigrants, Irish, Russian Jews and Italians and then alternating the predominant group. Today, immigrants from El Salvador, Brazil and elsewhere in Central and South America East Boston have made a center of Latino culture in New England. In East Boston, which some call EASTI the demographic has changed to predominantly Hispanic, and the once important Italian population still lives in areas such as Orient Heights. While East Boston has a spectacular view of the city skyline, the rental prices of the community and property values have risen more slowly than the extraordinary increase witnessed in the rest of the metropolitan area of Boston during the 1990s and early 2000. This slower growth can be attributed to factors such as the isolated nature of the neighborhood, difficulties of real estate development along the coast and the negative attitude towards the local Logan Airport East Boston residents. Sites in the neighborhood that are popular with tourists and locals are: Sanctuary of the Madonna and Don Orione - One of the most recognizable icons of East Boston is the 35-foot-high statue of the Virgin. The Madonna Shrine, atop Orient Heights, is the national headquarters of the Don Orione order. Built in 1954, the statue is a scale replica of the one at the Don Orione Center in the district of Monte Mario in Rome, Italy. It was built in 1954 by Jewish and Italian sculptor Arrigo Minerbi, who wanted to show his gratitude to the Catholic Church for having shielded him and his family from the Nazis during World War II. Across the street from the Shrine is the Don Orione Home, a nursing home, as the Sanctuary, was founded by the Don Orione priests. Suffolk Downs - Powered by Route 1 and a blue line stop, Suffolk Downs was opened in 1935 and the point considered modern, although it now seems dated. For years they have held a Grade II event at the track called the MassCap. More recently, the issue has complained that revenues have been drained as a result of Indian casinos in Rhode Island and Connecticut and have canceled the MassCap. On 18 August 1966, the Beatles played a concert before some 24,000 music fans in the box Suffolk Downs.

"Eastfield Mall","Massachusetts","Eastfield Mall, Springfield, MA","Eastfield Mall is credited with being one of the first indoor shopping centers in New England. The mall is in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was built in 1967 with three anchor stores. The anchor stores were on the mall location before the actual shopping center was built.

"Fenway Park","Massachusetts","Fenway Park - Boston, Massachusetts - More than just a Baseball Field","Fenway Park is a baseball park, near Kenmore Square in Boston, Massachusetts. Located at 4 Yawkey Way, the park has served as the home stadium of the club's baseball team, Boston Red Sox, since it opened in 1912 and is the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball currently in use. It is the only ballpark of the original standards that are still in use today. Due to the limited age and location of the park in an urban neighborhood next to the large campus of the University of Boston, the park has had many renovations and additions in recent years not originally planned for. This resulted in unique and peculiar architecture and landscape which was known as the Triangle , Pesky Pole and especially the famous Green Monster in left field. Fenway Park is known for hosting dedicated Red Sox fans, so-called Red Sox Nation. Every Red Sox home game since May 15, 2003, has been sold, in 2008; the park sold its 456th consecutive game the Red Sox, breaking a record in the majors. Fenway Park has also been the site of other sporting and cultural events, including professional football games for the Boston Redskins and the Boston Patriots, concerts and political campaigns. On 15 May 1999 then CEO of the Red Sox, John Harrington, announced plans for a new Fenway Park to be built near the existing structure. It should have the same dimensions in the field, are a green monster, basically a replica of the existing fleet, but was upgraded to replace some of the features of old Fenway Park. Some sections of the old Fenway Park would be preserved (mainly the original Green Monster and the third base side of the park) as part of the new overall design. Most of the old park would be demolished to make room for new development, with a section that is at the home of a baseball museum and a public park. This was a very controversial idea, as most fans consider Boston area sports Fenway Park to be sacred ground, and demolition of the old park that have caused significant distress. Various groups emerged, such as Save Fenway Park to try to block the move. All parties discussed for several years about the details of the new stadium. One plan even involved the construction of a Sports Megaplex in South Boston, where a new Fenway Park would be located next to a new stadium for the New England Patriots. The Patriots ultimately built a new stadium in Foxboro, and that the plan was abandoned. Even after several more rounds of discussions, the Red Sox could not reach an agreement with the city of Boston for a new stadium. In 2005, the group owning the Red Sox announced that the team would remain at the current Fenway Park indefinitely. Before the 2008 season, Fenway Park's capacity was increased to 39,928, where it remains for additional renovations following the 2009 season, Fenway representation as the smallest room, behind the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, Tropicana Field and PNC Park. Renewal before the 2009 season now allow the Sox to sell tickets for about 350 more each game, although the official capacity has not increased."

At least until 1675, the hill jutted out into the Atlantic Ocean, hence the designation of being a point.

"General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport - Boston MA General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport Flights","Massachusetts","General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport - Boston MA General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport Flights","The General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport's name isn't the only big thing about it. Logan, as it is called for short, is the biggest airport in New England. Busier than Atlanta and San Francisco, Logan serves as a focus city for several carriers and more than 26 million passengers cross through its 2400 acres each year. Although it is a major economic force in the area, the airport has not always been popular. The land used for the airport had a mix of prior uses. One of the airport's longest runways lies over a former neighborhood where residents were forcibly relocated using eminent domain in the 1970s.  Another section was built using landfill waste to extend the airport grounds into Boston Harbor. The landfill project was the butt of many jokes, but did allow for ground to be repurposed instead of being left idle. In General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport got its first new runway in 40 years, in a move that was designed to add capacity and reduce noise. The new runway reduces the amount of flying done overland in the Boston area. As the new runway approach route does water take-offs and landings, travelers will want to grab window seats more often to get a great view over the Boston area by sea. Getting to Logan by land is possible by car, bus, ferry or rail. The South Station of the MBTA Silver Line connects with all the Logan terminals. Somewhat oddly for non-natives, the Blue Line's Airport Stop does not arrive at the airport, but getting off at the stop does give access to shuttles that go to and from the airport. The water shuttle is accessed by taking a shuttle from the terminal to the dock and negotiating with the water taxis waiting there. Cab and limousine service is regulated and managed by Massport at each terminal."

"Harvard Square","Massachusetts","Harvard Square - Boston, Massachusetts - An Entire Neighborhood that isn't just a Square","Harvard Square is a triangular area in central Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and John F. Kennedy Street. Adjacent to the historic center of Harvard University and Harvard Yard, the square (as it is called locally) functions as a commercial center for Harvard students and residents of Cambridge and the western suburbs west of Boston. It is also home to the Harvard station, a major MBTA Bus Red Line subway transportation hub. In a broad sense, the name Harvard Square can refer to the entire neighborhood surrounding this intersection for several blocks in each direction. The commune near Cambridge has a large park with a playground, baseball field, and some local landmarks. Although today a commercial area, the plaza features famous residents of prior periods, as the colonial poet Anne Bradstreet. High pedestrian traffic makes it a gathering place for street musicians, singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, who attended nearby Tufts University, is known for having played here during their university years. Until 1984, the Harvard Square stop is the northern terminus of the Red Line, and still functions as an important transfer station between subway, bus, tram and roads. Automobile traffic can be heavy, and parking is difficult. Most bus lines serving the area north and west run through a tunnel adjacent to the subway tunnel. Originally built for the trams (which last ran in 1958) and is still used by highway trucks and buses, the tunnel reduces bus traffic in the center of Harvard Square, and allows buses crossing the plaza without having to face car traffic. In the center of the plaza is the old subway kiosk in Harvard Square, now a newsstand, Out of Town news, newspapers and magazines worldwide population.

This monument, sculptor Konstantin Simun, pays tribute not only to the late puppeteer beloved, but all the street artists who are an integral part of the plaza, especially during the summer months. The black region near the newsstand and the subway entrance is called the hole. Its field appearance attracts skateboarders and, in general, young people of secondary schools and kids from surrounding neighborhoods that have been associated with the countercultural movements such as punk, hardcore, straight edge, and gothic subcultures. The contrast between the faithful and often older and more conservatively dressed people associated with nearby Harvard University and the businesses in the square occasionally leads to tension. Harvard sports teams and clubs, including the track teams and all male social clubs, are known to make use of this contrast, by encouraging or sometimes require new members to participate in humorous or humiliating performances in The Pit As part of these members' initiation into the group. One block east of the pit, an outdoor cafe tables always have availability for chess players, including Murray Turnbull, with his ever-present Play, the sign of Chessmaster.''"

Historically, a neighboring section of Dorchester, Mattapan became part of Boston in Dorchester and was annexed in 1870. In the 2000 census this area had a population of 28,145. Like other neighborhoods of the late 19th and early 20th century, Mattapan developed, residential and commercial, such as railroads and streetcars and made downtown Boston increasingly more accessible. Predominately residential, Mattapan is a mix of public housing, small apartment buildings, houses, and two and three family houses (known locally as Three Deckers). Blue Hill Avenue and Mattapan Square, where Blue Hill Avenue, River Street and Cummins Highway meet, is the commercial heart of the neighborhood, home to banks, law offices, restaurants and shops. The new Mattapan branch of the Boston Public Library opened in 2009 at a cost of over $4 million. In the 1960s and 70s Mattapan underwent a major change in the composition of its population. It went from a predominantly Jewish neighborhood to one that is now largely African American and Caribbean America and has a population of 37,486 and more than 77% African American and Caribbean American. The years between 1968 and 1970 constituted the most dramatic period of transition ethnic Mattapan. According to Levine and Harmon in his book Death of an American Jewish community, to comment on the area, this successful and fear in residents of the neighborhood created by real estate agents selling panic occurred and the flight of whites. The banking consortium Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (B-BURG) allegedly led to the Jewish community in Mattapan and are claimed to assume partial responsibility for the deterioration of the neighborhood, especially along the Blue Hill Avenue corridor. This widespread belief has been disputed, with differences between Catholics and the life of the Jewish community in Boston is the largest contributing factor. Again, according to Levine and Harmon, the reason behind this attack on the community was at the lowest levels of the market to buy property, sell the property with federally guaranteed loans at inflated prices to black families do not could pay, and white for the community to buy property owned by banks in the suburbs. Today Mattapan is seeing another shift in the larger population, but again nature of housing, as a large number of immigrants from Haiti and other Caribbean countries continue to move in. Mattapan now has the largest Haitian community, in Massachusetts, and is also largely of African Americans and immigrants from other Caribbean countries. The streetcar line of the MBTA Mattapan Ashmont Mattapan serves and several bus lines. Fairmount Line MBTA Commuter Rail also serves on Morton Street Mattapan, providing service to downtown Boston and its suburbs.

The Museum was founded in 1870 and opened in 1876, with much of its collection taken from the Ateneo Art Gallery in Boston. Francis Davis Millet was instrumental in starting the Art School attached to the museum and get Emil Otto Grundmann (1844 - 1890) named its first director. Originally it was located in an ornate brick Gothic Revival building, designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham and located in Copley Square in the Back Bay of Boston.

The first section of Lowell's neoclassical design was completed in 1909, and featured a 500-ft (150 m), granite facade, cut along Huntington Avenue, the grand rotunda, and the associated exhibition galleries. Ms. Robert Dawson Evans then funded the total cost of building the next section of the museum's master plan. This wing along the marshes of Back Bay, opened in 1915 and houses art galleries.

This expansion increases the size of the MFA by 28% with an additional 133,500 square feet (12,400 m2) of space. The new wing was designed in a restricted way, London's contemporary architecture firm Foster and Partners, headed by Lord (Norman) Foster. Groundbreaking for the addition took place in 2006. In the process, the current garden patio will become a climate-controlled for years round glass enclosure. Landscape architects Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads and courtyards. The opening of the new wing is planned for late 2010."
"Natick Collection","Massachusetts","Natick Collection - Natick, MA - A mall in Natick, MA with ample parking and lots of shops","Until February of 2007 the Natick Collection was known at Natick Mall which is a large shopping mall found between routes 30 and 9 in Natick, Massachusetts. The facility is owned by the General Growth Properties. After being expanded during 2007 and 2009 the mall now has nearly two million square feet and nearly three hundred retailers. The square footage and stores make it the largest mall found in New England. Sears and Filene's were originally the two stand alone stores that a parking lot separated. In 1964 the mall construction began between the two stores. There were twenty-five stores in the one story Natick Mall that opened during 1965. It was the Boston metropolitan area's second enclosed mall. There were two small anchors found at the north side of the mall when it opened, Boston Baby and Woolworth's. In addition there was a large entertainment/fountain area in from of the new Sears mall entrances. During the early eighties Boston Baby store closed and the facility was remodeled into a new retail wing. The wing has about a dozen smaller stores and a food court. In 1985 the York Steak House close to Sears closed and was transformed in much the same way. The former site of the York Steak House became the site of a number of retailers leading to the mall having over fifty restaurants and stores. In 1991 the owners began expanding the structure after deciding that it was beginning to age and wasn't big enough. The goal was to add Lord & Taylor as a third anchor on the second floor and at the main entrance of the mall. The mall was sold to Homart Development Compay which is a division of the Sears real estate during 1992 and the construction efforts came to a halt. The Shopper's World which is adjacent to the mall was also bought by the company and developed two entirely new concepts for the complete rebuilding. Filene's which was a major tenant refused to spend any more money on to build a new building at the Shopper's World and the plans Homart had were reversed. The result was the new Shopper's World and Natick Mall. In 1993 the mall's original tenants were moved to the complex for the Shopper's World. In 1994 a new two story building with more than two hundred stores was built and opened which included the relocated Jordon Marsh, Sears and Lord & Taylor. In late 2006 there was a large scale expansion and renovation of the Natick Collection. During September of 2007 the renovation project's first phase was opened to the public even though not all of the stores were ready to open at this time. The rest of the stores planned to open throughout 2007 and 2008. The variety offered by the Natick Collection makes it a must for all of your shopping needs if you are ever in the Natick, MA area. The hours of the stores may vary from those of the Natick Collection and should be contacted individually to confirm actual hours."

"New Harbour Mall","Massachusetts","New Harbour Mall - Fall River, MA - An enclosed mall in Fall River with Wal-Mart and Kmart anchors","The city of Fall River, Massachusetts can be found in Bristol County approximately forty-six miles away from Boston and sixteen miles from Providence, Rhode Island. The town which began as a small Plymouth Colony back in 1620 is best known for being the home of the infamous Lizzie Bordon. A little known fact is that it is also the home of the New Harbour Mall in addition to having its government center housed over an interstate highway. The New Harbour Mall is an enclosed mall that can be found in Fall River, Massachusetts that was opened during 1970. It is the only mall in the United States that has competitors as anchors in the form of both Wal-Mart and Kmart. The mall is located at 372 William S Canning Boulevard, the management office for the mall is also found in Fall River. The original anchor stores were Grant City which is W.T. Grant's discount division, and Bradlees. The Grant City Chain of Bradlees closed during 1976 and Kmart was put in to replace it. Skylights, canopies, a new entrance added and common areas of the mall redesigned during 1993. The offices for the Sovereign Bank are also located in the New Harbour Mall. The mall has Fall River's only active movie theatre the Cinema Treasures. The cinema which was located in the mall for decades prior to its closing in September of 2002 had eight screens. The mall is situated on the Massachusetts and Rhode Island line in the southern portion of Fall River which is an old mill town. Bradlees is another anchor of the mall which was once just the Harbour Mall. New Harbour Mall is the only mall in the Fall River area. During the first part of the 1990's the management had the exterior repainted pink and green pastel colors and did renovations to its interior. It was during this time that the name of the mall was changed from the Harbour Mall to the New Harbour Mall. The mall has managed to maintain study occupancy and keep the majority of its patrons intact since this change was made. The Bradless chain folded leaving the most popular and largest anchor store vacant during the first part of 2001. Wal-mart opened in its place during 2002 giving it the distinction of having two rival stores as anchors, both of which are still there today. The New Harbour mall is still open at 372 William S Canning Boulevard in Fall River, Massachusetts and remains the town's only mall. If you are ever in the area you should be sure to stop by the New Harbour Mall while you're not busy enjoying the vast amount of history that the Fall River area of Massachusetts has to offer.

"Nickerson State Park","Massachusetts","Nickerson State Park, Brewster, MA","Nickerson State Park is located in Brewster, Massachusetts. Brewster is located on Cape Cod as one of the places visitors might stay. The state park allows for camping in the event a hotel is not what a visitor wishes. The interesting thing about the state park is its beauty. It reminds many visitors of the Berkshire Hills or piney woods of the Carolinas due to its pine trees and other foliage. It is actually very dense woodland in an area that should be marshland and sandy beach. Within the woods are eight fresh water ponds that are crystal clear in appearance. When visitors walk through the woods there are no rivers or streams visible to feed the ponds. Instead they are fed by underground sources from several thousands of years back. Kettle Ponds as these are known were formed by 300 glaciers which retreated from Cape Cod 10,000 years ago. Today groundwater and precipitation are the only water sources that will determine the level of the ponds. Nickerson State Park is 1900 acres of land with more than 420 campsites. Yurt Camping, the amphitheater and the eight miles of roads, hiking, and biking all make up the adventures one can have at the park. A 22 mile Cape Cod Rail Trail is connected to the bike paths. The ponds are also kept stocked for fishing with trout. It is possible to swim in Flax Pond or canoe around it. Visitors can also bird watch or catch and release fish at Higgins Pond. During the year are interpretive and recreational programs for visitors and locals. To arrive at the park one needs to take 6A west towards Brewster from Route 6. The entrance is two miles from the exit. Cliff Pond is the largest pond in the Park. It dominates the center of the park land with two different parking areas and camping facilities nearby. Little Cliff Pond is also close, though it is perhaps a sixth of the bigger pond in size. Keeler's Pond and Triangle Pond are the two smallest ponds within the park. Some of the park runs right up to the bay and beach area. There are fees for camping and getting into the park. Horseback riding is one recreational activity not yet mentioned. There are numerous riding trails one can take if walking or hiking is not for you. In the winter season the park is open. They allow cross country skiing along the trails, though they are not groomed. Instead the snow is packed down by those who ski. Since the cross country trails are also those being hiked the park map will be a great guide for moving around even in winter. Mountain biking is yet another recreational activity one can enjoy while at Nickerson State Park. There are specific trails one must keep to in order to avoid the walkers and hikers. Groups are also allowed to use the facilities and state park for day trips to learn about the conservation and flora and fauna."
"North End Neighborhood","Massachusetts","North End Neighborhood - Boston, Massachusetts - Small but Diverse Neighborhood District","North End of Boston is the oldest community residential town where people have lived continuously since it was established in the 1630s. While small at just a third of a mile, the district has approximately 100 eating establishments, and a variety of tourist attractions. It is known as the Little Italy of the city by its Italian-American population. The North End was home to some of the wealthiest residents of Boston and later the first community of black people created by freed slaves and escaped. In the 19th century, the Irish began to migrate into the far north in large numbers and dominated the area until about in 1919, when the Boston Molasses Disaster occurred. This event was infamous for killing several residents. This is one of the strangest engineering accidents today. The North End became a center of Jewish life in Boston; Hebrew inscriptions can still be found in several buildings. On 15 January 1919, the North End was the site of the Molasses Disaster in Boston. La Casa Delgado, reported by the Boston Globe as having the uncontested distinction of being the narrowest house in Boston, is near the top of the hill Copp view of Old North Church and Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge. In the 20th century, the North End became the center of the Italian community of Boston. It is still largely residential and well known for its small, authentic Italian restaurants and Italian coffee first, Caffe Vittoria. The construction of the elevated central artery (Interstate 93) in the 1950s, divided the northern end of the rest of Boston. With the completion of the Big Dig, the old elevated highway has been completely eliminated and the North End has re-joined the rest of the city. Although the north end is part of Boston's original area of settlement, most of the architecture seen today dates from the late nineteenth century to early 20th century (neighborhood architecture is especially prominent). The neighborhood has a mix of architecture from all periods of American history, including structures such principles as the Old North Church (1723), the Paul Revere House (1680), the Pierce-Hichborn House (1711), and Clough House (1712). The historical COPP Hill is the site of the Copp's Hill Burying ground, one of the oldest cemeteries in America. The cemetery contains many graves dating back centuries and principles including Puritan divines Cotton and Increase Mather and Prince Hall, founder of Prince Hall Masonry. The House of Delgado, the narrowest house in Boston, across the street. The Brink famous Grand Theft occurred in the North End. The Brink's building where the robbery took place still stands as the North End Parking Garage. The Freedom Trail passes through the North End, making official stops in some of the sites listed above. In recent times, many other cultures have settled in the North End. Today it is a cultural melting pot of diversity."
"Northshore Mall","Massachusetts","Northshore Mall - Peabody, MA - An enclosed mall in Peabody, MA","The Northshore Mall opened during September of 1958 as an open air, outdoor shopping center. It was built in a field that Elias Hasket Derby once owned. Derby's daughter and son-in-law Nathaniel and Elizabeth West built Oak Hill Estate that Samuel McIntire designed. In 1850 it was sold to Richard S. Rogers for use as a summer residence. Parts of its interior were sold to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts by his son Jacob and his wife. The St. Joseph Juniorate was established by the Congregation of St. Francis Xavier which purchased the property during 1922. Portions of the land were used for various forms of farming, fountains and gardens. In 1955 after the estate had been torn down the land was purchased by Allied Stores and the shopping center built. Beverly had been the original destination of the center. The original anchors where Sears, J.J. Newberry, Stop & Shop, RH Stearns, Kresge, Filene's and an adjoining Jordan Marsh. A cinema, bowling alley, and Kiddietown which was a small amusement park were the first recreational facilities in the Northshore Mall. In 1960 the Northshore Mall became home to Mt. Carmel Chapel's St. Therese Society. It was the first chapel to ever be built in a shopping center which opened the door for other chapels to be placed in malls. The dental office, chapel gift shop and the chapel can all be gotten to from an elevator that is adjacent to the main entrance located by Joe's Bar & Grill. Peabody Police Department's Community Outreach Center is also in the mall. Sears being expanded to a full-line anchor was among the changes that the Northshore Mall underwent during the 1970's and 1980's. The entire center was completely enclosed in 1972 starting with a small portion close to the Sears store. This was to assist the Northshore Mall in competing with the Liberty Tree Mall. There was an underground tunnel for delivery incorporated into the original construction of the Northshore Mall in 1958 that went the mall's entire length. The cleared snow from the central concourse was dropped into dump trucks waiting in the tunnel through traps before the mall was enclosed. Today the tunnel is used to remove refuse and deliveries. Allied gave an interest in the North Mall to Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. during 1986. New England Development acquired the mall in 1992. This lead to a massive renovation which expanded the mall to almost two million feet, this expansion was completed during 1994. The amusement park was replaced with a replacement store Filene's built at the mall's northwest end. There was also a new Lord & Taylor at this end, both stores opened during 1993. J.C. Penney was placed in the original Filene's and a food court was added to the mall. The management of the Northshore Mall was taken over by Simon Property Group when the New England Development sold it to them during 1999. From 1994 until 2005 the structure and anchors of the mall remained mostly the same with the exception of Jordan Marsh changing its name to Macy's during 1996."

Plymouth is a town situated in southern Massachusetts, on Plymouth Bay, approximately 34 miles southeast of Boston. Plymouth was the site of the first European settlement in New England and is now a tourism and shipping/fishing industry. Plymouth was founded on December 16th, 1620, by the Pilgrims. The settlement became part of the seat of Plymouth County in 1633, later a part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1691. The Pilgrims were a group of English Separatists, who founded the colony of Plymouth in 1620. In the earlier years of the 17th century, a small number of English Puritans broke away from the Church of England and committed themselves to a life centered around the Holy Bible. Many of them were farmers, lacking education, and had little social or political standing within their community. This group left Leiden, made their way to Speedwell, on the first ship. From there the sailed to Southampton, England, joining a second group and boarded the Mayflower. The group landed in Cape Cod and could not settle and from there made the historical journey to Plymouth Rock. Plymouth Rock has since become an American icon. Representative of overcoming trials and tribulations, discovery, liberty and freedom. Plymouth Rock, weighs in at around 10 tons and is made of granite, and formed some 680 million years ago and transported to west or south Boston, via a glacier. While trying to move the rock, in 1774 with some 40 teams of oxen, the rock was damaged and split. In 1819, a number of Pilgrims decided to form a historical society to honor past Pilgrims. A building was erected in 1824, and named Pilgrim Hall, it was a place for meetings as well as Pilgrim artifacts. It was the decided that this building would make a more suitable home for the rock, so it was moved in 1834, this is how it acquired its infamous crack when fell off the transport vehicle in front of the Court House. In 1859, cornerstones of the new Plymouth Rock Canopy and Forefathers Monument were laid, the project was not completed until 1867, it contained only the lower portion rock, along with the remains of Pilgrims believed to have perished during the first winter. On July 4th, 1834, the upper piece of the rock was moved in front of Pilgrim Hall. Thus both pieces of the rock were reunited.

The events include The Cranberry Harvest Festival, The annual Clam Chowder Contest, Nantucket Restaurant week, and the Nantucket Historical Association Harvest Fair. The events include such activities as bobbing for apples, pumpkin decorating, colonial era games, and much more. These events are for the whole family whether you are visiting for the day or a year round resident of Nantucket Island. Many people that have come as tourists to the various family friendly events have fallen in love with the old world charm found on the island and decided to become full time residents of Nantucket. Nantucket is a lovely place to call home and is one of the few real estate markets that show no sign of slowing down. In fact the median price of a home on Nantucket Island is $1.35 million dollars. This is more than one million dollars higher than the average home that is sold on the mainland. There are very few homes on the market for less than one million dollars which can make it difficult for a year round resident to purchase a home. According to the U.S. Department of Labor the mean annual salary of the 15,100 people employed on the Island year round was $41,740 dollars. The leading industries on Nantucket Island are, Construction, Education, health and social services, Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services.

The Steamship authority provides year round service, but if the weather turns rough there can be delays. Nantucket Island is about twenty-five miles off of the coast of mainland Massachusetts. The small community is a place that is defined by the character of the 12,000 year round residents, but influenced by the 40,000 other people that call Nantucket Island home in the summer months. Many of the summer residents have left the island before the Harvest Festival begins so this is an ideal time to come see all the island has to offer. The crowds are greatly diminished, the rentals are less expensive, and the locals will be more apt to make an out of towner feel at home."

"The Ranch Golf Club","Massachusetts","The Ranch Golf Club, Southwick, Massachusetts - An Upscale Golf Course That's Put Southwick on the Golfing Map","The Ranch Golf Club is located a little more than 100 miles west of Boston, at the Foothills of the Berhshires in Southwick, Massachusetts - a trivia-like deviation of land known as the Southwick Jog'' on the border of Massachusetts and Connecticut. With the opening of The Ranch in 2001, Southwick was added to the map for another reason, its upscale golf course. The course is the design of golf architect Damian Pascuzzo, who had previously worked primarily on the west coast. The result is a course with a flowing layout over a former ranch/dairy land and the timbered ridge behind, with great scenery and variety of shot-making. The course begins along the base of the north-south ridge, then winds into wooded uplands, making for a mix of raw power on some holes and clever strategies on others. The par-72, 18-hole course plays to 7,174 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 140. The first three holes will remind golfers of a seaside resort, and feature treeless, mounded contours and ragged bunkers. And the first hole has been described as one of the best first holes to be found. Many courses open with something bland and routine, but Hole No. 1 at The Ranch is not only picturesque, but a reachable par-5 that begins on a slightly elevated tee. The hole plays to 484 yards from the Blue tees, and aggressive golfers must contend with a small section of fairway on the left guarded by a large, solitary tree. A large pond looms on the left beyond it, and the hole ends with an undulating green well-guarded by bunkers and water. Another noteworthy hole is No. 4, the most difficult handicap on the course. This is a tough par-4 that plays to 404 yards from the Blue tees, but also plays uphill to a hilltop bordered by dense trees. Getting to the green can be a challenge as well, as it curves to the right and is fronted by a slope into which several bunkers have been carved. Another noteworthy hole is the par-5 No. 16, which plays to a daunting 616 yards from the Black tees, and 578 from the Blues. The good news is that golfers get to launch a tee shot on this downhill hole, which was formerly a ski slope, and hope they don't find one of the deep hollows. On the second shot players will have a choice of hitting conservatively and laying up short of the two ponds on both sides of the expansive green, or going for it in two. Since opening, The Ranch has received many accolades, including being ranked as one of the best courses (and the only public golf course on the list) in the state, and one of the Best Golf Courses in America by Golf Digest. And Golf Boston Magazine rated The Ranch as the #2 course in its annual review of The 50 Best You Can Play. Practice facilities at The Ranch include two spacious hitting areas, with up to 20 grass tee stations and six target greens. There are also practice greens for pitching, chipping, bunker play and putting. The course also features a pro shop and lessons are available. For dining, the course features The Ranch Grille for lunch or dinner in a renovated, turn-of-the-century barn setting."

"Walter D. Stone Memorial Zoo","Massachusetts","Walter D. Stone Memorial Zoo - Boston, Massachusetts - small public zoo covering 26 acres","The Walter D. Stone Memorial Zoo is located in Stoneham, Massachusetts. More commonly known as the Stone Zoo, it is a popular family and school attraction year round. The Zoo is operated by Zoo New England, which also manages the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, MA. Originally established in 1905 as Middlesex Fells Zoo, the park was renamed in honor of long-time zoo director Walter D. Stone in 1969. The zoo was a popular area attraction through the 1970s and 1980s, but fell into disrepair when the state of Massachusetts cut all funding to the zoo in 1990 and shut it down. The public rose up and came together to call for the Stone Zoo to remain open, and the state Senate took up the cause, helping to set up a non-profit corporation to collect donations and manage the zoo as a private entity. Unfortunately, the transition was a rocky one, and the zoo lost most of its large animals and its accreditation. In the early years of the 2000s, Zoo New England, the non-profit corporation that runs both Stone Zoo and Franklin Park Zoo stepped up fund raising efforts with publicity and a series of high profile events to bring the zoo back to life. In a few short years, the zoo has renovated and added several new exhibits. The focus of the zoo has shifted from large exotic animals to a stellar collection of small animals in zoologically correct exhibits. Stone Zoo features frequent special events for the community, including the very popular winter Lights at the Zoo exhibit. Members and community can also book private events like birthday parties. Stone Zoo offers classes for home schooling families, as well as personalized tours of the zoo and animal encounters.
