"Bridgeton Covered Bridge","Indiana","Bridgeton Covered Bridge - Rockville, Indiana - Covered Bridge","The present day Bridgeton Covered Bridge, built in 2006 by local citizen volunteers and the state of Indiana, is a replacement for the original bridge that was burned down at the hand of an arsonist on April 28, 2005. The culprit, Jesse Payne, who was also charged with the attempted arson of Mansfield Covered Bridge was deemed unfit to stand trial and institutionalized. The first bridge, built in 1868 by Joseph J. Daniels's crew, was 245 feet long, or 267 feet long if measuring the 11-foot overhang at each end. It was a double span Burr Arch Truss structure with 13 feet wide by 12 feet high portal clearance. The original was retired, or closed to traffic, in 1967 after 99 years of service upon completion of a more stable concrete bridge. In the old days, the message Cross this bridge at a walk'' was printed on both ends so that the trotting of horses wouldn't damage it. Once considered the most photographed covered bridge in Indiana, maybe even in the world, Bridgeton Covered Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 and in the World Guide to Covered Bridges,'' published by the National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges, Inc. in 1989. There was a bridge raising dedication ceremony for the new bridge, which was to be built with reference to the original blueprints, held on January 12, 2006 when fundraising for the project began. Like the original, the new Bridgeton Covered Bridge was built over a waterfall atop Big Raccoon Creek. Between February and June of 2006 local landowners and the Indiana State Forests donated tree, which were harvested and delivered by local logging companies. Local sawmill owners and volunteers sawed the logs into the necessary beams and boards. From July through September of 2006 the bridge was constructed from the ground up. The official dedication took place on October 1, 2006 followed by a community meal for everyone who helped to build the new bridge. Typically there were 8 to 18 daily volunteers through the week and weekend during the process, and nearly $200,000 was raised through fundraising for the reconstruction effort. In September 1997, the Parke County Commissioners named The Bridgeton Covered Bridge Association caretaker of the bridge and today they continue to maintain it through the Bridgeton Covered Bridge Fund. 2 million or more people attend the Parke County Covered Bridge Festival each year. The festival celebrating the county's thirty-one covered bridges begins on the 2nd Friday in October and lasts for ten days. Rockville, Indiana, the location of Bridgeton, has hosted the festival since 1957. In October 2006, the highlight of the 50th anniversary festival was the newly constructed Bridgeton Covered Bridge."

The museum also celebrates the historic role of the State of Indiana in relation to the sport of automobile racing. The museum is just inside of Gate 2 (the main gate) of the Speedway. Over 75 race cars are on display within the museum.  Among them are Indy 500 winners as well as other vehicles that have participated in renowned car racing events across the globe. Each of the cars at the museum has a brief explanation of its history for visitors to read. Many of the cars found here have also participated in automobile shows; museum cars have won various awards at shows. Museum guides, who are easily identified by their red jackets, are happy to answer questions about the museum and any of the memorabilia on display. The museum hosts a large collection of trophies as well as historic cars. The Tony Hulman Theater which seats 48 people shows historic early racing footage as well as Indy 500 highlights. There is no additional charge of admission for the museum theater. Among the things to do at the museum is the opportunity to sit in an actual Indy 500 race car and have your photo taken for a fee or with your own camera free of charge. Pictures of Hall of Fame inductees are on display as well as the Indy 500 winners over the history of the race. In 1957 a Foundation was created to operate and maintain support for the Hall of Fame Museum. It has been doing so ever since that time. In 1987 the speedway itself was declared a National Historic Landmark although it is privately owned by the Hulman family. The Indianapolis Hall of Fame Museum (at the Motor Speedway) has had a partnership with the Washington D.C. based Smithsonian for over a quarter of a century, lending cars and other memorabilia to that museum. The museum provides a 90 minute Grounds Tour of the historic Motor Speedway. The tour, carried out on comfortable tour buses, includes stops at the famous start/finish line Yard of Bricks,'' the Victory Podium and the Gasoline Alley garage space.

"Indianapolis Motor Speedway","Indiana","Indianapolis Motor Speedway - Indianapolis, Indiana - Leader in Auto Racing in Heart of the Midwest Since 1909","The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has been registered as a National Historic Landmark since 1987. The Speedway is located at 4790 W. 16th St. in Indianapolis, Indiana. The raceway was first built in 1909 and is most known as the permanent home of the Indy500 race which takes place annually on Memorial Day weekend. The first 500 mile race took place in May of 1911. Today the event attracts more than 250,000 spectators and is broadcast around the world. The historic 2.5 mile oval race track is also called the Brickyard. The track was originally built of crushed rock and tar but switched to brick in order to provide a smoother surface the same year of construction (1909). Resurfacing with asphalt did not occur until 1976. Today a line of the original brick surfacing remains in place marking the start/finish line of the track. The track was originally built to test new automobile designs and race them in order for the public to see them competing and thus promote auto industry sales. A new 2.605 mile Formula One track was inaugurated at the Speedway in 2008. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway has hosted Grand Prix Formula One events and NASCAR racing as well as the Indianapolis 500 race and other events. It is undeniably the most renowned automobile racing venue in the world. The Speedway also operates a neighboring hotel and 18-hole golf course. Just inside the main entrance to the facility the Hall of Fame Museum is found. The museum displays more than 75 race cars, as well as a wall of winners' photos of the Indy 500 and other memorabilia of the Indy 500 and other racing history from around the globe. One of the major attractions at the museum is being able to sit in a race car chassis and pose for a souvenir photo. Ninety minute tours of the track and its different areas are available 4 times a day between March and Thanksgiving, spaces on the tours are limited and special tours can be arranged for groups. The Hulman family, which owns the track today, bought the raceway in 1945. Tony Hulman named Wilbur Shaw General Manager and President. In the early 50's it was Shaw who would coin the now world famous racing phrase of Gentlemen, Start Your Engines here at the Speedway. The Speedway has always been at the forefront of pioneering new racing technologies. One example is the SAFER barrier made of steel and foam installed originally at the track's corners in 2002 and later upgraded. The barriers were designed and improved by the Indy Racing League in conjunction with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Midwest Roadside Safety Facility. These barriers were built to lessen crash impact for a vehicle and thus improve safety for its driver. The Nomex fiber firesuit is another one of the innovations in the sport first designed and used at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway."
"Irvington Historic District in Indianapolis, Indiana","Indiana","Irvington Historic District in Indianapolis, Indiana"," Irvington, Indiana was originally founded as a suburban town in 1870.  The town formed along winding roads made of dirt and brick that spoke of the Romanesque design era. Originally, the town was a quiet haven for artists, politicians, academics, military generals and local industry lived. However, in 1902, Irvington was annexed and though it is a part of the city, the area still remains very much like a private neighborhood. Located on the Western edge of Indianapolis, Irvington is five miles away from downtown Indianapolis on the edge of Warren Township. The neighborhood is located on the historic road US 40, and through the 1900's, a trolley ran from Irvington into Indianapolis. Today, the town is the largest historically preserved location in Indianapolis and has approximately 2,800 buildings and 1,600 parcels of land. Irvington was the home of the only artist movement in Central Indiana and was named for a specific place, the Irvington Group. During the 1900's the Irvington Group lived, worked and exhibited art in Irvington and today many of the houses and studios remain standing. The arts were and are still taught at the Irvington Lodge, Bona Thomas Memorial Library and the Studio School and Gallery. The town is both historically and architecturally important to Indiana, because it contains fine examples of every type of American architecture style from 1870 through 1950. There are examples of Italianate, Victorian Gothic, Queen Anne, French Second Empire, and Colonial and Tudor Revival. US 40, or as it is more commonly known, Washington Street, is home to several buildings and businesses of historical importance such as the old bank and the Irving Theater. The Benton House is a local landmark in Irvington, the home was built by Allen R. Benton in 1873. The Irvington Historic Landmarks Foundation was formed in 1966, and purchased the property and restored the home. In 1973, the home was placed on the National of Historic Places and is listed as a museum; the Benton House is the only landmark in Indiana open to the public. The Stephenson Mansion is a home in Indianapolis that has the most interesting history. The home was built for William H. H. Graham in 1895; in 1923, the home was purchased by D.C. Stephenson who remodeled the home to resemble a Civil War era plantation house. D.C. Stephenson was a well known affiliate of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. He has a long and checkered past and this in turn has brought more attention to the mansion. Today, the mansion remains shrouded in controversy and intrigue, with many visitors claiming the location to be haunted. Irvington continues to remain a family friendly community. Every year there are festivals held during the spring, summer and autumn that invite guests to get to know about town of Irvington and its history. The town welcomes people with a warmth and friendliness that are well known to visitors to the Midwest."
"Lafayette Square Mall","Indiana","Lafayette Square Mall - Indianapolis, Indiana - Indiana's First & Oldest Indoor Mall","Located seven miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis, Lafayette Square Mall is Indiana's oldest indoor shopping center. It was developed by Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. in 1968. At that time, it featured four anchor tenants: Sears, Penney's, G. C. Murphy, and Blocks. In the early 1970s, Lazarus and L. S. Ayres were added to the mall, which enjoyed its heyday for the better part of three decades. It attracted Wards department store when Blocks moved out in 1986, and Waccamaw replaced G. C. Murphy in 1993. A food court was then added in 1997, featuring McDonalds, Luca Pizza, Cinnabon, Wok-Right-In, Nick's Gyros, and Charley's Steakery. Lafayette Square's decline began when Wards closed in 1997. Statistically high crime rates and low sales plagued the mall in the opening years of the 21st century. Despite renovations, other stores followed suit and shuttered, until not one of the original anchors remained. Today, Lafayette Square Mall is owned by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation and managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. Its enclosed shopping area covers 1.2 million square feet of retail space, situated on 113 acres adjacent to Interstate 65. Two department stores, Burlington Coat Factory and Shoppers World, now serve as the primary tenants. A third anchor is the 75,000-square-foot indoor amusement park and family entertainment center known as Xscape. Its facilities include a buffet style restaurant, several themed dining rooms, and a sports bar for adults. Among other amenities, Xscape offers laser tag, go-karting, bumper cars, mini-bowling, mini-golf and a game arcade, too. More than a dozen categories of goods are sold at 90 smaller retailers positioned between the anchor stores. These include cards / books / records / stationery, children's fashions / shoes / toys, family entertainment items, specialty retail / gifts / luggage, and home accessories. Also available are men's fashion, cellular services, men's and women's shoes, specialty food, sporting goods / apparel and women's fashion, as well as personal and professional services. National retailers represented at Lafayette Square Mall include RadioShack, Payless ShoeSource, Victoria's Secret, Kay Jewelers, and Bath & Body Works. There are also branches of The Children's Place, GameStop, Champs, Foot Locker, and The Finish Line, among others. And wireless phone service providers are also here in force, including Sprint/Nextel, T-Mobile, Crossroads Wireless/AT&T, and the Phone Zone. In 2007, Wal-Mart opened a new supercenter in the Lafayette Square area as part of the company's Jobs and Opportunity Zone (JOZ) program. It has been joined by another new retailer nearby, Garden Ridge. With a $550 million redevelopment project taking place along Interstate 465 and urban renewal getting underway on West 38th Street, the mall is poised for a renaissance of sorts. Estimates put the number of cars passing by the mall each day at 154,000. One new program intended to spur customer loyalty at Lafayette Square Mall is The Shopping Club. By simply entering an email address on the mall's web site, shoppers can receive money-saving coupons and receive advance notification of special deals and events. Lafayette Square Mall is open Monday through Saturday from 10am to 9pm, and on Sundays from noon to 6pm. Holiday hours, anchor store openings and restaurant hours sometimes vary.

Kennedy. The park covers the land where Abraham Lincoln lived with his family from 1816-1830. Lincoln lived there from the age of seven to the age of twenty one. Nancy Hanks Lincoln, his mother, is buried in Pioneer Cemetery located on the grounds in the park. The visitor center has a 15 minutes film titled Forging Greatness - Lincoln in Indiana that depicts his life, a museum and memorial hall commemorating him. The museum has original artifacts and exhibits that show Lincolns early life.

Each of the five murals was carved from a solid block of sandstone measuring 8 feet by 13 1/2 feet wide and weighing 10 tons. The bookstore offers an array of postcards, brochures, and other educational material that highlight Lincoln's life in Indiana. The visitor center was built with material indigenous to Indiana. The cherry wood tables, chairs, benches and pews were all constructed from local timber while the limestone was hand cut from Bloomington, Indiana. The walking tour includes a visit to Lincoln's mother's grave and a visit to his boyhood log cabin home. Near her grave is the tallest flagpole in Indiana. His boyhood cabin is made of sandstone and cannot be accessed by visitors and may view the boyhood home from a physical barricade that surrounds the cabin.

Located in Indiana's capital city, Lucas Oil Stadium is also scheduled host to events such as NCAA men and women's basketball and the DCI World Championship in future years. Opened on August 16, 2008 after three years of construction, Lucas Oil Stadium replaced the RCA dome as the home playing field for the Colts. The opening game was between the Colts and the Buffalo Bills on August 24, but the first game played in the stadium was actually a series of high school football games as part of the PeyBeck Classic. The two games played were Noblesville High School versus Fishers High School, and New Palestine High School versus Whiteland Community High School. The stadium itself cost $720 million to build, and operating costs are expected to be $10 million more per year than the RCA Dome. The name of the venue is part of a $121 million deal with Lucas Oil, a California-based company that specializes in automotive products, particularly oil. The contract is expected to last over the course of 20 years. Lucas Oil Stadium is owned by the Indiana Stadium and Convention Building Authority. One of the stadium's most attractive features is its retractable roof, consisting of two panels weighing roughly 2.7 million pounds apiece. Opening or closing the roof takes about nine minutes. The venue offers 63,000 seats for football fans, and up to 70,000 for other events such as basketball games and concerts. All entrances to the venue are easily accessible for those with disabilities, and five guest service kiosks can be found about the stadium for fans in need of any extra assistance. Parking is available for roughly 9,000 vehicles around the venue, with 40,000 spaces available within an area of ten-blocks. Within the walls of Lucas Oil Stadium are 160 concession stands, 51 of these being permanent stands. Fans also have the option to visit the Colts Pro Shop, a multi-leveled center for anything even the most die-hard Colts fan might need.

Marengo cave has been open year round for tours since 1883 and was discovered accidently by fifteen year old Blanche Heistand and her eleven year old brother Orris. They climbed down the small opening in the ground, discovered the cavern and notified the landowner. Several days later the cave was open to the public. The Marengo caverns offer two tours, Crystal Palace Tour and Dripstone Lake Tour. Crystal Palace Tour is one third of a mile long. This tour offers the scenic Mirror Lake which is an underground lake that offers a jungle like thickness of formations and modern technology has added a music and light show in the below ground amphitheater. Dripstone Tour is a mile long tour that offers a view of the upside down wishing well commonly called penny ceiling. The thick mud made mostly of silt is a perfect resting ground for coins. This century old tradition is done by making a wish and throwing the coin at the ceiling. The coin will stick in the mud and legend has it the wish will come true. After decades of coins collecting on the roof it was decided to remove the coins to open up new space for additional coin throwers. Five hundred pounds of coins were collected with denominations from Canada, France, Belgium, Japan, Korea and The United States. Marengo caverns maintain a yearly temperature of 52 degrees. Included in the Marengo Cave National Landmark is the land designated as the national park. Blue River offers canoeing and kayaking. Hiking trails run along the Blue River or for the less energetic folk the park is filled with places to sit and relax. The park offers two levels of camping. Quaint cabins can be rented that offer spectacular views and they are located in the woodlands of the park. The cabins are rustic and campers are encouraged to bring their own bedding, and personal products. The cabins offer grills, electricity and community bathrooms and showers.

Called one of the seven hidden treasures of Indiana'' by the Indiana Division of Tourism, Menno-Hof consists of 24 different venues of six programmed areas that present Amish and Mennonite history and lifestyles through multi-media presentations. Exhibits include: a European courtyard, a dungeon with torture instruments, a 17th -century ship, a print shop, a simulated tornado and an authentic meeting house. There is also a display area featuring hands-on exhibits.

"Notre Dame Stadium","Indiana","Notre Dame Stadium - Notre Dame, Indiana - Exclusive Cathedral for Fighting Irish Football in Northernmost Indiana Famous for Sell-Out Crowds","Notre Dame Stadium was constructed under the leadership of football legend Knute Rockne in 1930, after Rockne's coaching had gained a national reputation for the Fighting Irish, the Notre Dame University team. The stadium was originally designed to seat 59,075 people. The stadium was erected in 4 months time, modeled after the larger Michigan stadium. Despite being known as the House that Rockne built, Rockne only coached one season in the new building prior to his death in a plane crash. A series of renovations in the 1990's expanded seating to an 80,795 capacity. Renovations included the construction of the current 3-tier press boxes and permanent lighting as well as more than doubling the home team locker space to 8,200 square feet and doubling the visiting team locker space as well. New goal posts were also among the changes made. The stadium measures a half a mile around and stands 45 feet high. As part of its mystique, no musical or other entertainment events have ever been allowed to use the stadium, maintaining its facilities strictly for the University gridiron team. From 1966 forward the Notre Dame Stadium has been notorious for its sell out crowds. Twenty thousand parking spaces are available at the stadium. The field, covered in natural Kentucky Blue grass is overseen by what is characterized as a Touchdown Jesus'' by football fans, a mural of a resurrected Christ with outstretched arms clearly visible from the stadium. Several similar renderings of the Christ figure exist elsewhere as well. The tenants of the stadium, the Fighting Irish have been home to seven Heisman Trophy winners and the Notre Dame team is credited with eleven championships. The stadium continues to be bereft of any giant electronic scoreboards maintaining a traditional feeling that is unadorned by high tech effects of most college stadiums today. Traditions at the stadium include the playing of all games on Saturdays to avoid night play. Prior to the remodeling in the mid 90's no lights illuminated the field. The lights currently existing were paid for by NBC which has exclusive television broadcasting rights for Notre Dame until 2015. Notre Dame and NBC have an agreement that allows only for to only day play at the stadium thus the lights were designed specifically for enhancing afternoon lighting. Seven home games per season are being played at the Notre Dame Stadium during regular playing season. Team practice usually occurs at Cartier Field where the team had played its games prior to the 1930 construction of the current park. The stadium and Notre Dame University is in Notre Dame, Indiana a town that practically consists of the University and 2 other religious colleges as an unincorporated community with no municipal government just to the north of South Bend, Indiana.

"Otter Creek Golf Course, North/West Course, Columbus, Indiana - A Championship Golf Course Secluded in the Southern Indiana Countryside","Indiana","Otter Creek Golf Course, North/West Course, Columbus, Indiana - A Championship Golf Course Secluded in the Southern Indiana Countryside","Otter Creek Golf Course consists of 27 championship holes - with North, West and East nines - located amid the serene Southern Indiana countryside.  The original 18 holes were designed by Robert Trent Jones and opened in 1964. Son Rees Jones was then called upon to design an additional nine holes that would compliment his father's design. The result is a links-style nine that opened in 1995. Otter Creek makes use of the natural contours of the land to create a championship-quality public course. The North/West combination course has been typically ranked among the Top 25 Public Courses in America since its inception, and was Ranked #31 on the list of 100 Greatest Public Courses by Golf Digest in 2003-2004. The North-West combination plays to 7,258 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 75.6 and a slope rating of 138. The course features Bent grass tees, fairways and greens, is said to always be in tournament condition,'' and is set in a secluded environment with no residential development. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 9 on the North Course. This is the #2-handicap hole on the North nine, and plays to 427 yards from the Gold tees, demanding both length and accuracy. Two fairway bunkers, pine trees and heavy rough guard the left side of the fairway, even though the hole calls for a tee shot in that direction. The fairway also dips down, rolling both left and right until leveling off around the 150-yard mark. Approach shots that come up short of the green will find the swale, and the green is also well bunkered. Once on the putting surface, golfers will have to contend with an undulating green that slopes from back to front. One of the more noteworthy holes on the West Course is the #1-handicap, a hole many golfers might conclude is a par-5 at 458 yards from the Gold tees. It's not. This par-4 is more manageable from the White tees as far as distance goes, but the challenge from any tee choice comes from a fairway that narrows and slopes downward, while being bracketed by bunkers. The approach shot will also prove challenging, as most lies will be downhill but will have to carry to an elevated green that's wide, but short, and breaks from the front to the back. Another noteworthy hole on the West Course is No. 7, the #2-handicap hole and another daunting par-4. At 447 yards from the back tees, this is actually the second-shortest par-4, but the difficulty comes from a dogleg left, three bunkers and assorted trees and shrubs. After the dogleg, the fairway rolls and descends to the green, which is guarded by a narrow opening between bunkers and another bunker to catch shots that go long. The green itself is huge, but the challenge is in getting an approach shot close to the pin. The practice facilities at Otter Creek include a driving range with natural grass tee area, along with chipping and putting areas. Club rental is also available from a fully stocked Pro Shop. The clubhouse provides a panoramic view of the golf course, and is also available for private events and golf outings."

Some of Prairie View's more noteworthy holes include No. 9, which ranks as the #1-handicap hole on the course and what some would call the unofficial signature'' hole. The par-4 hole plays to 433 yards from the Black tees and 387 yards from the Whites. This is a picturesque and challenging hole, with a small lake on the left side of the fairway near the tee, and another that ends up fronting the green as the hole curves slighting around the water hazard.

"Rock Hollow Golf Club","Indiana","Rock Hollow Golf Club, Peru, Indiana - A Golf Course With Terrain Unlike Any Other Course in the State","When advising golfers new to the Rock Hollow Golf Course, it's jokingly said that they should bring a pick axe'' in their bag. That's because the course has been laid out amid 300 acres that were once a stone quarry. The result is a course that's said to have heaving terrain'' unlike any other in the state, with lots of elevation changes, wetlands, lakes and trees. The course, which has been affectionately nicknamed The Rock,'' was designed by Tim Liddy, who is a protygy of renowned golf course architect Pete Dye. The club was built in 1995 and features more than 50 acres of cat-tailed wetlands, and often plays 60 feet below the surrounding ground level, providing a golfing environment not typically seen in Indiana. In designing the course, Liddy took advantage of the natural surroundings, mixing wetlands, old-growth forests and some strategically placed rocks to provide plenty of challenge and a picturesque setting. The par-72, 18-hole course is not overly long, playing to only 6,944 yards on Bent grass from the tips, but water comes into play on about half the holes. One of the more noteworthy holes includes No. 2, a par-4 with a large water hazard that must be carried from the back tees. There's also a large fairway bunker on the right to contend with, and a deep, two-tiered green at the finish. Hole No. 3 ups the challenge - a par-5 that plays to 537 yards from the back tees. The hole features water in front of the tee area, and two more water hazards that run along both sides of the fairway and past a shallow, well-bunkered green. There's not much letup the rest of the way, and the course concludes with one of the best par-4s on the course. The hole plays to 427 yards from the Black tees, and water runs from the teeing area to the green. Any golfers choosing to play the back two tees must hit a tee shot over the hazard as the hole doglegs left around the water. A large sand bunker guards the left side of the fairway on the approach, while trees guard the right. The course has been given a number of awards since opening, including being ranked as one of the Best New Public Courses in America by Golf Digest 1995, and being ranked as the 8th-best Course in America to Play for Under $50 by GOLF Magazine in 2004. Golfweek Magazine also named The Rock'' one of the Best Golf Courses You Can Play in 2009. Practice facilities at the course include a driving range and putting green, as well as a Pro Shop. Lessons are also available, including a Player Development Program. The course also features a newly remodeled, enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion."
"Santa Claus Museum","Indiana","Santa Claus Museum - Santa Claus, Indiana - Where It's Christmas Every Day and Santa Answers Every Letter","Anyone visiting southeastern Indiana with small children - anyone, for that matter, who has a special fascination with Christmas - will want to make a stop in the town of Santa Claus to visit the Santa Claus Museum. This museum, the brainchild of Pat Koch, contains an array of Santa Claus memorabilia, photographs, figurines, and exhibits on the history of the town of Santa Claus. Here kids can write letters to Santa, and expect them to be answered by a letter with a postmark reading Santa Claus.''  They can see one of Santa's sleighs, as well as an exhibit on the life of Pat Koch's father, Jim Yellig, who for fifty years, and with more than 30 appearances in New York City parades, helped to create the concept of children lining up to sit on Santa's lap and tell him their deepest Christmas wishes. The U.S. Postal Service began to send Yellig any letter addressed to Santa that had no more information on it than Santa, USA.'' The town of Santa Claus was renamed from its original Santa Fe in the mid-nineteenth century, and has traded on its unique name since 1914, when Postmaster James Martin began to answer children's letters to Kris Cringle. In 1935, following the postmaster's cue, Milton Harris and the Curtis Candy Company built the town's first attraction: Santa Claus Candy Castle. That same year another entrepreneur, Carl Barrett, created Santa Claus Park. But it was Pat Koch's father, and her father-in-law Louis Koch, who put the town of Santa Claus on the map. They started Santa Claus Land as a free attraction for kids. After Yellig himself became the embodiment of Christmas, Bill and Pat Koch have since turned Santa Claus Land into Holiday World, which these days is a big money-maker, and one of Southern Indiana's largest tourist attractions. Pat Koch over the years had amassed a collection of things Santa Claus, which she wanted to display. Her desire to keep alive the important role of the town in doing good for poor children, led her to found the museum in 2006. Besides history, it sees as part of its mission the spreading of Christmas cheer around the world. From the days of a kindly postmaster answering a few letters, the museum has taken over the duty of organizing an army of volunteer elves to answer the nearly 20,000 letters that arrive for Santa each year. In the spirit of Christmas, the museum charges no admission. Its gift shop includes souvenirs in the spirit of Christmas. Children can receive a letter from Santa by writing to: Santa Claus P.O. Box 1 Santa Claus, IN 47579"
"Santa's Candy Castle: Santa Claus, Indiana's Oldest Attraction","Indiana","Santa's Candy Castle: Santa Claus, Indiana's Oldest Attraction","Santa's Candy Castle is a Santa Claus- and Christmas-themed attraction in the small town of Santa Claus, Indiana. The town is located about 30 miles east of Evansville, Indiana, and is just a few miles from Interstate 64, which runs between Evansville and Louisville, Kentucky. Santa Claus (the town) receives more than one million visitors a year. Recent highway improvements have eased access to both the town and the Candy Castle itself. The town of Santa Claus dates back to 1856, when the U.S. Post Office officially granted the town its name. It wasn't until the mid-1920s, however, that the town became famous. The enterprising Postmaster at the time, James Martin, decided to start promoting the town's unique postmark by having retailers ship their Christmas items from there so that children would receive packages from Santa Claus.'' Children began sending letters to Santa Claus (the person), and, by 1929, the town received so many letters that it was featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not.'' Santa's Candy Castle was built in 1935, when entrepreneur Milton Harris realized his dream of creating a themed attraction around the town's popularity with children at Christmas. The Candy Castle was originally sponsored by the Curtiss Candy Company, the maker of Baby Ruth and Butterfinger. Almost immediately after the castle itself was built, Santa's Workshop and the Toy Village, sponsored by several large American toymakers, sprang to life. Toys were available for children to play with, and no admission was charged. The site claims it was the first themed attraction in the nation. By the 1970s, Santa's Candy Castle was old and run-down. It no longer received many visitors, and by 1975, the attraction had closed. It sat vacant for 30 years, until it was purchased, renovated and reopened in 2006. The attraction itself is still free. Its primary marketing is centered around its candy and confection store, both online and onsite. The store sells fudge and 31 different flavors of candy canes, as well as old-fashioned candies like divinity and caramel corn. The most popular products, according to customer reviews, however, are the hot chocolate and frozen chocolate mixes. The owner of the Candy Castle, Kevin Klosowski, says, I thought it would be cool to fill the moat with hot chocolate.'' Apparently, the local health inspector disagreed. One room in the castle now features a historical display related to the town's postal past, including letters to Santa and Ripley's Believe It or Not paraphernalia. Only the Candy Castle reopened in 2006; Klosowski plans to reopen Santa's Workshop and the Toy Village as he is able to remodel them. The town offers many other Christmas-themed attractions now, and families can find plenty to entertain themselves. Customer reviews on several websites are mostly ecstatic, based on young children's reactions. One woman exclaims, The look in my children's eyes ... was priceless!'' Even adults are fascinated: I thought I was going to visit a cheesy tourist stop but ... what I found was an incredible piece of history.'' Perhaps Santa's Candy Castle is best summed up a young reviewer from kidsknowstuff.com, who says, It's just like Christmas!''"

"Snite Museum in South Bend, Indiana","Indiana","Snite Museum in South Bend, Indiana","The Snite Museum is located on the campus of the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The University of Norte Dame was founded in 1842, by Father Edward Sorin of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. From the very inception of the college, art has played an extremely important part. Father Sorin brought a Vatican artist to the campus, and for the next seventeen years, the artist painted the interior of the Golden Dome, the Columbus Murals, and the murals within the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. In 1975, the Fred Snite family donated money for the construction of the Snite Museum of Art. The museum first opened its doors in 1980, bringing together the O'Shaughnessy Art Gallery and the Mestrovic Sculpture Studio, which was later converted into a gallery. When the Snite Museum opened, the college was finally able to display rapidly developing art collections, as well as offer other professional art education programs. The collections of the Snite Museum are interpreted by special exhibits, publications and various educational outreach programs. The museum employs two professional educators, one devoted to the Notre Dame faculty and students, and the second focuses on community and the schoolchildren of the community.

"Squire Boone Caverns & Village-Mauckport, IN - Caverns and Village in Southern Indiana","Indiana","Squire Boone Caverns & Village-Mauckport, IN - Caverns and Village in Southern Indiana","It is estimated that there are 2600 caves in Squire Boone Caverns. Each cave has a distinct personality that is alluring to the novice cave explorer interested on a guided tour and the serious spelunker using advanced equipment, crawling in smaller hard to reach spaces and no two caverns are alike. The guided tours offer pristine visions of stalactites formed from decades of limestone rich residue dripping from the cavern ceiling, underground waterfalls and dark tight passages. The soluble limestone that once filled these caverns was removed by years of underground water melting it then washing it away. The result is caverns, caves and the underground chambers found today which remain at a pleasant 54 degree temperature year round. Long sleeves or a light weight jacket is encouraged when touring the caves. Inside the cavern is a path that covers a deep pit that lies at the end of a beautiful cascading underground waterfall. Cave salamander and crayfish can be seen in the crystal clear water found there. When visiting the caverns be prepared for a physical work out. To reach the caverns there is a stairway containing 73 steel stairs. Once at the bottom the terrain of the cavern is irregular and there are additional smaller stairways that lead to the caverns attractions-the longest one being 20 additional steps. Remember once the tour is complete the trip up to the top is retraced and the 73 steps must be climbed. This is not a tour for the physically impaired. Squire Village named for Daniel Boone's older brother is located minutes from Croydon, Indiana the first state capital in the city of Mauckport. The Boone brothers settled in the area in 1790. Squire Boone discovered and fell in love with the caverns while hiding from the Shawnee. Years later he returned to the area, built his home, mill and continued to spend time in his beloved caverns. His final wish was to be buried in the caves and presently his remains are located in a vault at the end of the cavern tour."

"The Fort Golf Resort, Indianapolis, Indiana - An 18-Hole Championship Golf Course, Redesigned by Pete Dye","Indiana","The Fort Golf Resort, Indianapolis, Indiana - An 18-Hole Championship Golf Course, Redesigned by Pete Dye","The Fort Golf Resort is an 18-hole championship golf course found on 238 secluded acres within Ft. Harrison State Park, but is located just minutes from Indianapolis. The course has received national renown since being redesigned in 1995 by Pete Dye and re-opening in 1997. The course features a varied terrain with significant elevation changes, rolling hills and fairways lined with trees, natural wetlands and large, undulating greens. Golfers can encounter deep ravines at one turn, or wide fairways lined with mature forests at others. The green complexes are also varied, with some guarded by grassy swales and deep bunkers, or open fronts that allow for bump-and-run play. The course also features more than 50 sand bunkers, as well as a creek that crosses the fairways on several holes. The par-72 design plays to 7,148 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.4 and a slope rating of 139. Because of the elevation changes, golfers may find themselves thinking twice about club selection when hitting from elevated tees or approaching elevated greens. In addition, it's not uncommon to encounter a hole that looks open but plays narrower than it appears from the tee.  The greens tend to be medium-sized and undulating, with some double-tiered, and well-bunkered on every hole. Golfers playing from the White tees may want to change up and play from the Blues on some holes that feature elevated tees. This includes holes No. 11 and No. 18, where playing from the short White tees can actually make for an uphill tee shot. No. 11 is a par-5 that ranks as the #2 handicap-hole, and plays to 523 yards from the Bues, and 480 yards from the White tees. No. 18 is a par-4 that plays to 426 yards from the Blue tees and 390 from the White. Other interesting holes include No. 2 and No. 10, both par-4s that play to less than 300 yards from the White tees. Another unique Pete Dye feature is the back-to-back par-5s, Nos. 6 and 7. These two holes are considered a good scoring opportunity, although the tee shot on No. 7 can be a bit daunting. The course has received a number of honors and accolades since re-opening, including being awarded 4? stars by Golf Digest Places to Play, and being ranked the #1 public course in Indiana by Golfweek Magazine. Practice facilities include a large, targeted grass driving range, putting green and short-game area with sand bunkers. Private and group golf lessons are also available.  The resort also features a full-service clubhouse with a fully stocked Golf Shop, locker rooms, and The Garrison Restaurant. The restaurant is open daily for a luncheon buffet and offers dinner on weekends and various holidays, with dining and ballroom seating up to 400. Lodging is also available in the Harrison House, which has seven suites, or in the three fully furnished Officer's Homes, which feature three bedrooms, two sofa beds and 2.5 baths. In addition to golf, guests can take advantage of four miles of hiking trails and 2.5 miles of asphalt shared by walkers, bicyclists and in-line skaters. A saddle barn located within the park also offers trail rides, and there's also picnicking, fishing and other nature activities to be found within the parkland."

"The Roofless Church: New Harmony's Architectural Gem","Indiana","The Roofless Church: New Harmony's Architectural Gem","The Roofless Church is an architectural monument designed by renowned architect Philip Johnson. The non-denominational church is in New Harmony, Indiana, a small community about 20 miles northwest of Evansville. It was commissioned by Jane Blaffer Owen, a New Harmony resident passionate about preserving nature. Johnson and Owen envisioned a church where the only roof large enough to encompass a world of worshippers was the sky. The church was dedicated in 1960 and is maintained by the Episcopal Diocese of Indiana. Today, in addition to being a tourist attraction, the Roofless Church is a popular site for weddings and other sacred ceremonies. The church is an open park surrounded by a brick wall. At one end of the park is a dome covered in cedar shingles, shaped in folds that look somewhat like draped cloth. Some interpret the shape as an inverted rosebud, and it is said that the structure casts the shadow of an open rose. The rose was the symbol of the utopian community that founded the town. Although a Biblical quotation on the structure mentions the rose, there is no evidence that the architect intended it to resemble, or cast the shadow of, an actual rose. At the top of the dome is an oculus, or round opening. Under the dome is a statue, also commissioned by Owen, by Joseph Lipschitz. At the end of the enclosed park is a balcony that looks out onto open farmland. New Harmony was founded by the Harmony Society, a group of Germans who separated from the Lutheran Church and moved to America after being persecuted in Germany. They settled in Indiana in 1814, espousing pacifism, abolition and a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The Harmonists left Indiana in 1824 and sold the land to the Welsh social reformer Robert Owen. Owen also attempted to form a utopian society in the town. Jane Owen, distantly related to Robert Owen by marriage, first came to the town in the 1940s. Many of the structures in New Harmony were virtually untouched, and Owen determined that she would preserve and enhance the town. The Roofless Church is significant not only for its historic location, however, but for the prominence of its architect. Philip Johnson was one of the most important figures in 20th-century American architecture. As the primary proponent of the International Style, he was responsible for the glass and steel structure of many of the country's most famous skyscrapers, including the Seagram Building in New York City, which he designed with Mies van der Rohe. He eventually tired of the International Style's rigid formalism and started working just in glass. Two of his most famous glass structures are the Glass House, his own residence in New Canaan, Connecticut, and the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. The Roofless Church is a minor work in the architect's oeuvre, although the walled space does call to mind Johnson's fondness for the enclosed medieval garden. As for the domed structure itself, there is nothing else like it in his work."
"The Trophy Club","Indiana","The Trophy Club, Lebanon, Indiana - An Links-Style Golf Course That's Been Rated the #1 Public Course in the State","The Trophy Club is a links-style course that features Bent grass fairways, 100 finely sculpted sand bunkers, as well as numerous ponds, lakes and creeks, along with tall, native Blue grass and Fescue grasses that outline the manicured playing surfaces. Water hazards come into play on 8 of the 18 holes, and the greens tend to be undulating and large. Built to USGA specifications, the greens are often raised and surrounded by bunkers, mounds, collection areas and swales. The par-72 course plays to a daunting 7,317 from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 75.3 and a slope rating of 138. The course is a Tim Liddy design that opened in 1998 and covers 247 acres. The layout plays through rolling terrain and Prairie Creek winds throughout the facility. Even though the course features 100 bunkers, with a few notable exceptions, they are not deep and tend to be more of a nuisance rather than a penalty to most golfers. The fairways also tend to be wide at 60 yards and fairly forgiving. The course has received a number of accolades, including being ranking the #1 Public Golf Course in Indiana by Golf Digest 2007-2008. The magazine also gave The Trophy Club a 4? -star rating and ranked it the 4th-best New Public Course in America when it opened. The course has also hosted the 2001 Indiana PGA Senior Championship, the 1999 Indianapolis Open and the 1999 Indiana PGA Senior Open, to name a few. The course has been called a gem,'' but, in spite of all the honors and accolades, it still tends to fly somewhat under the radar for many golfers. It's been reported that golfers can pay under $50 to play the course on most days and times. Some of the more noteworthy holes include the par-4 No. 1, which plays to a lengthy 483 yards. The hole features two deep bunkers - which will have golfers thinking of British Open courses, should they happen to be at the bottom of these walled traps - that guard the green. Another noteworthy hole is No. 13, another lengthy par-4 at 481 yards and the #2-handicap hole on the course. This hole features a narrow entry to the green, as well as bunkers and a creek that guards the right and rear of the green. The Trophy Club also features practice facilities that include a large, targeted grass range, as well as a short-game area and practice green. Golf instruction is also available, and the club features a clubhouse with a nicely stocked Pro Shop. The Hogan Grill and Bar can also be found in the clubhouse, and serves hot and cold sandwiches and beverages. For outings and events, the clubhouse Pavilion Room can accommodate up to 180 people."

"Wana Waves Splash Universe","Indiana","Wana Waves Splash Universe - Shipshewana, Indiana - Indoor Water Park and Resort with Entertainment","Wana Waves Splash Universe, an indoor water park resort with over 100,000 gallons of water in use, is open year-round. It was voted best area attraction in Indiana Water Parks. Located in the heart of Amish country, at 800 South Van Buren Street, near the famous 105 plus shops at Shipshewana, there is ample opportunity to enjoy Amish home-style cooking at the park's Shipshewana Clear Spring Restaurant, a part of the Blue Gate Restaurant family. Additionally, the resort features the Ice Creamery and Soda Shoppe and the water park has, for lunch and snacking purposes, the Snack Barn. When guests check in at the resort, featuring 154 themed guest rooms and suites, they are given free hot-buttered popcorn. The resort features the Shooting Star Arcade, with over 60 state-of-the-art games, which pay out tickets that can be redeemed for a variety of prizes. There is a Marionette show at the Mousetrap Puppet Theatre for both children and adults to enjoy. The Splash Crafts Country Store sells Splash Universe Resort souvenirs. Although the resort is open year-round, there are some days that the indoor water park closes like many of the area parks, so it is recommended that visitors call in advance to obtain the Shipshewana indoor water park schedule. Wana Waves Splash Universe is open daily at 9am, with the exception of scheduled closings, closing at 9pm on weekdays when school is in session and at 10pm otherwise. The indoor water park is composed of dual vortex water slides, the Floating Lily Pad Walk, an indoor river grotto known as the Ripplin' River, the Zero entry Lil' Squirt Pool, and a seven-level jungle gym play fort with a 500-gallon tipping bucket. Riding the water slides on double inner tubes, people actually go outside of the building and back in again. To cross the Lily Pad Walk is a challenge that requires use of overhead ropes and crossing of floating log jams. The Ripplin' River is the equivalent of a lazy river where people float on inner tubes. Specifically for the parents, there is an adult-only hot tub available in a more private area. The water park also offers a family spa. The park is kept at 84 degrees Fahrenheit so that it always feels like summer, which guests describe as the perfect temperature. To best experience the water park resort, visitors suggest eating at the restaurants instead of bringing food for the family based on taste, convenience and affordability. One resort guest was particularly pleased with Wana Waves as they were allowed to check in early on arrival and to check out late as to allow the family extra time for enjoying Splash Universe. People who have stayed at the resort caution that regardless of party size, each reservation includes only four passes to the water park, so guests should be prepared to pay an additional $15.00 per pass for additional guests."
"Warren Golf Course, Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana - A Contemporary Golf Course With an Old-Fashioned, Traditional Design","Indiana","Warren Golf Course, Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana - A Contemporary Golf Course With an Old-Fashioned, Traditional Design","The Warren Golf Course is an 18-hole championship design by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw that opened to public play in 2000. The course features what has been described as old-fashioned, traditional golf'' set amid 250 acres of secluded, rolling terrain in the northeast corner of the Notre Dame campus. Rather than creating a course that looked modern'' and new, the goal was to build a new course that looked like it had been in existence for some time. The course plays to 6,744 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 131, but it also has a rather unique feature: even though the course is listed as a par-71 course, there is no official par'' for the course, with only the yardage listed on each hole. Instead, players are allowed to determine what's par, depending on the weather and terrain conditions. Another interesting feature is the use of Fescue grass not only for the roughs, but in the fairways as well. The use of Fescue is said to add to the individuality of the course and length off the tee, while allowing for the option of playing bump-and-run shots, rather than just flying the ball to the green. It also requires a lesser amount of chemicals in its maintenance, which makes the course more environmentally friendly. The course features a good mix of open fairways and others that are tight and lined by trees. There are also 86 sand bunkers and they tend to penalize rather than merely distract. One of the Warren Course's distinctive features is its bunkering, with traps that tend to have high lips which can make escape shots a bit tricky. Water also comes into play quite often, as the course incorporates two lakes as well as Juday Creek in its layout. The green complexes are undulating and usually will feature a few sand hazards. Slopes are also not uncommon around the greens, making a solid short game essential for good scoring on this course. While not overly long in total - a mere 6,346 yards from the middle tees - many golfers will find length a problem on this course, due to its five par-4s that all play between 415 and 443 yards. That makes driver a necessary club, but the longer holes compensate by providing ample landing areas and well-manicured fairways. One of the signature holes on the course is the 345-yard No. 16. The tee shot begins on an elevated green with a forced carry across Juday Creek to an uphill, dogleg left fairway. There are a number of challenging bunkers along the left side, and the approach shot must find a small, undulating green guarded by bunkers. The course also features some extensive practice facilities, including a grass range, putting green and short-game area with sand bunker. The course also features a 7,000-square-foot clubhouse with a pro shop and the Warren Grille restaurant and lounge for food, snacks and beverages. There are also banquet and outing facilities available that can accommodate as many as 120 people."
"Washington Square Mall","Indiana","Washington Square Mall - Evansville, Indiana - Oldest Mall in Southern Indiana","Washington Square Mall has served the Evansville area since the 1960s. When it opened, it was among the first enclosed malls in the state, located adjacent to a noted shopping center, Washington Lawndale Commons, which has been operating since the 1950s. Washington Square Mall's initial anchor department stores were Sears at the north end and Stewart's Dry Goods at the south. During the 1970s and 1980s, when the mall was operating at its peak, its major retailers were joined by 90 other outlets, including L.S. Ayres, Harry Levinson's, The Baby Shoppe, Woolsey's Toys, Burger Farm, and Chess King, to name a few. The mall's history has been punctuated by a number of disappointments. L. S. Ayres closed in 1992 to be replaced Elder-Beerman, which in turn closed in 2002. One of the more recent failures was the 2007 closing of Values Unlimited, a homegrown multi-merchandise retailer that began operating in a portion of the former 140,000-square-foot Elder-Beerman store building in 2004. Competition has been a major cause behind the mall's struggles. The opening of Eastland Mall in 1981 drew many customers and some businesses away. As neighboring Lawndale Commons also lost tenants in the 1990s, the Washington retail corridor became even less of a shopping destination. The Hahn Property Group has managed to keep Sears as the primary attraction here. It occupies 192,000 square feet, ranking it among the largest Sears outlets in the Midwest. It features a gift registry, portrait studio, optical center, and a special Lands' End home shop, along with its own drop-off location and store pick up service. However, recent efforts by Hahn to supplement Sears with another anchor have not been successful. Today, the vacancy rate at Washington Square Mall remains high, despite leasing and licensing offers for as little as $8.00 per square foot. Current businesses operating at Washington Square Mall include retailers, medical offices, and services, such as Dean Webster Insurance and R.L. Voight CPA. The local shops are Brian Smith Photography, Deb, Designs4U, Fast Lane Raceway, Just Cookies, Marion's Hallmark, Old US Coins, Salon 3, and Treasures. Healthcare providers are Evansville Primary Care, Freedom Medical, St. Mary's Senior Health, and St. Mary's Lab and X-Ray. Customers still appreciate the cleanliness and safety of the mall. Many have commented on its centerpiece atrium and water fountain. There is also a food court with limited selections, the most popular choice being Noble Romans for pizza and subs, along with The Potato Place, whose signature menu features fully-loaded baked potatoes and a variety of mouth-watering toppings. Gene Hahn and Paul Kite, the mall owners, have indicated that they have plans to attract new tenants and deliver additional foot traffic to Washington Square. According to their prospectus, We are in the process of bringing an average of 1,500 new customers per day to the mall.'' Operating hours at Washington Square Mall are from 10am to 9pm weekdays, 7am to 9pm on Saturdays and noon to 6pm on Sundays. The address is 1138 Washington Square, Evansville, Indiana 47715."

"WonderLab Museum of Science","Indiana","WonderLab Museum of Science, Health and Technology is a museum for children to learn about science, health and technology","The WonderLab Museum of Science, Health and Technology was started by the inspiration of Debra Kent, a journalist and mother from Bloomington, gathered a small group of like minded people to create a hands-on science museum for children that will stimulate curiosity, encourage exploration and foster lifelong learning. WonderLab originally began as a travelling outreach program with non-profit status and was run by dedicated volunteers. In January 1998 the museum opened a small museum on the north side of the Bloomington courthouse square. Fundraising began at this time also to build a larger permanent museum on the present site, which was donated by the city of Bloomington the previous year. The museum was opened to the public on March 29, 2003 and remains a grassroots organization, which is supported by many volunteers and individuals who have been part of the organization from the beginning. Exhibits in the museum include experiences for all ages including age appropriate adventures for toddlers and preschool children. When visitors enter the gallery they encounter the Cosmic Dance, which is five translucent floor panels that light up when cosmic ray particles hit them. One of the highlights at the museum is the two-storey maze, Grapevine Climber, which has whimsical leaf like pads. Located on the first floor is the Bubble-atrium, which provides and unexpected way of using bubbles. The museum hosts wondercamps during the summer for children to introduce them to the process of scientific inquiry in a relaxed atmosphere. The camp has extensive hands-on activities to help children develop critical thinking and creative strategies. The activities are structured with campers rotating in groups among activity stations, and science experts may visit the camps as a guest. The camps are led by experienced teachers with help from high school interns. Wonderlab is able to visit classrooms and provide demonstrations with hands-on activities that address Indiana Science standards. The lab will provide all materials that are required and are not found in the classroom. These classes include Hanging in the Balance where students make a balance toy or Feel the Noise where students will make a musical instrument. The gift store at the museum has a range of high-quality science toys, games, puzzles, kits, animals and food specialties available for purchase. Gift store certificates and WonderPasses are also available from the gift store along with gift memberships. When an item is purchased from the gift shop it helps to sustain the lab throughout the year as a resource for the community. Some of the exhibits at the museum include the Water Works `Build A Channel' exhibit. In this exhibit visitors will construct dams and channels using Duplo Blocks to discover how water fills to the shape of a container and can slip through a tiny crack. The Mechanical Crane requires teamwork and problem solving skills to stack blocks and then tip the tower over. This exhibit features three control stations, which use belts and pulleys to move the objects. Art Exhibitions are on show at the museum and rotate throughout the year. Before visiting the museum, visitors are able to check the calendar of events on the museums website to know which exhibit is currently happening."
