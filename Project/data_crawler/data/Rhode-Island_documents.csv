It is a monument to Victorian architecture, furnishings and adornments. The building dates back to 1852. It is remembered for the legendary parties it once hosted for thousands of guests. It was constructed for China trade merchant William Shepard Wetmore, who died in 1862. In the 1870s this mansion was remodeled in French style by the renowned architect Richard Morris Hunt.

"Cliff Walk, Newport, RI","Rhode-Island","Cliff Walk, Newport, RI - Newport, Rhode Island - Scenic Sea Cliff Walkway Lies Between Crash of Waves and Mansion Estate Lawns","Cliff Walk, Newport, RI, is a 3.5 mile walkway open to the public that stretches along the eastern shore of this southern New England waterfront city.

Under Rhode Island local law, landowners who hold property traversed by this public attraction are not liable for any injuries that may befall people on the path. This National Recreation Trail runs through a National Historic District. But over the last 150 years local owners frequently clashed with the public over walkway access. Leashed dogs are allowed to accompany their guardians along the Cliff Walk. Bicycles are prohibited on this pathway at all times. Along the Cliff Walk, Newport, RI, it is thought that the first paths were carved out beneath the hooves of deer and later under the feet of the indigenous Narragansett people. Later colonists walked this shoreline salvaging floating wreckage and food sources from the sea here. It was in the late 1800s that the area inland from the Sea Cliffs saw numerous estates constructed in Victorian fashion. In the 1880s, the gradual construction of the walk area began. It was built by the landowners themselves although, after storms destroyed the walk several times, public efforts went into reconstruction. One of the novelties along the Cliff Walk, Newport, RI, aside from the elevated panorama onto the water, is found near the Narragansett Avenue access point where the Forty Steps are found. 40 stone steps move down from the walkway to a lowered observation terrace over the water. Even on hot summer days there is often a cool breeze along the walk way although it is still advisable to carry water along as there are no concessions or other facilities of any kind along the path. It is advisable that the southern section of the walk not be traveled by individuals on their own but rather n groups of two or more persons for safety. Due to the dangerous nature of the trek, it is also ill advised to attempt to rush through this area. While a round trip walk amounts to 7 miles of distance. A bus can be found on a short walk up Bellevue Avenue to speed the return to vehicles parked on street meters or at Easton's Beach. Numerous restaurants and shops can also be found on Bellevue Avenue after taking in the seaside sights of this pathway."

It is at 4820 Old Post Road in a rural area of this small southern New England state. It is found in a town with just over 8,000 inhabitants. Contrary to the name, this is neither a factory nor does it produce or even sell many umbrellas. Rather it is a small farm where various quirky shops can be found with affordable novelty goods, jewelry, handcrafts, clothing, drums, toys and all kinds of stuff from different places, near and far. A local artist has her gallery here and crafts work includes hand blown glass jewelry. This emporium opens from 9 AM to 5 PM daily, although all of the stores may not be open every day, especially during the colder months as much of the business is based on the tourist season at nearby beaches. Aside from the alternative shopping opportunity that a visit here provides, the property, amidst the woods, has garden areas and has always hosted a variety of animals ranging from the average farm inhabitants to peacocks and emus.  The animals have dwindled in recent years due to predatory fisher cats having migrated into the area in recent years. For thirty five cents some food can be purchased to hand feed some of the furry and feathered creatures that still remain. The abundant plant life and petting farm elements make for a low stress, low pressure shopping experience far afield from the modern malls. The Factory'' has been operating here since 1968, when this farm was purchased by Robert Bankel and Evan Nickles.  The antique car sitting alongside the barn may have been here since that time or earlier. The New Beginnings Caf,, formerly the Spice of Life Foods Caf, offers a break from shopping. Spice of Life had been a Rhode Island rarity as there have been few other eateries in the state that specialize in vegetarian cuisine. The new restaurant, which took over in late 2006, does not maintain the Spice of Life vegetarian tradition as it serves chicken and tuna on its menu. The Fantastic Umbrella Factory, Charlestown, RI, provides an environment where children can be entertained passing their time as well as adults. The gardens and nurseries, which sell plants, have a broad variety of flora to offer interested gardeners, including the only native New England cactus variety and the Native Wood Lily that no longer can be found naturally growing in New England. The nursery is open from mid April through September. The farmhouse where this marketplace has settled in is said to have been in continual use since 1760. The Fantastic Umbrella Factory, Charlestown, RI, has stayed open for more than 40 years despite a dramatic fire and the turnover in its eclectic community of vendors."

It is on this island that is found 12 miles off the coast of the mainland in the Atlantic Ocean. The island where the gallery is found is accessible by private yacht or by ferry from Point Judith as well as Montauk and Newport in the busy season. Cars may be brought across on the ferry or left on the main land by visitors coming to the gallery. Greenaway's photos on display at the gallery are pictorial renderings of many of the island's most beautiful and secluded locations. Greenaway has been photographing island scenes that appear here at the gallery for more than 30 years. In 1993, Greenaway opened his own gallery space having had his work previously on display at another gallery on the island. Malcolm Greenaway Gallery, Block Island, RI, sells prints of the artist's photographs that he himself develops digitally here since the year 2000. Most of his prints are ordered from New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts although the gallery does receive orders from around the US and even internationally. In 2009, the artist published a book of his photos that is on sale at the Gallery and at the Island Bookstore located on the same street at the Old Harbor as the gallery. Visitors to this gallery should call prior to a visit if it is between Labor Day and Memorial Day as regular hours are only maintained there during the busy months and not throughout the year. As the Gallery is an artist's studio and Gallery space there is no admission charge for entering to view the work on display there. Many consider the photos at the Gallery to be taken by a photographer who has outstripped all others in capturing the diverse island scenes on camera in the most true to life way. The Malcolm Greenaway Gallery, Block Island , RI, collection of photos do not capture the streets busy with tourists, as they are during the day on summer weekends. They capture the desolate nature and even hardship that islanders feel in the icy winter through the lens of the soul of the gallery's owner. Ships offloading from the ferry in the snow, shadows in the clouds above the ocean, eerie afternoon lighting at the Mohegan Bluffs are just a few of the images on display and available in prints from the gallery as well as sunsets from Sandy Point. Perhaps a hundred photos or more were taken by the artist and discarded in the search to capture each one of the images on display here. The photographs on display at the gallery give island visitors an insight into the surroundings that they are visiting that will go beyond what they are likely to see on a weekend outing. It also may provide images they wish to buy to remind them of a few glimpses they are lucky enough to get during their stay."

This island is found some 12 miles off the Atlantic coast of the mainland USA. The beach can be reached by car via the ferry that departs from Point Judith, RI. It can also be reached by moped, bike, or on foot. It is on the eastern side of the island. This beach got its name as it once sat below the view of the island's largest residence. It could be seen atop the hill above the cliffs that back section of the beach. The mansion can no longer be seen from the beach however, since it burned to the ground and was never rebuilt. Some of the building's stone walls remain standing above this beach. This White sandy beach is the biggest beach of the 17 miles of sandy shore found at this island resort. It is also very popular so although there is parking available, to get a space on weekends during the summer one should arrive early. There are no concession stands so one is advised to bring refreshments and water along. This is not a good beach for small children due to strong surf. It is however ideal for the larger kids with boogie boards or for body surfing. Mansion Beach, Block Island, is a public beach. There is no charge for admission. This beach is traditionally traversed during the running leg of the Annual Block Island Triathalon that is organized on the island in July by the Block Island Recreation department. Like many of the island's beaches, this beach is ideal for building sandcastles as well as beachcombing and simply taking a hike or a run along the lapping surf.

Within just a few miles of this beach there are numerous bed & breakfasts and summer cottages available for vacationers wishing to stay the night or longer near this sandy section of shoreline so close to town. Mansion Beach, Block Island, is just north of Scotch Beach and just South of Clayhead, the reddish cliffs seen when arriving on the ferry to the island. The red comes from the rich deposits of clay and iron in the soil there. This is a good place for shell and rock collecting for people wishing to walk from Mansion Beach up toward the northernmost part of the island. The temperature at this beach and on the island rarely goes above 90 degrees Fahrenheit, staying cooler than the mainland beaches in the summer."
"Mill Street Inn","Rhode-Island","Mill Street Inn","The Mill Street Inn occupies a special place in local history. It sits upon the foundation of a woodworking shop that dates back to the early 1800s. When a fire destroyed the original building in 1890, the current red brick structure was erected.

The bluffs can be reached by car if it is brought to the island by ferry or on moped, walking, driving or bicycling along the road that passes by the 250 step wooden staircase down to the beach below. Parking is extremely limited on the roadside and there are no lots here. The 150-200 ft. high bluffs stretch for approximately four miles of the island's coastline. This is definitively the most isolated beach in the busy season, particularly in early morning and evening hours. There is pristine white sand with only sand dollars and other sea life washing up as well as some occasional granite boulders along the shore lines. The sharp rise of the bluffs from the beach is a rare sight to see from any of the beaches of New England. Several picnic tables and benches can be found here as well as garbage receptacles. The beach affords a view of the lighthouse above, a side view of the bluffs stretching further along the coast above the beach, and of course the crashing waves. The breeze from the Atlantic keeps the beach and the bluffs above cool and pleasant even when it is fairly hot on the other side of the island, which is more frequented by swimmers. Swimming is allowed in the waters at the Bluff's beaches. The Southeast Light, sitting atop the Mohegan Bluffs, Block Island, RI, is today a museum that can be entered for a small fee. It was built in 1874 and stands 67 ft. tall. In 1993 the weight of the Lighthouse and the natural erosion on the bluffs forced it to be hydraulically moved back some 350 feet on a rail installed for that purpose to prevent it from sliding down the Bluffs and crashing onto the beach below. There is no pedestrian beach access from the lighthouse area and scaling the face of the Bluffs is prohibited both due to the danger and in order to maintain the beautiful environment and habitat that they provide for local wildlife. The Mohegan Bluffs, Block Island, RI beach is not accessible to wheelchairs or people out of shape that are unable to scale the 250 steps back up to the road at the end of their visit. There are no concessions or restrooms on this quiet beach. The water is very clean although never very warm. For swimmers that must have warm water to bathe in this is not the place to come. However the views here are unique and the sound of the ocean, at full force on this island that is 12 miles out to sea, provides a formidable soundtrack."

Among the birds found here are the federally protected Piping Plovers as well as Osprey and dozens of others. Prior to 1815 Napatree was far from the sandy environment it is today. It was covered with trees. That year however the worst hurricane to hit New England struck the area and is said to have literally stripped it bear. After that the beach and dune environment that there is today began to develop. A US fort, Fort Mansfield, was built at the end of Napatree in 1898. It was one of several built to defend the Long Island Sound. After WWI it was abandoned. Later, a series of cottages were built here with a yacht club and minimal resort facilities but in the 1930s they were destroyed. Today the Conservancy and the town are committed to preserving the natural habitat that has evolved here."

This lighthouse is on the National Parks Service Inventory of Historic Light Stations. It is the first Rhode Island lighthouse to have had a radio beacon installed. It was installed in 1931 but in 1974 the radio towers were removed. Since 1954 the light is automated. The Point Judith Lighthouse, RI is not open to the public although its grounds are open during day hours.  This is one of numerous Rhode Island lighthouses that are still in service today.

Its white light illuminates in a specific pattern of 5 seconds on, 2 seconds off, 2 seconds on, 2 seconds off, 2 seconds on again and 2 seconds off before the pattern starts anew. Its light is said to be visible for some 16 miles of distance. In the year 2000, the lighthouse had its first big renovations carried out after a century, which included the repairs to the light itself, which was removed from its home. An interim light was put in its place during a four month period which was required to complete the repair work and restore the lantern to its place. Three supporting buildings still stand on the lighthouse grounds. Those are the fog signal house, the radio beacon building and the oil house. The oldest structure at the sight is the lighthouse tower itself. The Point Judith Lighthouse, RI is a point of interest on several sightseeing cruises on the Bay. Views of the lighthouse in the distance are also visible from the Block Island Ferry. The lighthouse has appeared on various postcards and has received mention in numerous books on historic lighthouses in the US.

This is one of the 6 neighborhoods that form eastern Providence. To its west lies the downtown. It is a street and a neighborhood often written about in the works of Providence's son and author, H.P. Lovecraft. In the 1960s this street was the city's hub of the counterculture for the hippies and in the 1990s it was home to the grunge scene. Then and now this street is frequented by Brown University students as it is but a stone's throw from the campus. Some of the graduate student housing for Brown can be found here on Thayer. The street has thus been a magnet for quirky shops of vintage clothing, music and other items targeting the college crowd of Brown Students and students from the nearby School of Design (RISD). A handful of name brand stores have opened but most of the businesses continue to be of local character where browsing is encouraged. The Brown University Bookstore is also located on Thayer, as are a few buildings used for Brown classroom spaces. Many of the shops and retail stores that historically populated the street have been shutting down or moving in recent years however, while more and more restaurants appear. Affordable slices of pizza, coffee shop fare, Greek, Asian and Mediterranean foods are all among the varied dining options on Thayer and its neighboring streets. Some of the bargain food joints have yielded to higher prices in recent years. The large number of restaurants makes parking difficult most times of the day and night here.
