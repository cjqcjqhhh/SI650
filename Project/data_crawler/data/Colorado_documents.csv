"Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado In Need of Repairs","Colorado","Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado In Need of Repairs","The Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs is one of the nation's unique buildings. It was designed by Walter Netsch Jr. who, unfortunately, passed away in his home in Chicago at the age of eighty-eight this past July. The chapel is a wonder of modern architecture and this is quite a feat since it was built in 1962. The dominant feature of the chapel is the seventeen spires that reach more than one-hundred feet into the sky. Many observers believe the spires resemble the wing from a jet craft placed on its end. Each spire is seventy-five feet long and weighs nearly five tons. There is a space in between each spire that is filled with stained glass. The Chapel cost $3.5 million dollars to build. The organ, religious artifacts, furnishings, pipe fittings, and decorative hangings were all purchased with money collected at USAF services and by private donations. The building was commissioned by the Unites States Air Force to be a multi-denominational place of worships for the Air Force cadets housed in Colorado Springs. Walter Netsch Jr. certainly delivered just that as there are five distinct places of worship within the chapel: Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Buddhist and an all-faiths room. Each place of worship is designed with that particular faith's beliefs in mind. The all-faiths room is devoid of religious paraphernalia so it will be acceptable to people of various religions. Removable accoutrements are allowed to be brought into the all-faiths room for worship services. The chapel reached National Historic Landmark status in 2004. The American Institute of Architects named the chapel the 51st most popular building in the country in 2007. The Chapel was not always viewed with such awe. According to Mr. Netsch's widow, Dawn, many people felt the chapel was not religious enough and many others felt it was just downright weird. According to Duane Boyle, Air Force Chief of Program Development, the chapel has fallen on hard times. Leaks have developed between the spires due to cost restraints on materials imposed on Mr. Netsch. These leaks require constant attention and repair and cost upwards of $300,000 dollars in annual repairs. Due to the National Historic Landmark status of the chapel it, by law, cannot be demolished so repairs should commence soon. The town of Colorado Springs is also welcome to tour, or worship in, the chapel. The town is dependant on the Air Force base for much of its economy and lives in harmony with its cadet neighbors. The mean salary in Colorado Springs is slightly over fifty thousand dollars and the mean price for a home is $209,400 dollars. This makes Colorado Springs one of the most affordable places in Colorado to purchase a home."
"Alluvial Fan","Colorado","Alluvial Fan - Rocky Mountain National Park, CO - a fan shaped deposit in the Rocky Mountain National Park","The Rocky Mountain National Park has a fan shaped deposit that was formed by the flowing of streams the flattened, slowed and spread at the exit to the canyon onto the flatter plain. Lawn Lake which is at an elevation of eleven thousand feet was originally just over sixteen acres until a twenty-foot earthen dam was built on it during 1902. This increased the capacity for water in the lake to approximately 257 million gallons. The water was usually released from the dam into the Big Thompson and Fall River at Estes Park using the Roaring Fork River channel. The water in the lake was used to irrigate the land around it. The damn was neglected due to the remote area that it was in which is believed to have led to its eventual erosion. The dam at the Lawn Lake broke on July 15, 1982 at 6:30am and released an estimated 228 million gallons of water. The channel of the river overflowed carrying boulders and trees with it as it went down the side of the mountain. The Aspenglen had to be evacuated when the dam broke. The dam at Cascade Lake which was concrete and seventeen feet high failed when the water hit it and released another four million gallons of water onto the mounting. When the flooding from the Lawn Lake was done there was a scar five miles long where the flood had went down the mountain. This scar ends at Horseshoe Park with a large fan shaped deposit made up of broken trees, boulders and silt. This is what is known as the Alluvial Fan in the Rocky Mountain National Park. The debris that formed the Alluvial Fan created a shallow wetland and lake called Fan Lake when it created a damn in the Fall River. The flooding that created the Alluvial Fan in Colorado's Rocky Mountain National Park did over thirty million dollars worth of damage both in and around the town of Estes Park, Colorado which is adjacent to the park. The fan formed when the waters from the lake slowed down and spread out where the Horseshoe Park is bordered by the Fall River and a large area of fanned out debris was left behind to form a fan shape in the landscape. This area is now a tourist attraction of the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. The Alluvial Fan left behind at the Horseshoe Park and the scars left on the land are still present. There is a trail known as the Alluvial Fan Trail that takes visitors to the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado to see the Alluvial Fan formation. Visitors to the Rocky Mountains and the surrounding area have a number of site seeing options making it an ideal place to visit. There are numerous trails in the Rocky Mountain National Park for visitors to explore and they should make it a point to explore the Alluvial Fan Trail and see the natural wonder that is the Alluvial Fan."

"Bishop Castle","Colorado","Bishop Castle - Westcliffe, CO - one man's dream come true","Bishop Castle is a three story castle that has been being constructed in a medieval style since 1969. Jim Bishop is building the structure and refers to it as a Disneyland for the poor man. The native stone that makes up the majority of the castle was obtained from the San Isabel National Forest and intricate iron work is featured in the building. The design and the building have all been done by Bishop in an effort to fulfill his dream of having a castle. The public can go to the top of the 160 foot tall spire of Bishop Castle. The top is reached through the combination of open iron platforms and spiral staircases. There are hallways, staircases, rooms and even a grand hall featuring stained glass and wooden floors in the structure. A dragon head that produces propane flames is on the front of the peaked roof of the Bishop Castle. Bishop is hopeful that the castle will be complete before he dies although he has to deal with local officials that constantly claim the structure is unsafe and is being built illegally. Jim Bishop has personally gotten and set over a thousand tons of rock each year since 1969 in order to create the Bishop Castle. Bishop feels that everyone wants a castle and continues to build despite problems with Washington bureaucrats that would like to charge him by the truckload for the rocks that he has taken from the surrounding property which is San Isabel National Forest. The Bishop Castle was not listed on the official tourism guides as an attraction because of the refusal from the Chamber of Commerce in Colorado. Now both of these have decided that Bishop Castle is marketable and that he turned unwanted rock into something useful. Even though Jim Bishop has been working on Bishop Castle for the past few decades the inside is still virtually a shell with ornamental ironwork and cemented rocks. There are plans to include a drawbridge over a moat, a balcony large enough to accompany an orchestra and have a roller coaster attached to the outer wall of the castle. Jim even plans to build his wife Phoebe her own castle. By the year 2005 there was the addition of a metal mesh done on Bishop Castle's top that rotates as visitors go into it. Children at the facility are required to be accompanied by an adult. Adult visitors to the castle have to sign the guest book which acts as a waiver of liability for Bishop in the event that something happens while you on the premises. There is no charge for admission to the castle which is open during the hours of daylight. The facility can be found twenty-eight miles to the South East of Westcliffe, Colorado. When traveling to Bishop Castle from Pueblo use 96 west to 165 and turn south onto it; from here simply follow the signs. Anyone in the area of Westcliffe, Colorado should make it a point to visit Bishop Castle which although still unfinished is amazing."

Boreas Pass Road was originally the Breckenridge Pass during the 1860's. It was a route used by prospectors during the gold rush that were crossing from South Park in search of gold in the Blue valley around Breckenridge. It was widened to enable stagecoaches to use it during 1866 and during 1882 there were narrow gauge tracks laid on the pass. The pass was renamed Boreas by Sidney Dillion who had supervised the track lying to honor the Greek god of North Wind. Boreas Pass Road is a dirt road that spans six miles and was once the home of the narrow gauge tracks that were laid.

An intermediate ride can be enjoyed on the single track which goes back to the dirt road near the parking lot. Ken's Cabin and Section House are also found on the Boreas Pass. Section House was constructed during 1882 as a place for railroad families that cared for the railway that was used to go over Boreas Pass. Ken's Cabin which was first build during the 1860's is beside Section House. The original name of Ken's Cabin was Wagon Cabin and is one of the Breckenridge area's oldest buildings. Wagon Cabin and the Section House nearly fell apart with the abandonment of Boreas Pass Road during the 1930's. In 1993 Colorado's Historic Society partnered with the US Forest Service to refurbish them. The building had been completely restored by 1996.

All the nines are Jack Nicklaus signature courses, and provide a mountain-golf experience at an elevation of more than 9,300 feet above sea level, where a golf ball flies farther and straighter than at lower elevations. Stunning views of the Colorado Rockies are visible on every hole, and the courses feature dense woodlands, as well as more open native grasslands and wetlands. Wildlife abounds and it's not uncommon to see beaver, elk, deer, red fox and red-tail hawks, along with the occasional moose or bear. The Bear Course was the first to open in 1985 and offers golfing challenges not unlike what the gold-seeking miners experienced on the land many years earlier. Neither the gold nor the low scores are easy to come by, even though the Bear Course has the most open feel. Holes 7, 8 and 9, in particular, are some of the most challenging to be found, and also offer some of the most notable views of the Ten-Mile mountain range. The Beaver Course was the next to open in 1987, and features the narrowest, most-demanding fairways of the three courses. There are still tailings'' - leftover rock piles, as the miners called them - visible on holes 6, 7 and 8, as well as the beaver ponds for which the course takes its name. There are also elevation changes and swirling breezes to contend with, adding to the already significant challenges found on this nine. Golfers can choose from four sets of tees to suit a challenge equal to their game. For golfers choosing the Nicklaus tees on the Beaver/Bear rotation, the par-72 course plays 7,279 yards, with a course rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 147, making for one of the most difficult courses in the state. Since opening, Breckenridge Golf Club has received a number of awards and accolades, including Best Mountain Course'' and Toughest Mountain Course'' by Colorado Golfer newspaper. Golf Digest magazines rates Breckenridge as a 4 1/2 Star Facility and one of their top Upscale Places to Play'' in the nation.

The builders of the home, Mr. and Mrs. William Newton Byers built the home and lived there for six years. He was the publisher of the Rocky Mountain News, which is still in operation today.

This Park is located at the foot of the Green Mountain, and has 40 acres of land. It is a historic district that offers special programs, concerts, and lectures to its visitors. Started on July 4, 1898, the Colorado Chautauqua was only one of about 12,000 other Chautauquas throughout the United States. Their goal was to present to Americans common cultural and educational experiences. This was accomplished through a number of traveling performers, orators, and educators who went from Chautauqua to Chautauqua in a circuit. President Theodore Roosevelt once referred to them as the most American thing in America. The Chautauqua in Boulder is one of the only three that remain in the United States, and it is the only one west of the Mississippi River. On the property of the Chautauqua, a number of buildings have been preserved and are currently in use continuing the mission of the Chautauqua - still bringing in performers, musicians, and lovers of the arts perform to live audiences. More than 50,000 people come each year to enjoy the programs - the concerts, the films, and the lectures. There is an ongoing schedule of performances throughout the year, and guests of the Park can see them do what they love to do best - perform. The Colorado Music Festival is proud to be a partner of The Chautauqua for over 30 years. The Auditorium is a favorite of performers around the country and is rated as being one of the ten best because of its ease to be heard in it. One great event is the Valentine Getaway Package. This includes tickets for two to stay in a cottage, an opportunity to hear several concerts, and dining hall certificates. Complimentary champagne and chocolates come with it, too. Children can also have a great time because some of the events are just for them. Some programs are designed to present nature themes to the children, in which they will have an interactive part.

"Cheesman Park","Colorado","Cheesman Park, Denver, CO - Park","A very popular park in the heart of Denver, CO is called the Cheesman Park. This park has been around for a long time and is a favorite of many of the wealthier neighbors who live around it. The Park dates back to around the turn of the century and was officially named in 1907. The present borders of the park are, however, somewhat unclear in places even today. It lies next to the Denver Botanic Gardens. Walter Cheesman owned the property that included the land where Cheesman Park is now, the land of the Denver Botanical Gardens, and also the land of the Congress Park. At the time, it was the Prospect Hill Cemetery, which was largely disused. The cemetery was loosely divided into several sections, and each group was largely responsible for their own section - which was neglected. This Park has an interesting history and still there are a number of questions unanswered. After a while, it was discovered that the cemetery's land was actually owned by the government through a treaty with the Arapaho Indians. This meant that the bodies would have to be removed - within 90 days. In the process, a scandal was discovered. The contractor was cheating on how much he was charging and other problems. This resulted in thousands of bodies never being moved - they are still buried on the land of both Cheesman Park and also underneath the Denver Botanical Gardens. A lot of grave robbing was also known to have taken place. The beautiful pavilion that stands on the park grounds is also believed to have covered up bodies, as well. Anyway, some of the first people in the cemetery were known to be criminals and had been hanged. This has resulted in many tales of hauntings over the years. In fact, the film The Changeling is based on some of these reported experiences. A large part of the park is open space and this makes it the ideal place for walking, sports, or other activities. The trail around the park is gravel. It is the perfect place for jogging, walking, picnicking, and sports. A children's playground is also available. For those who go to the park, they will find that it provides an excellent view of the region. Visitors can see Pike's Peak and Mt. Evans, as well as other beautiful mountains and other sights. After you have been to Cheesman Park in Denver, CO, you have opportunity to see many other places that are really great for the whole family. This includes the Denver Botanical Gardens, which are right next door. There are many different gardens here and exotic plants from all over the world. One of the gardens is a replica of One that was at Mount Vernon - George Washington's home. When you get hungry, there are a number of restaurants and fast food places in the neighborhood - which is also called Cheesman Park.

"Colorado National Monument in Colorado is Perfect for Hiking and Wildlife Viewing","Colorado","Colorado National Monument in Colorado is Perfect for Hiking and Wildlife Viewing","	Located in southwest Colorado near the city of Grand Junction, the Colorado National Monument is a semi-desert area of the Colorado Plateau. Designated a National Monument in 1911, it spans about 20,000 acres and, according to the National Park Service, attracts about three-quarters of a million visitors each year. These steep-walled red canyons were first explored in depth around the turn of the twentieth century by John Otto, who dredged trails and made the canyon accessible to visitors. He and others in the region rallied for the park to become a national monument, and when it did, Otto became the first park ranger. Because of Otto's work, guests have enjoyed the park's colorful formations and huge monoliths for nearly a century. Many visitors head to Colorado National Monument for the excellent hiking opportunities available. Hikes range from just a quarter-mile to more than 8 miles. Many are quite easy and provide good looks at some of the park's most famous formations, such as Wedding Canyon and Independence Monument. The more rigorous trails involve large changes in elevation and take hikers to The Kissing Couple and other harder-to-reach formations. Some are best accomplished as multi-day trips and camping is permitted in the back country. Many of the trails are also suitable for horseback riding. The main road through the park, Rim Rock Drive, is available to bicyclists. This 23-mile drive is shared with cars and can be quite strenuous in many spots. Connecting roads may be accessed as well, extending the ride by about 10 miles. Off-road mountain biking is not permitted at the monument but many other national park areas nearby do offer mountain biking opportunities. Climbing is also a popular pursuit among the canyons of the Colorado National Monument. Climbs range from moderate to difficult and many of them are suitable for experienced climbers only. Most of the climbing is accessed from the West entrance of the monument and most of the climbs are of the crack climbing variety. There are also some bolted routes and local outfitters offer guided climbs for both novice and experienced climbers. The Visitor Center at Colorado National Monument offers maps for trails and climbing as well as an exhibit room, a slide presentation, and an occasional geology presentation.

"Concert Venue Built into Rock Formation","Colorado","Concert Venue Built into Rock Formation","Located just 15 miles from downtown Denver is one of the most widely recognized concert amphitheatres in the United States. It is nestled into the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and surrounded by the red rocks that make the area geologically unique. The amphitheatre is open air and there is nothing like it anywhere else on earth. It was as if nature planned this venue with its two 300-foot monoliths that provide acoustic assistance for performances. These monoliths feature 250 million years worth of fossil imprints from animals and plant life in the area. In many ways, it is like viewing millenniums of natural history while enjoying a concert. The site also features fossil fragments from a 40-foot sea serpent, as well as several flying reptiles, and dinosaur tracks from 160 million years ago. Originally the venue was known as the Garden of Angels. Some of the rock slopes are as great as 90 degrees and other tilt backward. The southern monolith in the amphitheatre is known as Ship Rock. The opposite rock is Creation Rock. Each is taller than Niagara Falls, and there was a time when the venue was listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was the early 1900's when the visionary of Red Rocks first imagined the potential of the location. John Brisben Walker knew a performing arts stage would be a perfect fit for the venue and he proceeded to produce numerous concerts at the location between 1906 and 1910. In 1927, then manager of the Denver Park system, George Cranmer, talked the City of Denver into purchasing Red Rocks from Walker. They paid him just over $54,000 for the site. The city then build on the foundation Walker had begun. In 1947, there was an Easter Sunday Sunrise Service, and ever since then performers the world over have been eager to perform at Red Rocks. Red Rocks is more than a performance amphitheatre. Like everything in Colorado, it is majestic and breathtaking in its scenic capacity. There are trails for hiking and biking, and a visitor center where you can relax and stock up on necessities, and also enjoy a meal at the Ship Rock Grille. The restaurant is open for lunch, brunch on the weekend's a dinner pre-show. The Trading Post Trail is one of two of the area's most popular. It is 1.4 miles long and takes hikers through rock formations, meadows, and valleys. Hiking can be rough and weather can be sporadic, so preparing accordingly. The trail is over 6,000 feet above seas level. The Red Rocks Trail is easier hiking and also offers horseback riding and mountain biking. You can take the trail in two different directions, one of which takes you in a 6-mile loop. You may know Red Rocks for its concert performance fame. It is well-loved by musicians and concert goers alike. However, there is so much more about Red rocks you can love. The next time you are in the area, head over to Red Rocks and check out all it has to offer that is not music related."
"Coors Brewery","Colorado","Coors Brewery - Golden, CO - a brewing company known for quality","Coors Brewery was established by Jacob Schueler and Adolp Coors who both German immigrants during 1873. It began when Coors found his way to Golden, Colorado and found the water of the Rocky Mountains. Schueler made an eighteen thousand dollar investment and Coors added an additional two thousand dollars to the funding to start the company. Coors became the company's sole owner when he bought his partner out during 1880. Coors Brewery won an award in 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair. In 1916 Colorado received Prohibition three years ahead of the rest of America. The brewery had to drain the contents of five hundred and sixty-one barrels and stopped production of beer. The end of Prohibition found the Coors Brewery still somewhat intact. Adolp Coors Brewing and Manufacturing Company was established by Adolph Coors with his sons Herman and Adolph Jr. a long time prior to the Volstead Act going into effect all over the nation. Ventures such as Herold Porcelain and others were included in the founding of the company. A facility for near beer and malted milk production is what the brewery was converted into during this time. The Coors Brewery sold a great deal of malted milk to make confection with to the Mars candy making company. The beer replacement, Manna, was similar to those sold today. The family relied on the real estate, cement and porcelain company to keep the brewery above water during this time. Coors Brewery was still intact after Prohibition ended and in 1933 it was one of only a few left. In 1936 Coors Brewery added the name of Banquet Beer so commemorate the partying that the miners did at that time. The distribution of Coors was expanded to ten of the Western states during 1939. When World War II came about in 1941 the government gave Coors permission to continue purchasing supplies on the condition that half the beer produced would be reserved for the soldiers fighting the war. Coors made the country's first beer can that was made entirely of aluminum and did away with the steel cans that had a bad effect on the taste during 1959. In 1966 the distribution of Coors Brewery's products was still limited and a number of people traveled to Colorado to purchase the product. President Ford loaded Air Force One with cases of the product during 1975. In 1997 the beer was featured in Smokey and the Bandit. The distribution of products produced by Coors Brewery was expanded across the Mississippi River during 1981. From 1989 until 1992 was when the Coors Brewery's assets that were not related to the brewery spun off. CoorsTex is operated by a descendant of the Harold Porcelain business. Coors Brewery is located at 300 12th Street in Golden, Colorado and during 1990 it became America's third largest brewing facility. During 1991 with Coors becoming available in Indiana it was now in all fifty states. In 1998 Coors Brewery had been in business for one hundred and twenty-five years."
"Coors Field in Denver, Colorado","Colorado","Coors Field in Denver, Colorado","Coors Field is the home of major league baseball team the Colorado Rockies, and is located at 2001 Blake Street, in Denver, Colorado. The stadium is named for the Coors Brewing Company, which purchased the naming rights to the park in 1995, prior to construction being completed. The Colorado Rockies played two seasons in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field in 1995. Groundbreaking for Coors Field began on October 16th, 1992, and the stadium was opened to the public on April 26th, 1995. The park was built at a cost of $300 million dollars, and was designed by the architecture firm of HOK Sport. Coors Field has a natural grass playing surface and a total seating capacity of 50,445 people, 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats as well. Before the first bricks were laid, designers knew the park would be ideal for hitting home runs because of high elevation and dry air. To rectify the situation, the outfield fences were placed farther away from home plate, giving Coors Field one of the largest outfields in baseball history. The field dimensions of the park are as follows; left field 347 feet, left center 390 feet, center field 415 feet, right center 375 feet, right field 350 feet and the backstop 56 feet. Previously, Coors Field had a reputation as being a home-run friendly baseball park, hence the nickname Coors Canaveral. The air in Denver tended to dry out the baseballs and made them harder, causing them to travel farther when hit. Additionally, curve balls will curve less in thinner air than at sea level; which leads to fewer strikeouts and harder work for the pitcher. In 2002, a humidor was added to the park for baseball storage, which has alleviated the problems of the past. Most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green; however seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple, which signifies the city's one mile elevation point. In other baseball stadiums home plate faces east or northeast, while the home plate at Coors Field faces north. Because of the location of home plate, during the game, sunlight shines on first base during sunset. Coors Field was designed with accessibility in mind; it is located near Interstate 25, has direct access to 20th Street and Park Avenue exits, and is near Union Station which provides light rail access for visitors. The stadium was originally designed to be a much smaller venue, however, because of record breaking crowds, right field upper deck and center field bleacher seats were added. The center field bleacher section is known by the informal name of the Rockpile''. Each year, Coors Field hosts some of the most exciting baseball games in the National Baseball League. The landscaped grounds of the stadium are designed to resemble the Colorado Rocky Mountains, complete with waterfalls, fountains and pine trees. Visitors are feted with breathtaking views of the Rocky Mountains, mild temperatures and a lively environment to enjoy a game of baseball."

For residents of the state it is a prime location to head as it is set in the center of the state. The trip is a few hours from Denver for visitors who fly in. Cottonwood Hot Springs is just one location in Buena Vista to visit. The springs are actually 5.5 miles outside of Buena Vista. The springs are at the entrance to Cottonwood Canyon, where there was a hotel and Sanitarium. The lodge on site is one of the oldest buildings, having been built in 1878 by the Reverend and Mrs. J AD Adams. The house/ hotel provided a reception room, office, library, parlor, and private rooms. There were medical attendants on site, along with a bridal chamber, dining hall, and kitchen. The two wings of the structure offered the rooms and sleeping apartments. In the early history of the springs, they were used for medicinal purposes. People would come to drink and soak in the water from the lower springs. The upper springs took a bit to reach and thus the water was piped into the house for bathing. Specifically the upper springs was thought to be good for rheumatism and dyspepsia. At the time the water was thought to be 132 to 150 degrees. Since the original house was built before the railroad all of the materials had to be brought in by freight teams from Colorado Springs. Unfortunately, the original house that was there burnt down in a fire. The springs were almost entirely destroyed. At the time Gabe Durst owned the property and did not want to rebuild. Today the land looks much different than it did in the 19th century. Today visitors can swim for $15 per person and $10 for children 16 and under. Kids must leave the area at dusk.

It was known for its production of silver and gold during its early years and later for the large quantities of zinc and lead that were used during the World Wars. The mine is important in preserving the mining history of Colorado since other mines are quickly disappearing and deteriorating. The Tomlinson brothers and their wives decided to restore the collapsing Country Boy Mine and the mining site during 1991. There was a lot of work put into the mine's restoration, there were eight areas of the mine that had collapsed and needed to be cleared out. There were new timbers installed in the mine, restoration of the blacksmith shop, a barn, office, museum and gift shop were built as well.

The drive is only fifteen minutes from Breckenridge and half an hour from Frisco. When traveling from Vail to the mine it takes an hour, it's an hour and a half from Denver. The mine is no longer active although there are valuable ores still imbedded in the mountain. The facility was no closed because of a lack of gold but as a result of economic conditions associated with the act of mining. There is an estimated value of over twenty-five million dollars given to the veins in the mine but it would take more than that to extract them from the mountain. The Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety in addition to the State of Colorado both inspect the mine to ensure that it is safe for visitors."

"Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado is a Boater's Paradise","Colorado","Curecanti National Recreation Area in Colorado is a Boater's Paradise","	Curecanti National Recreation Area, 200 miles southwest of Denver, Colorado, is a natural area dominated by three reservoirs of the Gunnison River. The reservoirs include Blue Mesa Reservoir, the largest body of water in Colorado and the largest Kokanee Salmon fishery in the U.S.; Morrow Point Reservoir, the beginning of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison; and Crystal Reservoir/East Portal, which is the site of a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark known as the Gunnison Diversion Tunnel. This recreation area was established in 1965 in order to manage the land on and around the Aspinall Storage Unit, a collection of reservoirs created primarily to provide water storage to the Upper Colorado River Basin states of Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and Utah. Today, besides being ecologically important, it's a prime recreation area, especially for those who enjoy boating, fishing, and other water sports. For visitors, a good first stop is at the Elk Creek Visitors Center, which provides guests with lists of things to do, current special events, maps, and more. Here, guests can make reservations for boat tours and kids can sign up for junior ranger programs. Fishing is tops here, and the largest Lake Trout ever caught in Colorado was pulled from the Blue Mesa Reservoir in May 2007, weighing in at more than 50 pounds and 44 inches long. Kokonee season runs from September to December, depending on what part of the park one visits. Furthermore, portions of the Gunnison River that run through Curecanti National Recreation Area are designated Gold Medal & Wild Trout Waters, a designation given to the rivers that have the best potential for trophy trout fishing. Fly fishing is the small creeks that feed the reservoirs is popular and often these creeks are prime snagging areas. Blue Mesa Reservoir, at 20 miles long, is a prime location for boating. Many of the arms of the reservoir reach into secluded canyons and make for very picturesque voyages. In addition, windsurfing is popular on this reservoir as is waterskiing. The smaller Morrow Point Reservoir is ideal for sea kayaking and canoeing. The scenery is breathtaking and backcountry campsites make it possible to enjoy a multi-day trip on this twelve-mile-long reservoir. Guests can also book a 1.5 hour pontoon boat tour of Morrow Point, available twice each day (weather permitting) and narrated by a National Park ranger. Crystal Reservoir is limited to hand-carried vessels and can be quite tricky for inexperienced kayakers or canoers. In addition, this recreation area offers about a half-dozen hiking trails ranging from easy 1.5 mile round trip trails to a very strenuous 6 mile round trip hike with an 1,800 foot elevation change. Horseback riding trails are also available. Hunting is also permitted within the park during certain times of the year and under strict Colorado guidelines. Camping is available at numerous campsites located throughout the Curecanti National Recreation Area. A total of about 400 sites are located here and some are open year round while others are limited to the late spring and summer. Facilities vary but those that are open from fall to spring offer limited facilities during that time. Reservations are essential during the summer."
"Dangerous Reptile Fun","Colorado","Dangerous Reptile Fun","Kids and adults who love a truly dangerous adventure will love a visit to the Colorado Alligator Farm. The farm's story began back in 1974 when the Young family moved from Texas to Colorado with their children. They intended to grow Tilapia fish in the warm geothermal waters on their 80-acre farm. This farm is now home to the reptile park that started when they purchased 100 year old alligators in 1987. They intended to use these gators to dispose of their dead fish, but when the gators grew quickly in the geothermal waters the locals started asking to see them. In 1990 they opened to the public and became a popular media attraction. Throughout the years, families have brought reptiles to the park after deciding they no longer wanted them. The farm features an alligator wrestling class. A bit of a misnomer, students do not actually wrestle the gators, but they do learn how to handle them properly. The class starts in mid-March and features lessons with a 9-foot alligator. You start with smaller gators and work your way up. This is a three hour class and the cost is $100. There are classes on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. There are also classes available for smaller reptile handling if you are not up for a 9-foot gator. The farm features an outreach program that spreads the message of the biology, behavior and ecological roles reptiles play. Included in the traveling show are turtles, gators, lizards, and snakes. The program is hands on, so if you know a group that loves to see dangerous, intriguing animals up close, give the arm a call. These programs are popular with school children. It is a one hour program that can be expanded. Prices start at $200 plus mileage. Featured in the program are Doug the 50-lb tortoise, and Dream, the Albino Python. Remembering it roots, the farm still features fish ponds that feature Rocky Mountain White Tilapia. These fish have been hybridized over the course of more than 30 years and they grow to 1 1/2 pounds in under 6 months. These fish are distributed to area restaurants and are favorites of diners in Colorado and across the country. The land the farm is situated on is home to tons of plants and the Youngs quickly decided to plant all over-everything from radishes to cattails. It creates a unique and fascinating home for the reptiles delivered to the farm from owners who did not anticipate how large they would grow. In other cases, these residents have been abused and the farm is their last hope. The farm features a gift shop that sells a variety of items including novelties, educational items, clothing, and toys. Your trip to the gator farm will not soon be forgotten but head home with a souvenir to share with others. Colorado Gator Farm encourages visitors to spread the word about their mission, the attraction, and the importance of the work they do. Whether you are searching for an exciting adventure or you would like to see alligators and other reptiles in a healthy environment, head to this farm."

"Denver Zoological Gardens in Denver, Colorado","Colorado","Denver Zoological Gardens in Denver, Colorado","The Denver Zoological Gardens was founded in 1896, when an orphaned American black bear cub was given to the mayor. The mayor gave the rambunctious cub to keeper of the City Park, Alexander J. Graham who began the zoo with the cub. Other animals at the zoo included native waterfowl at Duck Lake, antelope, prairie dogs and a flock of Chinese pheasants. A population of red squirrels was added to the zoo in 1905, and completely destroyed the bird population.  The squirrels were then trapped and released into the Denver Mountain Park. In 1906, Denver mayor Robert W. Spears decided to do away with the bars on the habitats and replace them with concrete rocks, waterfalls and trees. City landscape architect Saco DeBoer was hired to draw up plans for the renovation, and Victor H. Borcherdt was brought on to act as director of the zoo. Borcherdt was instrumental in the construction of the Bear Mountain exhibit, which he designed between the years of 1917-1918. The Bear Mountain exhibit stands 43 feet tall and 185 feet long and the cost of construction was approximately $50,000. The structure was constructed using dyed and textured concrete forms which were cast from Dinosaur Mountain in Morrison, Colorado. To enhance the natural appeal of the habitat, hidden moats replaced bars; native plants and a stream were also added. The Bear Mountain exhibit established the Denver Zoo as a leader among American Zoos. Using funds from the Works Project Administration, the zoo made one notable addition, Monkey Island which was constructed in 1937. During the following years, very little was done to modernize the zoo and it was in poor condition. However, with the election of Mayor Quigg Newton, Saco DeBoer was rehired to devise plans for the rebirth of the zoo. During the 1950's, the zoo overhauled Monkey Island, expanded and improved the grounds and exhibits and today is a world-class facility. The zoo has continued to grow and in recent years has added some very significant new exhibits. In 2005, Predator Ridge exhibit was constructed. The display is representative of the African Savannah and has the ability to rotate between different predators such as lions, hyenas and African wild dogs. Complete with overlapping scents, the exhibit provides environmental enrichment for the various animals. Opening in 2009, the Asian Tropics exhibit is the largest and most expensive addition yet. Constructed at a cost of $40 million, the exhibit houses Asian elephants and other larger animals, in an outdoor rotational habitat. The exhibit will also include Indian Rhinoceros, Malayan Tapirs, Black leopards, Muntjacs, Asian elephant cows and many other types of animals. The Denver Zoo is open 365 days a year and summer hours are from March 1st through November 1st, from 9 am until 5 pm, and winter hours are from November 2nd through February 28th, from 10 am until 4 pm. Parking at the facility is free of charge, the zoo is fully handicapped accessible and provides picnic and concessions areas located conveniently throughout the park."
"Denver's Red Rocks Amphitheatre Offers Acoustic Perfection in a Natural Setting","Colorado","Denver's Red Rocks Amphitheatre Offers Acoustic Perfection in a Natural Setting","Located just west of Denver in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Red Rocks Amphitheatre has been recognized for more than a century as a premiere performance venue. This geologically-formed natural amphitheatre is blessed with top-notch acoustics, providing an ideal site for concerts of any variety. Red Rocks Amphitheatre is one-of-a-kind and its excellent acoustics are a result of the two giant monoliths that surround the seating area. Dubbed the Ship Rock and the Creation Rock, the sandstone structures are taller than Niagara Falls, They first caught the eye of John Brisben Walker during the early years of the 20th century. Walker recognized the Red Rocks area, once called the Garden of Angels, as an acoustically perfect setting that would enhance any concert that took place there. He constructed a temporary platform and from 1906-1910 was responsible for the organization of many performances at the site. Walker's amphitheatre was purchased by the city of Denver in 1927 and was eventually enhanced and enlarged with the help of two Depression-era labor groups, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Work Projects Administration (WPA). The stage and seating area were designed by local architect Burnham Hoyt. He completed his plans in 1936 and five years later the amphitheatre held its dedicatory ceremony and performance. Word of the Red Rocks Amphitheatre's fine acoustics spread and the venue began attracting performers from around the world and audiences from throughout the region and beyond. In 1947, the amphitheatre began hosting an Easter Sunrise Service and continues to do so today. Also that year, the first official concert season'' was organized, offering performances throughout the late spring, summer, and early fall. Today, concert season at Red Rocks Amphitheatre still runs from May until September. The theater seats 9,450 people and all seats offer an excellent view of the stage. However, the Red Rocks area is more than just an amphitheatre. Locals and guests also visit Red Rocks to experience the natural beauty of the site. The 1.4-mile Trading Post Loop Trail takes hikers on a rugged trek through valleys, meadows, and past a variety of magnificent rock formations at about 6,300 feet above sea level. Several species of native trees and plants can be viewed along the trail and in the Red Rocks vicinity in general, as well as a variety of species of animals and birds. A Visitor Center provides trail maps and other pertinent information related to exploring the area around Red Rocks Amphitheatre."

"Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and Colorado Provides a Look at the Jurassic Period","Colorado","Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and Colorado Provides a Look at the Jurassic Period","	Located on the southeast edge of the Uinta Mountains on the border between Utah and Colorado, Dinosaur National Monument sits at the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers. Declared a National Monument in 1915, the area began as an 80 acre tract of land surrounding a quarry full of dinosaur bones but later expanded to include about 200,000 acres in both states, including the canyons of the Green and Yampa Rivers. The fossils that make up the centerpiece of this national monument were discovered in 1909 by paleontologist Earl Douglass, who worked for Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum. Douglass and his crew sent thousands of specimens back to the museum for study; however, many remain at the Dinosaur National Monument to be enjoyed by the nearly half-a-million visitors that stop there each year to view what is considered the largest quarry of Jurassic Period dinosaur bones ever discovered. Scientists have discovered many complete skeletons at this quarry and many of the bones have gone to other natural history museums throughout the United States. A Visitor Center was built over the quarry so that guests could view the bones while still protecting their fragility. Unfortunately, the visitor area closed in 2006 due to structural problems, so visitors will be presented with a multi-media program until the building is replaced. Nonetheless, there are other activities to enjoy at Dinosaur National Monument as well. Nearly as fascinating as the dinosaur bones are the ancient petroglyphs found at this park. This Native American art work can be explored by visitors though problems with vandals have limited exposure to the petroglyphs. Hiking is a favorite activity of those who visit Dinosaur National Monument. Trails include long and short hiking opportunities. Many begin at the Visitor Center and several of the shorter trails connect with one another to offer longer options. Some travel along the rivers. Many of the trails are both paved and accessible to handicapped visitors. River rafting on the Green and Yampa Rivers is also a popular pursuit within this national monument area. While the Green River is a little more challenging, both offer Class III and IV rapids that can trip up even the experienced paddler. A number of commercial guides offer trips down these rivers, including both one-day and multi-day adventures. Both rivers also welcome anglers, who may expect to catch a variety of species. Horses, mules, burros, and llamas are permitted within the boundaries of the park for those who wish to ride. Overnight trips with stock animals require a permit.

"Dinosaur Ridge","Colorado","Dinosaur Ridge, Morrison, CO","Dinosaur Ridge is a non profit organization which allows visitors to learn about Colorado and its heritage. Dinosaur Ridge is located in Morrison, Colorado. Morrison is located in the center of the state, just a bit north of dead center. Historically the town has a long history with dinosaurs. In 1877 the first remains were found of a Stegosaurus Armatus and Apatosaurus Ajaz. Both were found near Arthur Lakes. In the 19th century Bone Wars'' occurred as rival paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh tried to discover and keep the bones they uncovered. Eventually the late Jurassic area of Morrison was excavated near the lakes to see what could be found in honor of the town. Many of the fossils are found at the Morrison Natural History Museum in Morrison Houses and some are on display at the lakes. However, Dinosaur Ridge is also a place to see the numerous fossils the earth has revealed. Dinosaur Ridge is a visitor center with two interpretive trails leading around the lake area. In 2008 the center received an upgrade with Trek Through Time, which is an indoor exhibit area for Dinosaur Ridge. The ridge has served to be a place for science teachers and explorers. The teachers created outdoor geology laboratories to teach their students. The National Park Service had a hand in creating the park when they designated the area as the Morrison Fossil Area National Park in 1973. The park service felt the area was highly significant to history and science. In 2001 the state offered it as a State Natural Area for paleontological and ecological studies. In 2006 a Colorado Geological Survey designated Dinosaur Ridge and Triceratops Trail as points of Geological Interest. Along Dinosaur Ridge many famous fossil discoveries were made. Some of those were mentioned above. Most of the species found along the ridge date to 150 million years ago in the period called the Age of Giants.'' The ridge is part of the Rocky Mountain Region, in which a Dinosaur Gold'' Rush occurred in the late 1800's. One interesting discovery was the Iguanodon plant eating dinosaur and the ostrich sized meat eating dinosaurs. It took until 2004 for the Dinosaur Ridge Triceratops Trail to be opened, allowing for more areas of discovery. Those walking along the trails will have an information pamphlet to tell them about the trail, fossils, tracks, and more. The beginning of the trails and visitor center is located on Alameda Parkway. A gift shop on the premises is open Monday through Saturday 9am to 5pm, and Sunday 11am to 5pm. A shuttle bus will bring visitors to the park on Monday through Saturday from 10am to 4pm, and Sunday 11am to 4pm.

"Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad In Durango, Colorado","Colorado","Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad In Durango, Colorado","William Jackson Palmer was a general during the American Civil War and a railroad designer. He had a dream of making a railroad that would connect Mexico to Colorado. He worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad working through the ranks to be Secretary to the President. However, this was not enough for Palmer, he followed his dream and built the Denver-Rio Grande Railroad in 1870, with the help of his friend Dr. William Bell. Together, they envisioned a railway system with narrow-gauge lines, which would be better suited to the mountains in Colorado. On August 5th, 1881, the D&RG Railroad arrived in Colorado, with construction to Silverton, Colorado following in the fall of that year. Within only eleven months, the railway reached Silverton, Colorado in July of 1882. With it, began the immediate transport of passengers and freight. The tracks were built between 1881 and 1882, with additional trackage laid down in 1887,because of the need to transport the silver and gold ore that were being mined in the San Juan Mountains. The Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad is a series of tracks over 45 miles long on a track of 36 inches wide.  A line from Chama, New Mexico to Durango, Colorado has been removed. However, the line from Durango to Silverton has ran non-stop since 1881, and is now a popular tourist attraction. The location is one of the few areas in the United States which has continued to use steam locomotives. In 1981, the D&RG (Durango-Rio Grande Railroad) Western, sold the line and in turn D&SNG (Denver-Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad), was formed. With some of the track dating back to 1881, the trains continue to operate during the winter months from Durango to the Cascade Wye, and during the summer from Durango to Silverton. There are also two museums on the property, the Silverton Freight Museum and the Durango Museum. They are home to historic locomotives and railway equipment used during this period.  The entrance to the museum goes through station, where there is a gift shop and ticket booth. There are also layouts and train displays. The museum occupies half of the round house while the other half is devoted the operating locomotives. The railway was designated a National Landmark in 1961. The railway is also designated as a Historical Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers."

Elitch as it is today first came into being when it was acquired by CNL in April of 2007. At that time all Looney Tunes themes (typically associated with Six Flags) were removed and several new rides and attractions were gradually introduced to freshen up the park. These include the RipQurl water slide in 2007 and an interactive haunted house ride known as Ghost Blasters that was added in 2008. At this time, Elitch also began hosting a new summertime concert series that features big name recording artists such as Billy Ray Cyrus, Randy Travis, Smash Mouth, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

The most intense category - the thrill rides - features such attractions as the Tower of Doom drop ride, the Rainbow swing ride, the Mind Eraser monster coaster, and the Hollywood & Vine spin ride. Family rides include classics like the carousel, the Big Wheel giant ferris wheel, and the Tea Cups. The kiddie section largely consists of milder versions of other rides to be found elsewhere in the park. In addition to all of these, Elitch also includes water rides such as Disaster Canyon, a white water rafting adventure; and Shipwreck Falls, an exciting adventure ride that treats riders to a breath-taking plunge over a 50-foot waterfall into the tidal wave below. Elitch Gardens also features many different types of sit-down entertainment options appropriate for park goers of all ages.

The Anasazi people abandoned the dwellings they called home for hundreds of years somewhat mysteriously. Most scientists believe they were starved or forced out, and that drought more than likely played a major role. Others believe there may have been an enemy attack driving them away from their homes. There is little evidence lefts explaining why the cliffs were abandoned, aside from the pictographsthat can still be seen on the cliff's walls today. Located next to the cliff is a Pueblo-style building that is home to a museum and giftshop. The museum features diorama showing daily Anasazi life, pottery, weapons, tools, and videos that teach about the history of these fascinating people. The museum opened in 1906 and has grown over the years to make the experience more educational. While in the Pueblo, stop by the gift shop filled with videos, books, and handicrafts like pottery, jewelry, rugs, and blankets representing the Native American culture. Also on the grounds is a reproduction of a stone mesa-top building, as well as an Anasazi baking oven. The nature walk takes you around the grounds so you are able to explore the flowers, trees, herbs, and other plants that helped the Anasazi sustain life in the area for so many years. If you get hungry, stop by the snack bar that is open during summer months and enjoy dining in the picnice area nearby. The Manitou Cliff Dwellings sit is a great destination for field trips and school groups. Children love exploring the cave dwellings and it is a great hands on opportunity for kids to learn about Native American history. Bringing the history to life with the exploration of the caves and the story of the Anasazi makes the lessons more interesting for children. The site supplies a study guide so the learning and discussion can continue when you arrive back in the classroom. The Cliff Dwellings is also a great place to host an event. The natural site makes every event unique and the site can be reserved for parties, reunions, weddings, and other special events. The Manitou Cliff Dwellings in Manitou Spring, Colorado is a fascinating and mysterious place to visit.

"Hiking Destination in Colorado","Colorado","Hiking Destination in Colorado","Hanging Lake is situated in Glenwood Canyon east of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

The Hanging Lake Trail starts at the rest stop off of Exit 125 on I-70 Eastbound. This is an eastbound exit only so travelers approaching from the Denver side have to use MP 121 and double back. The climb to Hanging Lake is a little over one mile and is considered to be a very demanding hike. Parts of the trail are extremely steep and travelers undertaking the trek to the lake must be constantly alert. There aren't many flat sections within the trail system and hikers are required to negotiate some rock-strewn areas. Hikers are strongly advised to bring an adequate water supply, particularly during the warmer summer months. The Lake is located on a steep shelf within Glenwood Canyon. The effort to reach the lake, although a strenuous undertaking will be rewarded by the scenic beauty surrounding the lake area. It can't be emphasized enough, that the short climb will test the energy level of even the more experienced rock climber. Hikers are encouraged to take their time ascending the mountainside and enjoy the breathtaking landscape. Care must be taken at the top due to the steep drop-offs surrounding the lake. Trail preservation has become increasingly more demanding due to the more than 80,000 climbers each year using the path. Visitors often disregard the rules posted at the trailhead. Pets are not allowed on the trail, but this rule is often ignored. Hikers are asked to leave the trail in the same manner as they find it, but trash is still a significant problem for the volunteers to deal with. Boy Scouts, the local Kiwanis Club and other conservation minded groups help with maintenance, but even with that the upkeep is difficult. The Forest Service holds educational seminars for the young at local schools to help educate the public on the need to observe the trail regulations at Hanging Lake. A boardwalk on the southern shore of Hanging Lake allows visitors to take in the splendor of the lake setting without disturbing the delicate build up of carbonate deposits. On the opposite shore from the boardwalk is Bridal Veil Falls, a small but stunning waterfall. Schools of wild trout cruise the clear mountain lake water. The trout are protected as both fishing and swimming, including wading, is not allowed due to the delicate environment. To the west of the lake visitors will find Spouting Rock, a cascade of water that has over the years worn its way through the limestone. Although the water is crystal clear it must be purified before it can be consumed. Tourists are advised to get to the lake fairly early to avoid crowds, especially during the warm weather months. A less busy trek can be enjoyed during the off season. The popularity of Hanging Lake continues to grow as word of its beauty spreads.

"Historic Casino in Cripple Creek","Colorado","Historic Casino in Cripple Creek","Originally built as a drugstore, the Palace Hotel was transformed to a hotel in 1892, due to the number of miners traveling into the area.

There were times when the hotel owners rented chairs in which miners would sleep and charge them $1 for a night's stay.''

The new hotel was so palatial and impressive, it attracted rich gold barons and people who could afford to place large bets in the casino. Around the beginning of the 1900's, a man named Dr. Chambers and his wife Kitty purchased the hotel, and Miss Kitty ran the hotel better than anyone had before. She was known as a spectacular host, lighting candles throughout the hotel and turning down the beds of guests before they retired for the evening. She took pride in her work, so much so she may not have left the grounds following her death in 1908. She died in room #3 in the hotel, and many believe her spirit continues to haunt the room. Guests sometimes find lit candles and beds turned down, and others have actually seen the ghost of Miss Kitty, describing the woman in her white nightgown walking through the rooms and fussing about in room #3. Others have reported the presence of ghosts throughout the hotel such as a piano player, another woman, and a short fat man.

"Howelsen Ski Area","Colorado","Howelsen Ski Area - Steamboat Springs, CO - a paradise with diverse history and a skiing paradise","The Howelsen Ski Area has been in operation since 1914 and can be found across from Steamboat Springs on the Yampa River. The city owns and operates the facility which is one of the oldest ski areas in the country that has seen continuous use and the only one on the historic places register for Colorado. The ski area has had almost seventy Winter Olympians train on the jumps and slopes that it offers. It was Elk Park which was a small preserve for wildlife before it began being used as a ski hill. Skiing was thought of as just a way to travel around the area during winter before Carl Howelsen a Norwegian skier arrived during 1913. He brought more aspects of skiing to the area. Howelsen began organizing the Winter Sports Club in Steamboat Springs' training program during 1914. He also organized the original Winter Carnival featuring an exhibition of ski jumping located on Woodchuck Hill. The hill is now the home to Colorado Mountain College. He began looking at a hill near Elk Park because he believed that he need a steeper slope to break the records already set for ski jumping. The jump was built after the area was cleared. In 1917 the slope was given the name of Howelsen Hill and a herd of elk was relocated some years later. The vertical rise of Howelsen Hill was only four hundred and forty feet, it continued to be a jumping hill until the 1920's when interest changed to the slalom, downhill and Alpine disciplines. The hill's east flank was cleared to make room for a slalom course during 1931. In 1934 a cable was used to pull a sled hauling timber and other materials to maintain and fix the jumps when the boat tow was built as the first lift on the hill at Howelsen Ski Area. During 1937 the lift was moved, made larger and reconstructed to be more suitable to the mountain at the time. The areas Winter Carnival Night Show was held for the first time during 1935 with ski jumping though a hoop, fireworks and torchlight parades. The night skiing at the facility was offered as far back as 1937 and is still a feature of the Howelsen Ski Area. The ski area received a beginners' rope tow during 1945 on the Sulphur Cave Hill to the west of the jumps. The base of the lodge was began and completed during 1946. Through the years the Howelsen Ski Area saw a number of new additions and in 1991 the lodge at the area was expanded to include training facilities, a meeting room and office. Through the years the facilities at the Howelsen Ski Area have been continually updated to keep them up to code and ensure the safety of visitors.

There are over sixty-five acres of wilderness at the top of Lookout Mountain which is got its name because the Ute Indian tribe used it as a vantage point to lookout.'' Not only is the mountain the site of Buffalo Bill's burial it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A mountain park was proposed as a getaway spot by a group of local residents and businessman during 1889. Lookout Mountain was chosen over Eden Park after some debate. Frederick Law Olmsted who designed New York City's Central Park was the architect chosen to design the park as a naturalist resort. The syndicate acquired the original site of Lookout Mountain Park but there was not much construction because of the 1893 Silver Crash. The Silver Crash combined with the death of the aging stockholders delayed progress although the park site was eventually purchased by Ress Vidler. Vidler was the businessman that constructed the funicular incline railway leading to the top of the mountain and the other attractions. The park system of the Denver Mountains started to consider the original site of Lookout Mountain Park and with the assistance of Mayor Robert W. Speeder it was eventually acquired. In 1917 the area became the new Lookout Mountain Park. The original park was beside the new one for a short time until it went bankrupt leaving the new park to be Lookout Mountain Park. A summer home for his family was built by Charles Boettcher during 1917. One hundred and ten acres was donated to Jefferson County by Charliene Breeden (his granddaughter) during 1968. A room in the Boettcher Mansion and then the garage of the mansion were used to house the Lookout Mountain Nature Center. The servant's house was used starting in 1990 and the LMNC was opened during 1997. The design uses recycled materials such as soda bottles, sawdust and the boxcars of trains to build the facility. The Lookout Mountain Park offices are open Monday through Friday from 7:30am until 5:30pm. There are a number of services offered at the Nature Center of Lookout Mountain Park that include groups, individuals and even toddlers.

"Molly Brown House Museum","Colorado","Molly Brown House Museum, Denver, CO - Museum","Molly Brown was well known for being one of the survivors of the Titanic disaster. Her story is well known, and her house has been well preserved so that people everywhere can see how she lived. The Molly Brown House Museum in Denver, CO, enables visitors to see the beauty of this elegant home. Although she grew up in a very modest home, her husband later became very rich after discovering silver in a mine. As was typical of the wealthier people in Denver, they had a new home built in Capitol Hill in 1889. They hired architect William Lang to provide them with designs and build their new home. It was to be elegant, and it was to have everything in it that was considered modern at the time - including electricity, running water, and steam heat. Molly Brown had gained her reputation from a song written about her. Although they were already well known, she had booked passage on the Titanic to travel and see Egypt, Rome, and Paris. She traveled with her daughter and her friends J.J. and Madeleine Astor. When the Titanic hit the iceberg, Molly was thrown out of her bed onto the floor. She then discovered what had happened, helped some people, and was quickly put on the first lifeboat. Although it could hold 65 people, the lifeboat was sent away with only 24 on board. After about four hours at sea, they were picked up by the Carpathia. Arriving back in New York, a crowd of 30,000 people awaited the news. When asked what she credited her survival to, she simply said Typical Brown luck. We're unsinkable. The Browns lived in this home for many years. She died after her husband in 1932. The house has been restored with period furniture and the elegance that it had when the unsinkable Molly Brown was alive. The Museum also has a Victorian Dinner Experience. These are public events and include their elegant settings, as well as a tour. Some of the events include Teas (Cream Tea, Full Tea, and a High Tea), a Luncheon that includes sherry and smokehouse almonds, a main entree, a salad, rice or potato, rolls, and a dessert. The Titanic Dinner is their most elegant and it comes complete with a candlelight tour of the mansion. The dinner is certainly reminiscent of the grand elegance of the Titanic and it includes an eight-course menu. There are also luncheons and teas for children's groups. Events can be planned at the Molly Brown House, which could provide the perfect motif for your event. The event rooms are on the third floor, however, and they are not accessible. Visitors can see the Molly Brown House by taking a tour through it. All tours are guided and take about 45 minutes.

"Mount Evans","Colorado","Mount Evans, Denver, CO - Scenic","Mount Evans in Denver, CO has to be probably one of the most scenic roads in the United States. Being that it is the highest paved road in North America, the view from the top is absolutely incredible. Seeing Colorado from this height would be a great trip for the whole family. The road to the top of Mt. Evans has held the honor of being the highest road for a long time. Around the turn of the century, the cities of the area - Colorado Springs and Denver - were competing to bring out tourists from the east. When Colorado Springs completed the road to the top of Pike's Peak, it did succeed in gaining tourists - and taking them away from the Denver area. Soon, though, Denver had its own idea. It was in 1917 that the dirt road to the top of Mt. Evans was started. Taking 10 years to complete, it was finally finished in 1927. Then, it was paved during the 1930's. Later a restaurant and souvenir shop was opened at the top, but this burned down in 1979 and it was never rebuilt. The foundation and a rock wall, however, are still in place. They make a great place to stand on and observe the surrounding valleys and nearby mountains. Mount Evans is a total of 14, 264 feet high from sea level. The road, which is completely paved, is fourteen miles to the top. From there, you can take just a short walk of about two blocks to the peak. On the road to the top you will see the beautiful Summit Lake. This gorgeous lake has a number of trails around it. There is also a rest area by it. In some areas, you can listen to rangers talk about certain features and give some history - including information about the 1,700-year-old bristle cone trees that are there. Echo Lake is another place to stop and enjoy the view. Fishing is permitted, too. While on the road to the top, there certainly are many places to stop and take some excellent pictures. You may also see some of the various forms of wildlife on the mountain, which includes white mountain goats and Bighorn sheep, deer, elk, picas, marmots, and squirrels. As you go up and when you reach the top, you will notice nearly breath-taking scenery all around. On clear days, you can see mountain peaks and valleys many miles away. You may even see a thunderstorm below in one of the valleys. Of course, you certainly do not want to forget your camera. Another structure on top of the mountain is the Meyer-Womble Observatory, which has been there since 1996. Up until the year 2,000, this observatory had been the highest one in the world. The Denver University runs it. There are a number of places to see while you are on Mount Evans. In order to see, them, though, you will need to make plans to do so. You can learn more at their Website. There are picnic areas, a number of campsites, and some of them are accessible (Mount Goliath Natural Area). Mount Evans near Denver, CO is very seasonal. The road is accessible only from the end of May until the end of September. You should also be aware that there is a great temperature difference between Denver and the top of the mountain. While it may be 80 degrees in the city, it may only be 40 degrees on top - be prepared and dress accordingly."

The primary focus of the museum is dedicated to the Pueblo Army Air Base and the magnificent B-24 Liberator bomber. The Wiesbrod Museum can be found on the grounds of what was once the Pueblo Army Air Base during World War II at the Pueblo Memorial Airport. Managed by the Pueblo Historical Aircraft Society, the museum operates approximately six miles east of Pueblo, Colorado just off of US Highway 50. Most of the planes on exhibit are on loan from the different branches of the military. The one exception is the McDonnell Douglas F-101 Voodoo which is owned and displayed by a private vendor. The museum depends heavily upon volunteers to lend a hand with the overall operation of the facility. Men and women aircraft enthusiasts regularly volunteer their time supporting the museum activities including admissions, tours, aircraft restorations, and working in the museum's gift shop. Recurring events feature open cockpit tours of select aircraft. Visitors can access the museum's library where a tape collection guides them through the various aircraft and history of the Pueblo Army Base during World War II. The aircraft on display are full-size, mostly complete, entire planes located inside the hangar area and outside on the museum grounds. The museum staff has taken great care in presenting the aircraft as close to the originally equipped condition as possible. The highlight of the visit for some lucky tourists is to receive a personal tour from a veteran pilot of World War II. Many of the museum staff are veterans who are more than pleased to pass on their exciting stories and relate to visitors what it was like to fly in one of the historic aircraft. Many guests are surprised that this small, out of the way museum, packs so much information and array of working displays.

"Old Fall River Road","Colorado","Old Fall River Road - Rocky Mountain National Park, CO - a steep difficult to travel road that has since been replaced","The first road in northern Colorado to cross the Rocky Mountains was the Fall River Road.

There was no a lot of progress made by the inmates and during 1920 the road was completed by contractors.

The pass is at an elevation of over eleven thousand feet and the road leave it going down the mountain's west side until it reaches the Grand Lake. The original Old Fall River Road's surface was a difficult to maintain and travel even though it was a popular route.

The Buena Vista location has been in business since 1972. They offer fully guided trips every day. Anyone can go white water rafting, though younger children or those with medical conditions are urged to consider the trek before signing up. White water rafting is done on the Arkansas River, which can have areas of extreme rapids. For this reason children must be at least 4 years of age and weigh 35 pounds. Children of 4 must go on the Family Float Trip. Children who are 6 years and 50 pounds can go on the Browns or Bighorn Sheep Canyon trip. These two trips are Class III rapids. All guides have been trained and certified to be white water rafting with people. For those who do not have a great deal of experience rafting the lesser trips should be taken. The trips all include self bailing white water rafts, fully guided tours, neoprene wetsuits, booties and splash tops. These suits are for rent in addition to the trip costs. A photo is taken of every trip and available for purchase in the gift shop. A free whitewater rafting slide show is also given. The gift shop offers souvenirs, cold drinks, and snacks. The Family Float Trip is on 1 and 2 class rapids. The bus takes visitors to the calmest part in the river where one can look out at the mountains. Many of the peaks are 14,000 feet. The raft will go under the railroad trestle, and all visitors should be on the lookout for elk, hawks, eagles, and deer along the river. It is possible to get a little wet on the trip. Brown Canyon is the most popular trek down the river. The white water class can be III in some areas. One can take a half or full day trip depending on preference and budget. The full day trip allows one to raft right from the resort's private beach down the river. No shuttle is necessary in the beginning. The trip lasts for six hours with a stop to learn about the history, geology, and wildlife in the area. Depending on the trip prices can range from $28 and up. The $28 per person tour is the Family Trip for 2 hours. The Brown Canyon option is $53 for adults and $43 for children for a half day. The half day trip lasts three hours.

"Road Through Rugged Terrain","Colorado","Road Through Rugged Terrain","Shelf Road derived its name from the lower section of the road which was blasted out of the steep Four Mile Canyon walls. 4-wheel drive vehicles are a must on the rugged, mountainous drive. The journey along Shelf Road is for the adventurous and not for the faint of heart.  The climate and weather conditions in this Southern Colorado area are known to be somewhat volatile. Shelf Road parallels Cripple Creek, a popular rock-climbing area and home of the Garden Park Fossil Area. The road was formerly used as a stage route between Canon City and Cripple Creek. Shelf Road is part of the Gold Belt Tour that traces historic routes used long ago in this Southern Colorado region. Other similar routes in the area are Phantom Canyon Road, High Park Road, and Teller One. The Gold Belt Tour offers a vast array of scenery including canyons and gently sloping hillsides. Visitors to this rugged but beautiful area are advised to follow some basic guidelines in order to be safe during their exploration of the Shelf Road area. Motor homes, trailers of any type, and campers should avoid the Shelf Road area, particularly the upper section due to the winding, narrow path. Make certain that you have sufficient fuel and water to make it from one town to the next. Weather is always a factor to be taken seriously since conditions change rapidly. Be aware of flash flood warnings during periods of heavy rain. When exploring the hillsides be cautious of loose footing and never climb alone. There are old abandoned mines throughout the area which can represent real danger to the unaware climber. Motorists are encouraged to pull fully off of the road to take pictures or go on foot to see the sights. The Shelf Road route between Canon City and Cripple Creek will take travelers approximately 2 hours, but weather and the amount of traffic may impact the overall travel time. Obviously, if stops are made along the way to take pictures or just to enjoy the beautiful scenery, the trip can take up to a few hours or even a few days longer. When driving the Shelf Road motorists should be on the alert for vehicles traveling in the opposite direction. Visibility is often limited so caution is advised. On blind corners drivers are encouraged to sound the horn to signal oncoming traffic. This drive is a lot of fun and can be safe if you drive slowly and use common sense. In addition to hiking and rock climbing, mountain biking is popular in the area due to the substantial assortment of dirt trails. Horseback riding are also available on the Trails of Gold near Victor and Cripple Creek. Shelf Road winds through public as well as private property. Visitors are asked to please respect private property by not trespassing. Maps of the area can be obtained in Canon City from the Bureau of Land Management.

Fund raising for the museum's site began during 1981 and in 1990 the facility opened at its current location. She donated one hundred quilts out of her private collection to the RMQM which was originally the National Quilt Museum. Eugenia spent the first year greeting the visitors of the museum since here quilts were the exhibits. The Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum offers the benefit of educators either at the museum or that come to you to show techniques, styles and patterns of various quilts. The history of quilting is gone over briefly and educational talks can be tailored to specific interests and needs. There are trunk shows which can be designed for group needs presented to children from preschool to elementary school, civic and fraternal organizations and quilting groups. They can also be given to those in assisted living facilities or retirement homes. The trunk shows provided by the Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum use quilts to show the various aspects of the quilt. There is a minimum of thirty minutes and a maximum of sixty minutes required for trunk shows in addition to the time required to set them up. The only thing the organization hosting the show has to provide is a table; those putting on the show will provide racks. The audience can have as many as one hundred and fifty people.

"Royal Gorge Bridge and Park in Canon City, CO","Colorado","Royal Gorge Bridge and Park in Canon City, CO","Anyone who is visiting in Canon City, Colorado or headed towards Colorado Springs should consider the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. It is a one of a kind location for visitors to experience a natural wonder in North America. The park is more than 360 acres with 21 rides, shows, and attractions to explore. The park is above the actual gorge where the railroad will run through along the river. When at the park visitors can see the views from the Suspension Bridge. This structure is 1.053 feet above the canyon and spans a quarter mile. It is a driving bridge, with a walkway on either side, so it is still possible to enjoy the view as one moves over it. To really gain an idea of what it is like there is the Aerial Tram. This will take visitors over the gorge in an enclosed car going from one side to the other of the gorge. The Royal Rush Skycoaster is also there for a thrill. Children are able to enjoy their own brand of fun with the antique carousel, Silver Rock Railway, petting zoo, Wapiti Western Wildlife Park, and petting zoo. The wildlife park offers American Bison, Rocky Mountain Elk, and Big Horn Sheep. Also on the site for the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park are the Plaza Theatre, gift shops, and restaurants. The theatre supplies a historical display of the area. It also shows one the trails, hiking, camping, and biking areas one can enjoy. Royal Gorge was discovered by the Native Americans who used to hunt and camp in the canyons and mountains. The Utes were the most important tribe to Canyon City. However, the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Blackfeet and Comanche were also known to move through the area in order to follow the buffalo. In 1642 the Spanish came to the gorge as missionaries. Fur traders and trappers also came in the 1700's. Eventually in 1806 Lt. Zebulon Montgomery Pike made his way to the Gorge with a scouting party. Pike is better known for the peak named after him. The Royal Gorge saw war in 1877 when silver was found in the Arkansas River. There was a huge controversy, especially between the two railroads: Rio Grande and Santa Fe. The history of the gorge is just one reason to visit the Royal Gorge Bridge and Park. The bridge was the world's highest suspension bridge and still is, as a matter of fact. It was constructed in 1929 over a five month period. Its length is 1,260 feet, width 18 feet, and the main span is 880 feet. The towers stand 150 feet high with 2,100 strands and NO. 9 galvanized wire. The cables weigh 300 tons. About 1,000 tons of steel was used to construct the floor of the bridge. The walkway has 1,292 planks of deck, and they usually replace 250 annually. To build the bridge they used $350,000, but it has taken $20 million to keep it in shape over the years."

More than two decades have been dedicated to creating a destination for hut to hut travel by mountain bike and while skiing. Joe Ryan and a friend where inspired in the development of a hut system while vacationing in Canada. The United States did not have a hut system that could be utilized all year long at the time and the two thought it was a good idea. The friend that Ryan had taken the trip with died during an avalanche and the plans were placed on hold. The San Juan Hut Systems were created during 1987 on Sneffels Range's northern slope. The slope is located in Uncompahgre National Forest which allows access to the wildness of Sneffells and incredible options for skiing. There are five huts that connect the Ouray, Ridgway, and Telluride in the Dallas Trails historic system. There is separate access to the huts provided by their own trailheads providing the ability to ski between huts or make reservations to stay in a hut for a number of days. When the San Juan Hut System was first built the huts had to be taken down when the ski season ended according to the permits. The first attempts were difficult due to there not being a source of income during the summer and a lack of storage facilities for the huts make it difficult. The first trails begin in Telluride and transitioned through a number of geographic and climatic zones before stopping in Moab, Utah. There was a second route developed to Moab, Utah from Durango, Colorado fifteen years after the first trails were developed. There are over sixty miles of trails and backcountry skiing accessible with the winter San Juan Hut System. The systems offers two routes for mountain biking that are two hundred and fifteen miles long. The huts can also be utilized for special events such as reunions or other gatherings.

"Skyline Drive","Colorado","Skyline Drive, Canon City, CO","Canon City, Colorado offers one of the most scenic drives in North America. Going into the city is your typical highway, until you get further into town. At the juncture of US Highway 50 and Skyline Drive, visitors will pick up the one way road. The entrance is about 3 miles west of Canon City proper. The road is also three miles long. During the early 20th century Skyline Drive was built by prison inmates. The drive will take you several hundred feet up to the ridge that overlooks the city, gorge, and Arkansas River Valley. You will even be able to get to the suspension bridge from Skyline Drive, which allows you to see an amazing site below. The views from the ridge are breathtaking and even considered a geological marvel. There are numerous switchback areas below that one can enjoy. Skyline Drive is known for more than just the scenic views it can offer, especially as one gets closer to the gorge. The drive has also been a highlight for paleontologists. Many dinosaur tracks are still embedded in the rocks surrounding the drive. In fact visitors are able to take a drive to the Dinosaur Depot to see some of the specimens which have been pulled out of areas near Skyline Drive. At one of the pull offs visitors do not even have to get too far off the road to see dinosaur tracks in rock. Skyline is not for those who have never experienced a high road with cliff edges. It can be quite thrilling for those who seek adventure. A small car or truck is best, and the road should not be attempted by motor homes due to the grade of the road and the sudden turns required. Most of the road also does not have guardrails, which means visitors can peer out of the car directly down, and get a sense of what it was like to travel the road in the early 1900's, when cars were a little less sure footed. It is best to take the speed limit at heart to avoid any issues. There are a number of pull offs for the views and to catch your breath from the twisting road. Skyline Drive ends at Floral and Fifth, which is a residential neighborhood leading into Canon City. It is quite easy to find your way back to Highway 50th, and the various amusements the highway has nearby. For those who want to visit the Dinosaur Depot, Railroad to the Gorge, or the little shops it is best to get back on Highway 50 and take it downtown to these places. Skyline Drive is a very popular trip for local residents, and should not be missed while one is in the area, as long as you can enjoy the high drive. Along the way it is possible to see some very unique geological features, as well as the river way below. On this drive red rock with a few plants and trees await."
"Skyline Drive","Colorado","Skyline Drive, Canon City, CO - Drive","When driving through the area of the Royal Gorge, you will certainly want to turn on to the Skyline Drive near Canon City, CO, for the breathtaking view over the area. This high road will give you opportunity to see tremendous views all along the drive and it is sure to give you many excellent camera shots. Skyline Drive runs along Route 50 just above Canon City. It goes for three miles and rises to 800 feet above the city, giving travelers some beautiful views of the surrounding area and of the Sangre Mountains. Many people also like to walk the distance for a good workout. The original road was built by prisoners in 1903, and there is a prison that can be seen on the way back down. Later, in the 1930's, the road was first paved. Because of the narrowness of the road in places, it only allows for one-way traffic. In places, there are steep drop-offs on both sides of the road, so care will need to be given while driving on this road. The Skyline Drive is on top of what is called a hogback, which is simply a narrow ridge - like on the backs on some wild hogs. There are a number of pull-offs along the route so that people can have a perfect opportunity to just sit down and enjoy the view, or take pictures of the unforgettably beautiful scenery. Along the drive, there is also a place where dinosaur footprints can be seen on the rockface. These were discovered by a student in 1999, who was walking along the Drive. The road was closed down for a few months while a team of archeologists and others performed research on them. These footprints can be viewed by stopping along the first parkway and then taking a short walk back. The rock layers there had turned sideways so that you can see them vertically, instead of flat on the ground. Much of the rock in this area has been turned to the vertical position. Apart from this hogback, there are also other ones nearby. The vertical rock formations can also be seen at places like Garden of the Gods, Stonewall, and in the Roxborough Park. While you are in this area, visitors will certainly also want to see the Royal Gorge, which is not far away. The Gorge has the world's highest suspension bridge and it traverses a chasm that is more than 1,000 feet down. The Arkansas River runs through the Gorge and a train runs along one side of it. Tickets can be purchased that will let you drive over the bridge - or walk across it. A tram car is also there which goes across it as well. Train rides are also available - with dinner or lunch - and they can be purchased as a package, letting guests see this amazing beautiful place from both the bridge and the train. Other attractions are also in the area of the Skyline Drive at Canon City, CO, and you will want to see them all. This includes the Wapiti Western Wildlife Park, which will let the family enjoy seeing Rocky Mountain Elk, American Bison, and Big Horn Sheep."

"The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad","Colorado","The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad - Durango, CO - a historic railroad still in operation","The D&SNG or Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Durango, Colorado is a thirty-six inch, forty-five mile railroad track that runs between Silverton and Durango. It is a National Historic Landmark in addition to being a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built the tracks between the years of 1881 and 1882. The original purpose of the railroad was to carry the gold and silver mined out of the San Juan Mountains. It was used to extend the D&RG line that ran to Durango from Antonito. Since 1881 the trains going to Silverton from Durango have ran consistently while the other lines were shut down one by one. The line is now a tourist attraction that carries passengers instead of mined minerals. It is one of the few railroad lines in the U.S. to be used for steam locomotives continually. The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad was formed when the line was sold by Denver & Rio Grande Western during the first part of 1981. Some of the operating trains go all the way back to the 1880's. The route for the trains during the summer is from Durango to Silverton and to Cascade Wye from Durango during the winter months. Denver and Rio Grande Railroad was built by William Jackson Palmer a former employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Palmer believed the Colorado Mountains required narrow gauge rails to allow the trains to maneuver. Durango, Colorado which was founding during 1880 by D&RG got the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad on the 5th of August during 1881. During 1882 Silverton got the railroad. The trains began running immediately. There were additional narrow gauge tracks leading out of Silverton during 1887. There ten mine closings during 1893 due to a drop in the price of silver. The town of Durango was nearly destroyed in a fire during 1889 and by 1902 a train brought the first automobile to the town. A National Park was made out of Mesa Verde during 1906 which increased the area's tourist appeal. The next two decades were a difficult time for the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad due to floods, war, and other troubles. Operational control for the railroad was assumed by the United States Government when it entered into World War I and the railroad was reorganized a short while later because of money problems. The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad increased the tourist appeal through the 1980's. The trains were weatherized to make them more comfortable in the winter and there was a third train added to the route to Silverton in addition to a fourth train that acted as an alternate to Cascade Canyon Wye. Approximately ten thousand ties were replaced in the track during a major reconstruction. Four trains traveled the Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad to Silverton an a fifth was added to Cascade Canyon Wye by the late 1980's. First American Railways purchased the D&SNG from Charles Bradshaw Jr. during 1997. A year later American Heritage Railways purchased it."

The construction on a line to Silverton started in the fall of 1882 and the tracks were completed to Silverton by August of 1881. At this time freight and passengers began traveling by the train. While the train was designed primarily for the hauling of gold and silver away from the San Juan Mountains it was promoted as a scenic passenger route from the beginning. Today the railroad provides daily service from May to October to Silverton and to the Cascade Canyon from November to the first part of May. It is suggested that those wishing to take the train to see the country side and enjoy a part of history make the reservation in advance. The Durango yard is where the museum is located.

"Tin Cup Mining Company","Colorado","Tin Cup Mining Company","Tin Cup Mining Company came about in 1861 when Jim Taylor and two travelling companions stopped at the creek in Tin Cup for a drink, when they noticed gold at the bottom of their cups.   The town started mining silver and gold in the 1870s and was taken to the railroad to go to the smelters by mules and wagons. Many items were very expensive when the gold rush was at its height. Men would ski or snowshoe to get supplies then make a large profit when selling those items to other miners. Tin Cup was one of the wildest mining camps in Colorado. There were many saloons, including Frenchy's Place where gamblers controlled everything. The gamblers hired marshals under a hear nothing; see nothing policy so that visitors to the town thought it was a place of law and order. The town of Tin Cup became a ghost town after mining finished. Now there are many summer homes in the town and is also a tourist attraction. Places of interest include the cemetery which has been divided into four sections, Protestant Knoll, Jewish Knoll, Catholic Knoll and Boot Hill Knoll, some markers remain in Boot Hill Knoll such as 'Black' Jack Cameron who 'drew 5 Aces'. Some of the homes of Tin Cup have been restored and are used as summer homes, which provide mountain views and lots of wildlife. The fire hydrants that were installed in 1891 can still be seen to this day."
"Tiny Town","Colorado","Tiny Town, Denver, CO - Attraction","The creation of Tiny Town in Denver, CO took place about a century ago - in 1915. At that time, the owner of a moving company, George Turner, began constructing houses that were one-sixth size. He made them originally for his daughter, but later opened them up to the public just five years later. In another five years, the attraction had become one of Colorado's favorite. There are a wide variety of buildings in Tiny Town, some of them are very unique. The village is built in a valley and it is designed after an old Western town. All of them, of course, are amazingly detailed. You can expect to see houses, hotels, churches, stores, and businesses. Some of the businesses that you will see replicas of include Stanley Mill, The Fort, Arvada Flour Mill, Argo Gold Mill, Coney Island Hot Dog, and the Victorian fire station in Denver (Station #1). A special railway was created for the town in 1939. This made it even more popular than ever. The train is also one-sixth size and is the perfect size to take families around the little town. Visitors can now ride the tiny train on a one-mile course. There are a couple of different engines - both steam and diesel. The train ride takes about 10 minutes and goes over Turkey Creek, Tweety Town and past Dinosaur Hill. One of the engines that is occasionally at Tiny town is called the 1904 Cagney. This engine was first run in the 1904 world's fair that was held in St. Louis. A machine shop nearby actually did the machine work on the engine enabling it to run again. After a couple of floods, the town had nearly been destroyed. There were more than 125 buildings at that time. Over time, different groups have helped rebuild some of the houses and buildings so that now there are nearly 100 of them - all of them built one-sixth size. The houses are very detailed and the kids can look in the windows and see what is inside each of the furnished houses. This year something new happened that had not been done in Tiny Town since 1989. The town was lit up with Christmas lights in an effort to bring some hope to people who had been hurt from the economic problems in our country. The lighted houses can be seen from the road, and pictures can be taken. The town is still growing. One building that people can expect to see soon is the Tara from Gone with the Wind. This is actually replacing an earlier Tara that had been destroyed in a flood. Other important landmarks around Denver can also be seen in Tiny Town. Some of the buildings are also imaginary. Some of the buildings can also be crawled into, giving the children even more fun. When the family has finished seeing the town and going on the train, there is a large playground for them. A gift shop offers many different items for souvenirs and other train-related items. A concession stand offers ice cream, hot dogs, and other refreshments. Or, you may want to pack your own lunch and have a picnic on the playground. It would be a great way to end a tour of Tiny Town. The Tiny Town is located about 30 minutes from the downtown area of Denver. It is open from May through September between the hours of 10 AM to 5 PM. In the months of May and September, however, it is only open on weekends, between 10 AM until 5: PM."

"Trail Ridge Road","Colorado","Trail Ridge Road - Rocky Mountain National Park, CO - A highway through Rocky Mountain National Park","A portion of the U.S Highway 34 which is the highest of the U.S.'s continuous highway is known as the Beaver Meadow National Scenic Byway or Trail Ridge Road. Trail Ridge Road expands over fifty miles to the east into Grand Lake, Colorado from Estes Park, Colorado all the way through the Rocky Mountain National Park. Near the Fall River Pass the elevation of the road is over eleven thousand feet and its highest point is over twelve thousand feet. The road runs all the way across the Continental Divide at Milner Pass. The snowpack on the road determines how long it is closed. The Trail Ridge Road can remain closed until summer when it is closed for the winter. The road begins at the Grand Lake Entrance of the Rocky Mountain National Park's Kawuneeche Visitor Center and heads north along the North Fork of the Colorado River though Kawuneeche Valley. The Colorado River Trailhead is part of the road that gets closed for the winter. There are a number of trailheads that are found along this portion of the road. The Trail Ridge Road turns into a series of winding curves as it turns to the east and gets higher when it passes the Colorado River Trailhead. There is a view of the Never Summer Mountains and the Kawuneeche Valley from the overlook located at Farview Curve. The Trail Ridge Road goes over the Continental Divide with the Milner Pass and goes around the Medicine Bow Curve before it joins Fall River Road near the Alpine Visitor Center at the Fall River Pass.

The Rocky Mountain National Park got its first road through the highest portions of the mountains when the road was opened during 1921. The single grade road was not adequate for travel by car with the steep grades, short season and tight curves. Additional construction was begun on the Trail Ridge Road during 1926 to make it easier to travel. Today the Trail Ridge Road is popular with motorcyclists. Anyone visiting the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado should make it a point to travel along the Trail Ridge Road and explore the sites along the way.

"Trails in Dinosaur, CO - Hiking","Colorado","Trails in Dinosaur, CO - Hiking","In the northwest corner of Colorado, there is a little known wilderness that is home to many trails and untouched areas. The nearest town, called Dinosaur, CO, is also the westernmost community in the entire state - just three miles from the Utah border. Years ago, in 1909, there were many dinosaur skeletons found in this area, and a small portion of the park was set aside to preserve it. Later, the area was expanded to protect part of the area around the two rivers. This area is unusual because the Yampa River and the Green River are totally different. Together, the area offers many miles of trails through different terrain and it is still largely untouched. The park was designated the Dinosaur National Monument in 1938, and includes 210,000 acres. A number of trails offer hikers the opportunity to see the land around these two beautiful rivers. The Park crosses over into Utah. Altogether, the park includes forty-four miles of the Green River, and forty-eight miles of the Yampa River. One of the great features of the Park is that there is a natural exhibit of dinosaur bones - more than 1,600 of them. Part of an ancient river bed with these bones has become exposed in a wall. They now make up one wall of an exhibit in the Dinosaur Quarry Visitor Center. If you just want to see some of the highlights of the park, you can see them in your car, too. There are two different self-guided auto tours that you can take on your own. One of them starts out at the Dinosaur Quarry Visitor Center, and is called the Tour of the Tilted Rocks.''

It starts out near the Monument Headquarters Visitor Center, and winds around for 62 miles of some spectacular scenery. The road goes along the Blue Mountain Plateau, and you will pass several scenic overlooks, several nature trails, and passes into the steep and unpaved Echo Park.

The Mint in Denver started producing coins in 1906, but it did not start there. The current building is actually the third one that was handling money - often in gold and silver. In the early days of the Colorado Gold Rush, miners had no place to bring their gold. Businessmen opened the first building for the purpose of minting gold coins. This business was later purchased by the government in 1863 - during the Civil War. It turned gold and silver into bars for the next 50 years - but no coins were made. Finally, in 1906, it began producing pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. For a while it also produced coins for Mexico, Israel and Argentina, but stopped in 1984. Besides manufacturing the lower denomination coins, the Mint is also responsible to produce proofs for coin collectors and coins of special metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The Mint also produces official medals, too. Tours allow people to go into the Mint and see the processes involved. They do not actually go into the spaces where the coins are being produced, but can view the processes from above. This allows visitors to be able to see everything going on unhindered. Tours of the Mint are free. They are limited to about 50 people per tour and it is better if reservations are made in advance. Groups of 20 people or less can make reservations online, but groups between 20 to 50 people must call in their reservation. Although people may be permitted in who do not have a reservation (standby tickets are offered at the door), they may only be allowed in if another group cancels, or if there is room and the 50 person limit is not met. Reservations can be made online. The United States Mint is under the auspices of Homeland Security and precautions are in force. This means that every person must go through scanners and many items are not permitted. They are rather strict and the list may change of what is permitted and what is not. Be sure to go online to find the current list. Backpacks are not allowed, nor are carry bags - including diaper bags, to name just a few. Cameras are not permitted. A gift shop contains a number of items, especially those that encourage saving and collecting coins. Other merchandise relating to the Mint is also available, such as T-shirts, books, and piggy banks. No coins are sold at the gift shop. All collectors' coins and sets must be purchased online. Tours are given on an hourly basis. They are offered from 8 AM until 2 PM on Monday through Friday. The United States Mint in Denver, CO is wheelchair accessible.
