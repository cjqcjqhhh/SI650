"10 - Omni Bedford Springs Resort - Bedford, PA - Resort","Pennsylvania","10 - Omni Bedford Springs Resort - Bedford, PA - Resort","The large and luxurious Omni Bedford Springs Resort has been around for over 200 years. Being just two hours away from Washington, it is the ideal place to get away. The land that the Omni Bedford Springs Resort now sits on - all 2,200 acres of it - was purchased in 1796 from the Indians by Dr. John Anderson because of its natural springs and their healing properties. The Indians were already using it for this purpose. Dr. Anderson soon built his home here and then started offering spas and treatments for visitors according to their particular needs. It rapidly became known for its spas and healing springs. Eventually, the Resort would become known as a place for the rich and famous. As many as 10 Presidents of the United States would visit. President Buchanan even made the resort his summer White House while he was in office. The Resort was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1984. Just two years later it was closed. After a very extensive restoration in which its original splendor would be restored, at a cost of $120 million, it was then reopened to visitors in 2007. The Resort has reopened after seeking to combine the best of technology and its original splendor. There are 216 guestrooms and suites, and every room has a balcony and flat-panel television. There is both an outdoor pool and a heated indoor pool that uses mineral water from the eight mineral springs. A 30,000 square foot Springs Eternal Spa is ready to receive guests looking for treatments from the mineral springs. A state-of-the-art fitness center with professional staff is also available to help get or stay in shape. A world class 18-hole golf course has been a feature of the Resort for many years. In fact, it had one of the first few golf courses in the country. A.W. Tillinghaust and later Donald Ross worked to design the present course. Jogging trails are available and so are outdoor tennis courts. Nearby, activities such as horseback riding, snow skiing, and shopping are also available at a nearby mall. The Shawnee State Park is just 12 miles away. There is also a state-of the-art conference center on the grounds. This building provides 20,000 square feet of meeting space with all the latest features needed to host most any conference. There are 13 different meeting rooms and the largest one will hold 4,800 people. On the Resort grounds, there are over 25 miles of biking and hiking trails. Trout fishing is also available on the property. For dining pleasure, there are 5 restaurants providing regional cuisine. The Resort is a popular place for weddings, too.

Special facilities are available to make it the perfect event, such as their Outdoor Wedding Chapel, the Wedding Grotto - A White Gazebo at the Magnesia Spring, the Grand Ballroom with Veranda, the Eisenhower Room with Fireplace, and more special choice spots, as well. The Omni Bedford Springs Resort is located in the northern part of the Cumberland Valley, and it is surrounded by the Allegheny Mountains.

"A Moving Tribute to Those on Flight 93","Pennsylvania","A Moving Tribute to Those on Flight 93","Shortly after the events of September 11, 2001, the fifth through eighth grades students at the Spring Valley School in Farmington decided they wanted to pay homage to those who had lost their lives in the crashing of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The students turned an old bar into a memorial and handcrafted benches to honor each passenger who was on the plane. The barn is now a museum dedicated to peace featuring artwork and memorials of those who have been the victims of war and terror. Visiting the barn is a somber event, but it is a good side trip if you are in the Farmington area or visiting Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water attraction nearby. Reflecting on the events that changed the country is a moving experience, and it is advisable that you speak with children before and after about their experience at the barn. The Peace Barn features the commemorative materials for those involved with Flight 93 but there are also images that encourage people to consider a world without war. Natural disaster information is also part of the display. The exhibits highlight artwork from members of the community, and the Spring Valley commune. There are also materials depicting the stories of the victims of the Tsunami disaster in Thailand and Hurricane Katrina in Mississippi. When visiting the barn you will more than likely interact with a few members of the group. Students are sometimes available to give guided tours of the barn, and may be one of the students who helped conceptualize and create the memorial. There are approximately 300 people who live on the commune and they are happy to share information about their lifestyle and experiences. The Bruderhof communities exist in Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. They are a group of Christians and their name is German for place of brothers. They have recently changed their name to Church Communities International. The group began in 1920 in Germany and their community in Pennsylvania was founded in 1957. Bruderhof individuals do not own private property but exist in commune style living. Their children are not automatically members, and those born into Bruderhof families are encouraged to explore their religious and spiritual beliefs before committing to the faith. The main income for the community comes from their creation and sale of Community Playthings, a line of classroom furniture handcrafted and sold by the members. They participate in a number of outreach programs including prison visits with the incarcerated. The surrounding area of Farmington offers visitors a number of activities they can enjoy before or after their visit to the memorial. Keep in mind you may be spiritually burdened after a visit to the barn, so it is advisable you and your loved ones eat a leisurely meal in town, discuss what you learned, and take it easy for a few hours following your trip. There are several hotels and overnight accommodations if you decide to stay in town. This is a peaceful trip and those who have a curiosity about the Bruderhof people or the events in Shanksville on September 11th are encouraged to visit."

"Brandywine River Museum","Pennsylvania","Brandywine River Museum - Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania - art, culture, and environmental museum featuring the Brandywine River Valley","The Brandywine River Museum, which is part of the Brandywine Conservancy, is located in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. In the 1960s, this area was threatened by industrial development, so a group of residents came together to purchase much of the land, protecting over five miles along the Brandywine River. The museum was opened in 1971 in Hoffman's Mill, a restored gristmill from the 1860s. This museum houses a large collection of local and American art, including the work of the famous Wyeth family, who lived in the Brandywine area. The Wyeth collection is one of the most popular exhibits at the Brandywine River Museum, since the collection here is unlike any found at any other art gallery. The patriarch of the Wyeth family was Newell Convers Wyeth (N.C. Wyeth), who was a student of Howard Pyle and completed over 3,000 painting and illustrations during his lifetime. He died in 1945, but a number of other members of the Wyeth family have also become artists, and some of their works are included as part of the Brandywine River Museum as well. Visitors can see N.C. Wyeth's original home and art studio not far from the mill that plays home to the museum. In addition, the museum houses collections of art including works by Pyle, Jasper Francis Corpsey, Harvey Dunn, William Trost Richards, and a number of other artists. Because N.C. Wyeth was such a prolific illustrator, the Brandywine River Museum has a large collection of illustrations from other artists as well. Many of these artists are well known in the world of art for their work, and some that are on display at the museum include Maxfield Parrish, Nancy Eckholm Burkert, Dr. Seuss, Edwin Austin Abbey, and Reginald Marsh. This collection also includes cartoonists from the late 20th century, such as Charles Schulz, Al Hirschfeld, and Charles Addams. For those researching art, the Brandywine River Museum is an important American resource. Their library has nearly 3,500 volumes, and in addition to those books, there are over 22,000 other items, which include artist portfolios, films, phonographs, posters, scrapbooks, book jackets, and other works important to artists. The library is open by appointment only, but anyone interested in American art can schedule time to research at this location. The Brandywine River Museum has a number of educational opportunities for visitors of all ages. Throughout the year, they have lectures to introduce new collections or individual pieces of art. These programs are free with museum admission. There are also programs for children, including read-aloud tours for families, and children's days that focus on illustrations for children's books. The museum also sponsors school programs and education for teachers. Admission to the Brandywine River Museum costs $10 for adults and $6 for students and senior citizens.

It opens on Wednesdays from 7am to 2pm, Thursday and Friday 7am to 5pm and on Saturday from 7am to 4pm. There are 200 free parking spaces around the property although this can be very busy around lunch times, and there is also street parking available, which is free on Saturdays. Founded in 1860 the market has had a rich history and was built and operated as a private business. The market farmers helped to feed 300,000 Union soldiers, who had stopped at the nearby Camp Curtin during the Civil War. Its peak period was in the 1920s when there were over 725 vendors, many of whom had to set up stalls outside whilst they waited several years for an indoor stall to become available. Having banned outdoor vending some years ago, this practice is now permitted again in the market courtyard. The market has been owned by the City of Harrisburg since 1979, which has financed and overseen restoration to the complex and market house. It is operated under local community management in the guise of the Broad Street Market Corporation, which is an enterprise owned by the Historic Harrisburg Association. Nearly 40 vendors are now set up at the market buildings. The Stone Market Building was completed back in 1863 and is where most of the prepared food vendors are set up. The 1870s built Brick Market Building is the larger of the two buildings with a rich array of locally grown produce and a variety of other items for sale. The majority of vendors at the Stone Market building are selling food hailing from many different cultures across the world with a choice of places to sit and dine. Some are concentrated on fairly simple fare from sandwiches, cakes, dried fruits and nuts to cheese steaks, salads and California style Mexican food. Asian cuisine is strongly embraced here too with Indian curries and Vietnamese, Thai and Korean dishes, whilst a taste of Italian and the Caribbean can also be found here. The Brick Market building has many stalls selling locally produced meats, vegetables, dairy products plus beverages and sweet and savoury items. There are also a couple of vendors selling plants and flowers or a craft stall with flower arrangements and special event decorating services. Visitors will also find items for the home such as furnishing, carpets and art and whilst there are also novelty gifts, natural body products and herbals are on sale here too. On Saturdays there are more vendors outside the two buildings selling hand made jewelry, T-shirts as well as live music and the occasional health fair. Visitors often find the vendors are knowledgeable and helpful, whilst encouraging people to sample their food. Towards the end of the day it is often possible to negotiate the price with some of the vendors, who are keen to clear their stock."

"Carnegie Mellon University: ``My Heart is in the Work''","Pennsylvania","Carnegie Mellon University: ``My Heart is in the Work''","  Andrew Carnegie was the son of a poor Scottish family, but he went on to accomplish many great things in his life. One of his most lasting contributions was the creation of what is now Carnegie Mellon University. Founded in 1900, the school was originally called Carnegie Technical Schools. A merger with Mellon Institute of Industrial Research in 1967 gave the school its current name. Carnegie Mellon University is home to 10,000 students and the school boasts over 70,000 alumni. With an admission rate of only 28% for the class of 2011, Carnegie Mellon is quite particular about the students that are admitted. Currently, the student body is made up of scholars from 93 countries. The university consists of seven schools. They are the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Tepper School of Business, College of Fine Arts, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Heinz College, Mellon College of Science and the School of Computer Science. The university is as rich in tradition as it is in academic excellence. Students take part in traying'' each winter by using dining hall trays as sleds on the campus hills. Other traditions include a carnival that is held each spring and includes the annual Buggy Sweepstakes in which students show off buggies that they have spent the entire academic year building. Another of the university traditions is a nod to the Scottish roots of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie Mellon is the only university at which students can earn a degree in the bagpipes. The Pipe Band performs at all formal school events. Each university president has found a way to leave his mark on the campus and the current president, Jared Cohon, is no exception.  Cohon left Yale University to take the position of president at Carnegie Mellon in 1997. Since then he has overseen the building of the first green'' (a building designed to have minimal impact on the environment) dormitory in the United States. Another effort aimed at helping the environment was the creation of a living roof atop one of the campus buildings. The official motto of the university is My heart is in the work'', and the school has, and will surely continue, to make important contributions to society in a number of areas."

If lost, visitors can talk to one of the two Maze Masters'' to get back on track, so there's no need to worry about getting frustrated. From an aerial view, the cornfield's paths are cut to create elaborate designs, and along the way, guests will go over bridges, find water stations, and go through tunnels. It typically takes around one hour to get through the maze. The Maize Maze isn't the only thing to do at Cherry Crest Adventure Farm. At The Courtyard, families can ride the Cherry Crest Express wagon through a cornfield, take the 20-minute farm wagon tour, rent a pedal kart to drive around one of the cornfield racetracks, feed a number of animals at the petting zoo, taste candies at the fudge shop, hold baby chicks at the hatchery, visit the education center, and try one of the brain teasing rope mazes.

"Chestnut Street in Philadelphia Provides Great Shopping and More","Pennsylvania","Chestnut Street in Philadelphia Provides Great Shopping and More","	Chestnut Street in Philadelphia is an east-west thoroughfare that makes its way through the downtown area, stretching from the riverfront in the east all the way to the western portion of the city. The most notable blocks of Chestnut Street are those that run through the historic area in Center City. Just east of Independence Hall, there are several historic sites situated along Chestnut Street, just one of several streets in the city named after varieties of nuts. The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1824 and 1841, sits at 4th and Chestnut Streets. The beautiful Greek Revival building was designed by architect William Strickland and today contains a collection of portraits of some of the early leaders in the fight for independence. At 3rd and Chestnut is the New Hall Military Museum. Built in 1791, today it houses a collection of artifacts relating to early American military history. Across from that museum is the Philadelphia Marine Museum, which tells the history of shipping on the Delaware River. Yet another military museum, the Army-Navy Museum, is located in the historic Pemberton House. Most notable, however, is Carpenter's Hall, where the First Continental Congress met in 1774. It now houses a museum dedicated to the craft of carpentry. In 1976, the city of Philadelphia turned 12 blocks of Chestnut Street into a pedestrian mall. This was done in time for the July 4th Bicentennial celebration that took place in downtown Philadelphia. The mall would stretch from 6th to 18th Streets and would include expanded sidewalks, pedestrian crosswalks located mid-block, specially designed lighting, bus shelters, planters, and some seating. No cars would be allowed to traverse Chestnut Street for those 12 blocks. The city spent about $7.4 million on the project. The pedestrian mall was a hit for more than 20 years, but auto traffic was restored to the area in the late 1990s due to severe traffic snarls in that portion of downtown. While this part of Chestnut Street is no longer for pedestrians only, it is still a prime shopping area. Situated along this part of the street are numerous stores including both familiar chain apparel stores and boutique shops with unique clothing, accessories, and other items. The street is also lined with other kinds of stores including a few souvenir shops peddling a wide variety of Philly-themed merchandise. There are also quite a few restaurants located along Chestnut Street, particularly in the area that was once the pedestrian mall. Take-out, bistro-type eateries, and formal sit-down restaurants can all be found along Chestnut. After the street stretches past 18th Street, it becomes a typical city street, dotted with a variety of stores, services, hospitals, and businesses, including Liberty Place One and Two, two of the tallest buildings in the city. As it travels further west into the area known as West Philadelphia, Chestnut Street crosses the Schuylkill River and becomes a populous residential street."

Originally founded in 1983, the first home of the museum was the old Allegheny Post Office. It was joined in 1991 by the Buhl Planetarium, an attraction that was once part of the Carnegie Science Center. In 2000, plans were announced to further expand the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh in order to accommodate the grower number of visitors. A modern glass addition was designed that would connect the two buildings - the Art Deco-style former post office and the Beaux Arts planetarium. The new structure was the winner of a Silver LEED award, a nod to the fact that the new addition was built using sustainable building methods with attention to site development, water conservation, energy management, using recycled materials, waste management, reusing resources, and indoor air quality. By leaving some of the green'' systems exposed, the museum offers opportunities to teach young visitors about their responsibility to the environment. Additional awards garnered by the new Children's Museum of Pittsburgh include an architectural achievement award and a National Trust for Historic Preservation award for preserving the integrity of the original buildings. Children and their parents head to this museum, however, not for its architecture but for what's inside. Through its exhibits, the museum strives to inspire joy, creativity, and curiosity in its young visitors and to work as a resource for those who care for and work with young children. The permanent exhibits at the Pittsburgh Children's Museum are based on the theme Play with Real Stuff''. Each exhibit includes an area for older children and a section for toddlers and infants. These exhibits include The Studio, an arts-related area where kids can experiment with printmaking, papermaking, painting, clay sculpture, and more. Inexpensive and recycled materials are on hand for such projects as mosaics, wire sculptures, and weaving. Other exhibits offered at this museum include The Attic, a space where kids can challenge their senses in the Gravity Room or Phosphorescent Room or make puppets in the Animateering workshop. The Garage and Workshop is truly a hands-on area, where kids learn about electrical systems, pulleys, parachutes, and much more. At The Theater, kids are the stars. They can try their hand at dressing up or can experiment at the actors' make-up table, then present their own play in the kid-sized theater. One of the favorite exhibits in the museum is Welcome to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,'' a tribute to Pittsburgh's favorite native son. Kids can see Mr. Rogers' television house, the Neighborhood of Make Believe, and the Neighborhood Trolley. Any Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood fan will adore this section of the museum where they can meet King Friday, Daniel Striped Tiger, and other neighborhood favorites. Kids will get wet at the popular Waterplay exhibit, where they can launch a boat on the river''. More opportunity to get wet and dirty happens in the Backyard, where visitors can roll down a hill or splash in a fountain. Temporary exhibits are also featured regularly and the museum also offers many special programs and events for children and their parents or guardians. Summer camps for grades 1-8 are also offered annually. The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh also holds classes for educators. The museum is open daily and there is a caf, onsite for hungry visitors.

"Christ Church is a Must-See Philadelphia Historic Landmark","Pennsylvania","Christ Church is a Must-See Philadelphia Historic Landmark","	Christ Church is an historic Episcopalian church located in the historic section of Philadelphia, close to Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, and Franklin Court. The second church on that sight built by the early Philadelphia congregation, the current church was erected between 1727 and 1744 and is considered to be one of the finest remaining examples of 18th century ecclesiastic structures. Constructed in the Georgian style, it is an excellent example of colonial craftsmanship. The church was the first Protestant Episcopal Church in the country, which makes it the birthplace of the Episcopal Church in America. The early rectors of the Christ Church congregation also played important roles in the in the history of the U.S. in general. Rector Jacob Duche led the opening prayers at the First Continental Congress in 1774 and the Reverend William White was chaplain to both the Continental Congress and the United States Senate during the Revolutionary War. White was also responsible for much of the first American Book of Common Prayer, a manuscript that would remain in use for many decades. Christ Church is a National Historic Landmark. Inside, the approximately 250,000 visitors per year can view an elegant interior with fluted columns and handsome boxed pews. The baptismal font inside the church is the one in which William Penn was baptized in England. It came to the church from All Hallows-by-the-Tower Anglican Church in London. The early congregation at Christ Church was prestigious, including 15 individuals who signed the Declaration of Independence. Guests today can visit their designated pews, including Pew 56 for George Washington and Pew 70 for Benjamin Franklin. Betsy Ross also worshipped here, though she was assigned a lesser pew with an obstructed view of the pulpit. The Second Continental Congress also worshipped here as a group in 1775-76. Franklin was also integral in securing financing for the church's landmark steeple (196 feet) and bells, which were added to the structure in 1754. Guides are available to give escorted tours of the church throughout the day. Tours are free of charge but a donation is requested, which assists with the upkeep of the historic structure. Because the church is still an operating Episcopalian congregation, it closes on occasion to accommodate Sunday services, weddings, and funerals. Pre-registration is suggested for group tours. Christ Church Burial Ground is also an interesting tourist attraction. It is the final resting place for many notable early Philadelphians, including Benjamin Franklin and four other signers of the Declaration of Independence - Francis Hopkinson, Joseph Hewes, George Ross, and Dr. Benjamin Rush. Guided tours of the burial ground are available for a small fee or visitors may obtain a map and tour on their own. However, an admission fee is still required. Weekday hours are quite limited. Reservations for groups should be made in advance. Because this is a place of worship, visitors are asked to please abide by church rules when visiting. Photographs are permitted unless otherwise noted. Guests are asked to refrain from loud talking and other distracting behaviors."

"City Hall in Philadelphia is a Second Empire Masterpiece","Pennsylvania","City Hall in Philadelphia is a Second Empire Masterpiece","	Situated in the area known as Penn Square (sometimes Center Square), Philadelphia's magnificent City Hall is an architectural gem and the centerpiece of the downtown area. The tallest building in the city until Liberty Place was built in the 1980s, this National Historic Landmark stretches 510 feet in the air and is considered be the nation's finest example of French Second Empire architecture. Larger than the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, DC, City Hall in Philadelphia was the most expensive municipal building ever constructed. It took 30 years to build the structure, and by the time it was complete, the Second Empire style of architecture was outdated and many city officials deemed the building hideous. Still, most architectural buffs consider the building to be nothing short of a masterpiece of construction. John McArthur, Jr. became the architect for the project, winning a design contest announced in 1860 by local officials. However, the Civil War put a stop to all construction and the building did not commence until 1871, with the first foundation stone laid a year later. In 1873, famed sculptor Alexander Milne Calder began work on the building's elaborate statuary. The project occupied him for the next 20 years. Constant arguments over funding and other issues stretched out the project and caused large gaps in construction. McArthur died in 1890 and architect John Ord was appointed to take his place. Finally, in June 1901, City Hall was deemed complete and the building commission turned it over to the city though there was still some work to be done on the interior. Today, visitors can enjoy this incredible building both from the inside or the outside. Of particular interest on the exterior is the 510 foot tower that includes a huge clock with four faces and hands weighing in excess of 200 pounds each. The statues on the exterior of the building include four bronze eagles, each weighing 9,000 pounds with a wingspan of 15 feet; four figures including two Native Americans and two Swedish pioneers, all 24 feet tall; and the most famous of all the statues, that of William Penn, which stands atop the building, measuring 37 feet tall and weighing 54,000 pounds. For many years, the city maintained a rule that no building in the city could dwarf the Penn statue, until Mayor Wilson Goode broke the rule in 1987 and allowed Liberty Place One to greatly dwarf city hall, standing 945 feet tall. City officials allow Penn to don various articles of clothing, including hats, when a particular event is occurring, such as a notable sports championship for a city team. At Christmastime, a huge tree is placed in City Hall's courtyard and a variety of other events - concerts, European-style Christmas outdoor markets - are held in the area around the building. During other times of the year, other arts performances are presented and the hall is a prime area for protests of a variety of natures. Visitors can opt for a guided interior tour of City Hall in Philadelphia, offered once a day year round (with some additional times on occasion). Guests can also forego the tour and visit just the tower, which is accessible via an elevator from the 9th floor. Tours are free and last approximately 90 minutes. Timed tower tickets most be secured as the elevator holds only 5 people at one time. Tickets for all tours are available in the City Hall Information Office, Room 121, near the East entrance to the building."

"Clayton in Pittsburgh is a Historically Significant Home","Pennsylvania","Clayton in Pittsburgh is a Historically Significant Home","	Clayton is the name given to an Italianate style home in Pittsburgh that was once the family home of Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919), an industrialist and art collector who was a native of West Overton, Pennsylvania, a rural village about 40 miles from the city. The home was purchased by Frick and his wife Adelaide in 1883. The eleven-room home, originally dubbed Homewood, was situated in the East End neighborhood of the city and would be modified by the Fricks with the help of architect Andrew Peebles and renamed Clayton.'' The four Frick children would be born at the house within the next 10 years and the family would outgrow the home, later transforming it to a 23-room chateau-style mansion that visitors can tour today. Clayton would serve as the Frick family's primary residence until 1902, and today, the home functions as a museum and part of the Frick Art and Historical Center. It was given to the city of Pittsburgh upon the death of daughter Helen in 1984. Helen had founded the Frick Art Museum in 1970 in order to display her vast collection of art work and left provisions for the family home to be restored and opened to the public when she died. The city undertook four years worth of renovations and opened Clayton as a museum in 1990. A tour of Clayton provides a good look at late 19th century life, specifically for the privileged families of the era. Notable parts of the home include the Playhouse, which is now the Visitors Center. Built in 1897 for the Frick children, it was designed by architectural firm Alden and Harlow. The playhouse'' was more than just a room or two; it was the center of life for Childs, Martha, and Helen Frick. Childs used the upstairs as a dark room and Helen entertained friends in the drawing room. Old photos show large parties full of young people taking place there, and Childs, who went to a nearby private school, held military practice drills inside the playhouse. There was also a bowling alley on the first floor, which is still partially visible beneath the floor in the Museum Shop. Around the same time, a new greenhouse was added to Clayton. It would serve to satisfy Mrs. Frick's love of plants and flowers and provide fresh arrangements for the home on a regular basis. Guests can also visit the Car and Carriage Museum, once the Frick family's carriage house. Here, visitors can view the family's vast collection of carriages and cars, spanning several decades. The exhibits inside the museum also profile Pittsburgh's role in the growth of the American automobile industry. Visitors can also view plenty of period furnishings and other decorative arts, most of which were part of the home while the Fricks lived there. A high chair remains in the breakfast room and children's toys of the era are scattered throughout the house. Docent-led tours of Clayton are available every Tuesday through Sunday for a small fee. There is a gift shop and caf, on site."

"Cliveden in Philadelphia is a Notable Revolutionary War Attraction","Pennsylvania","Cliveden in Philadelphia is a Notable Revolutionary War Attraction","	Cliveden is a colonial estate that sits in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, an area that was once considered a suburb of the city. The estate was built between 1763 and 1767 by Benjamin Chew, a wealthy Philadelphian who was a loyalist, not a patriot. Chew had served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania before the war, but was imprisoned in New Jersey during the Revolutionary War because of his loyalty to the Crown of England. After the war, he became a patriot and went on to live a life of public service. The Cliveden Estate consists of 6 acres and now sits in the middle of a very busy ethnic neighborhood. During the war, dozens of British soldiers holed up in Cliveden during the Battle of Germantown in October 1777, which was fought on this land. The U.S. army lost that particular battle and more than 1,000 soldiers on both sides were killed or injuring during the fighting of this battle. Visitors to the home can still see the scars on the house, made by musket balls that hit the exterior. Many who died on Chew's property were buried there. Though Benjamin Chew sold the house in 1779, he repurchased it in 1797 and the home stayed in the Chew family until 1972, when the ownership of the property was transferred from the Chews to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Therefore, that same year, the historic home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Trust opened the doors of the historic estate to the public. Today, visitors can spend an afternoon touring the attractive home. Guided tours educate guests about the history and architecture of the home, the background of the Chew family and the many family members who lived there, and about the Battle of Germantown and the role that Cliveden played in that part of the Revolutionary War. Walk-in tours of the facility are offered from April through December. Cliveden is closed to walk-ins from January through March. However, adult groups of 45 people are less can schedule a tour of the home anytime during the year with advance reservations of at least 4 weeks. Special interest tours can be organized according to the interests of the group. For example, groups may request that military history or decorative arts be the focus of their tour. School groups are a common site at the estate, and docents offer to school children a variety of programs tailored to their age group, starting at about grade 2. The children's programs here are arranged in conjunction with the curriculum of the Philadelphia School District. A variety of special events are held annually at Cliveden including concerts, outdoor music festivals, and more. The historic trust also offers a Building Bridges'' day camp each summer for children who live in the neighborhood. The camp attempts to teach area youth the history of their neighborhood and includes time spent not only at Cliveden but also other historic sites in the Germantown area."

"Coral Caverns","Pennsylvania","Coral Caverns - Manns Choice, PA - Fossilized Coral Reef Cavern","The Coral Caverns are located in Bedford County at 121 Cavern Street #31 in Manns Choice, Pennsylvania. The entrance to the cavern is surrounded by limestone boulders, and railroad ties frame the entrance. The Coral Caverns contain a wealth of natural cave formations. One of the most remarkable features of the Coral Caverns is the coral reef, which is a towering fossil wall. Fossil remains of sea creatures can be seen in the fossil wall. Some of these fossil remains are thought to have been buried for more than 400 million years. The fossil wall contains coral that is shaped like seaworms, clams, and other creatures. The fossils and coral reefs date back to the Devonian Period. Coral Caverns has been educating and amazing visitors for over 75 years. Coral Caverns has the only fossilized coral reef cavern known to be in existence. Regular hours of operation for Coral Caverns are from 10:00am to 5:00pm. In July and August, the cavern is open 7 days a week. Coral Caverns is open on weekends only in May, June, September, and October. Coral Cavern is closed from November through April. Discounted rates are available for groups. For additional information on group discounts, interested parties can call 814-623-6882. The guided tour of Coral Caverns is approximately 30 minutes in length. Once inside the cavern, the pathway is lit by old black lanterns. Visitors are able to see cave ribbons, stalagmites, stalactites, and other formations. Visitors learn about the fragile cave coral that is also called cave popcorn. In a small back room of the cavern, there is a cave chimney. The cave chimney has been growing for so long that the height of the chimney hole has reached 60 feet. Coral Caverns has no natural openings, and the cave chimney could eventually lead to the first natural opening in the cavern. With how slow the formations form, it is said that it could take another 2,000 years for the cavern chimney to form the opening. A thin cement staircase is located nearby that leads up to the cavern's original entrance. Originally, miners discovered a small hole that was too small for an adult to fit through. The miners sought assistance, and three local boys volunteered to investigate. The boys were lowered down the small hole, and they explored the cave and reported back. In 1932, after roughly four years of preparations, the cavern was opened up for business and named Wonderland Coral Caverns. In later years, a safer entrance was dug and Wonderland'' was dropped from the cavern's name. Soda straws, which are thin hollow tubes, hang from the cavern's ceiling. A section of black volcanic rock evidences tectonic plate activity. Tight coils of helictites, which are gravity-defying growths, emerge horizontally from the cavern wall. The cavern maintains a consistent temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit, so visitors may want to take a light wrap, sweater, or jacket with them when they go to tour the cavern to avoid becoming chilled. Science and discovery are two of the focal points of the cavern and the interpretive tours offered. Pets are not permitted at Coral Caverns."

"Crystal Cave","Pennsylvania","Crystal Cave - Kutztown, Pennsylvania - natural cave system and tourist attraction","There is no shortage of attractions in Pennsylvania's famous Dutch country, but one of the most acclaimed is the Crystal Cave near Kutztown, in the heart of Amish country. Since its discovery in the 19th century, millions of visitors have marveled at the natural rock formations; in fact, the caves are the oldest operating in the state and are its most popular natural attraction. Like many other cave systems in the United States, Crystal Cave was discovered by accident; in this case by William Merkel and John Gehret, who were out blasting for limestone. They noticed a hole in the ground and after gathering together a small group to explore it, realized that the caves were extensive. They also found out, somewhat to their disappointment, that the crystals were not diamonds. Tourism and scientific research both took off in 1872, when a local man, Samuel Kohler purchased almost 50 acres of farm land around the caves as well as the caves themselves, becoming Pennsylvania's first full time cave operator. Despite the area's relative inaccessibility and the lack of a direct rail service, Kohler attracted visitors by creating pathways, installing lighting, railings and staircases and charging 25 cents to see the spectacular caves. The late 19th century saw increasing numbers of visitors; so many that Kohler had to build a small hotel on the site, although he frequently ended up accommodating guests in his own house as well. Kohler also realized the potential of marketing his investment; he printed colorful souvenir booklets and even held dances in the largest of the caves. The introduction of the car in the early 20th century made the caves more accessible and more popular; major improvements were made during the 1930s including the planting of thousands of trees. The unique formations in the caves have been formed over the centuries by slowly dripping water depositing crystals; some of the formations are estimated to be half a million years old. The names of some of the formations give an idea of the unique rock formations that can be seen - the Giant's Tooth, the Natural Bridge and the Cathedral Chamber. One of the highlights of a visit is an area known as Lookout Point, which offers a panoramic view of most of the caves. In addition to the natural rock formations, the caves are also home to wildlife - several North American brown bats live at the cave's lowest point which is about 155 feet below the surface. Despite the distance from ground level, visitors to Crystal Cave aren't too cold as the temperature inside the entire cave system is kept at a constant 54 degrees year round. Crystal Cave offers visitors plenty to see and do, apart from the caves themselves. The grounds also feature a scenic nature trail and an unusual miniature golf course, which features natural relics as obstacles. There is also a restaurant serving local Amish country delicacies, a well-stocked rock and mineral shop and a museum displaying promotional and advertising memorabilia. Most children also enjoy the most recent attraction at Crystal Cave, panning for gemstones."
"D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewery","Pennsylvania","D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewery - Pottsville, Pennsylvania - beer brewing company and factory tour","D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewery, which was founded in 1829, is the oldest brewery in the United States. It was started by David G. Yuengling and remains operated by the Yuengling family at its historic location in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Originally, the plant was located on Centre Street in this town, but after a fire in 1831 destroyed the building, it was moved to its current location on Mahantongo Street. Today, they also have locations in other states, such as South Carolina and Alabama, in order to keep up with growing demands for their products, led by their flagship beer Yuengling Traditional Lager. Visitors to the Pottsville area are invited to visit the D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewery's original building to participate in a facility tour. Although you need to be 21 to try any of the alcoholic product produced by this company, guests of all ages are invited on the tour. The tour, however, is not handicapped accessible, as there are several areas that have steps. In order to take the tour, visitors must be wearing close-tied shoes, as flip flops, sandals, and shoes open in the front, back, or sides could be dangerous. During the tour, visitors get to see the six-step brewing process. First, corn grits and malted barley are added to large hoppers and cooked into a mash. The mixture is then separated into liquid and solids, and the liquid is transferred into a kettle to be sterilized and mixed with hops. It then is transferred to the fermenting cellar, where yeast is added, causing the creation of beer. The beer ages for two weeks in a second cellar, after which it is cooled and filtered. The plant adjusts the carbon dioxide levels in the beer to give it proper foaming abilities, and from finishing tanks, it is tested and pumped into cans, bottles, and kegs for consumer and commercial purchase. The tour shows guests all parts of this process before ending in the gift shop. The brewery not only has a gift shop full of Yuengling and beer memorabilia and souvenirs, but they also have a bar where guests who are at least 21 years old can taste the products. The bar at the brewery is known as the Rathskeller, and it has been serving patrons since 1936. Tours leave daily to provide guests with many time options to see the D.G. Yuengling and Son Brewery. There is no charge for the tour unless you have a large group of 20 or more people. During the entire year, the brewery is open from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday through Friday, with tours leaving daily at 10:00 AM and 1:30 PM.

"Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Attracts Millions of Visitors Annually","Pennsylvania","Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area Attracts Millions of Visitors Annually","Located close to Interstate 80 near Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains and the city of East Stroudsburg, Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area is a 67,000 acre park that constitutes the largest designated recreation area in the eastern United States. The park separates Pennsylvania from New Jersey and attracts upwards of approximately 3 million visitors each year. The land around the Water Gap is rich in history though most people head there for the recreational opportunities. Nonetheless, many significant Native American archaeological sites can be found within the confines of the Delaware Water Gap area and some have already been studied by area archaeologists. Portions of the French and Indian War were fought on this land and, for decades, it was an early resort area thanks to the success of the railroads that ran through the region. All of this activity resulted in the construction of many historic buildings in the area, though many were removed when the idea for the Water Gap Recreation Area was conceived and implemented in the 1960s. Nonetheless, pieces of past settlements can be found around the park and may be visited by park guests. Many of these structures have been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. These include the Dingman's Ferry Dutch Reformed Church, a Georgian-style place of worship built in 1850; the stately Marie Zimmerman Farm, which dates back to the 1870s; and the Isaac Van Campen Inn, built in 1750 and used as a fort during the French and Indian War. Of course, the waters of the Delaware River are the main focus of this park and many visitors come here to enjoy all it has to offer. Swimming is available at lifeguarded beaches in several areas of the expansive park. Snorkeling is permitted as well and many visitors also come to the park to SCUBA dive, particularly in the Walpack Bend and Point of Gap locations.

"DelGrosso's Amusement Park","Pennsylvania","DelGrosso's Amusement Park - Tipton, PA - amusement park and tourist attraction in Central Pennsylvania's Allegheny Mountains","In the early 20th century, the Bland family created an amusement park located in Central Pennsylvania. At first, the park consisted of just a small dance floor and a picnic area, along with some attractions inspired by the Rinard Brothers carnival. George Rinard bought the park in 1928, and later, in 1946, he sold this park to Fred and Mafalda DelGrosso, who completely renovated the location and created DelGrosso's Amusement Park. Many of the rides at DelGrosso's Amusement Park have roots in the original park attractions. The antique carousel is one of the park's most popular attractions, but other rides include the Tipton Creek Railroad, dodgem bumper cars, Space Odyssey, the paratrooper ride, the Flying Bobs, a Ferris wheel, and a free fall ride. In addition to the adult and family rides at DelGrosso's Amusement Park, the park runs Kids Kingdom, and area especially for younger guests. This area is next to the Janet Weis Infant Care Center, which has changing stations, private areas for mothers who are nursing, stroller and wagon rentals, and a number of baby supplies available for a small cost. Kids Kingdom has over ten rides, including boats, helicopters, fire trucks, and a merry-go-round. This area is smoke-free. Connected to DelGrosso's Amusement Park is a water park know as Tipton Waterworks. This park has four different slides, as well as Tipton Rapids. Additionally, guests can check out the main pool of the Tipton Waterworks, which has fountains, slides, and places for children to climb and play in the water. This area also has complimentary poolside chairs for patrons who simply want to enjoy the sun. Across from Tipton Waterworks, guests can find other attractions. Championship Golf is a small miniature golf course featuring caves and mountains. There are three lakes, a bridge, and a number of waterfalls on this miniature golf course. Nearby, the park also has a Speedway, where guests can find a large go-kart track. These three areas are connected to the main park through a pedestrian crosswalk, which travels over Old Route 220. One of the features of DelGrosso's Amusement Park is the food. They have a number of items available that aren't found anywhere else, rather than just the general selection of amusement park food. Murf's Potato Salad is the main draw, and some people travel to this park especially for a fresh batch of it. They also make fresh pizza daily, as well as their own sausage and baked beans. Guests who are interested in the familiar can also find ice cream, hot dogs, and other regular park food at the many stands at the park.

"Drake Well Museum","Pennsylvania","Drake Well Museum - Titusville, PA - Birth of the Oil Industry","The Drake Well Museum is located off of Route 8, south of Titusville. It is located in Cherrytree Township on Museum Lane Road. The Drake Well Museum is dedicated to the beginnings and development of the oil industry. It takes its name from its centerpiece of interest, the Drake Well. The Drake Well was an oil well that was drilled in 1859 by Edwin L. Drake. Drake had worked for the Seneca Oil Company during the 1850s. He was sent to Titusville to locate oil based on reports that there were oil deposits in the area. He began drilling, and for some months, the drill used did not reach oil. Seneca abandoned the project, but Drake kept on. Eventually, in late summer, the drill reached oil. The Museum is supported by the Friends of Drake Well, Inc. This association maintains the Museum as well as providing educational programs. The association published a quarterly newsletter, The Barker, as well as an annual journal, The Oilfield. The former is relevant to happenings at the Museum, while the later publishes information on the oil industry. There are six types of membership available for joining the Friends of Drake Well, Inc., including two corporate memberships. The student membership is $5 and is for children 6-12 years old.

"Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort","Pennsylvania","Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort - Acme, PA - Home Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright","The Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort is located at 1 Usonian Drive in Acme, Pennsylvania. Acme is an unincorporated community that lies in both Mount Pleasant and Donegal Townships. The Duncan House was designed by the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright and was built in 1957. The Duncan House was originally located in Lisle, Illinois, and was dismantled and moved to its current location at Polymath Park. The Progress Fund, the State of Pennsylvania, and the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy were jointly responsible for moving the Duncan House. These three entities, along with Polymath Park, developed a plan to move and reconstruct the Duncan House on the property in Acme. The concept of Polymath Park was the vision of Peter Berndtson, Wright's apprentice. The Duncan House is located near two other homes in Polymath Park that were designed by Berndtson in the Usonian-style for which Frank Lloyd Wright is known. The two homes designed by Berndtson are called the Balter House and the Blum House. It took many months to relocate the Duncan House to Polymath Park and reconstruct it, but it is recognized as a particularly magnificent example of the Usonian designs used by Wright. It can be argued that the Duncan House stands as the culmination of Wright's architectural career. The Duncan House can be toured and is also available for lodging. Tours of the Duncan House are by reservation only. Reservations can be made by calling 877-833-7829. When lodging at the Duncan House, guests reserve the entire house, not simply a room.

For each additional person beyond the initial three, there is a fee of $50 per person per night. There is a minimum stay of two nights. Rental rates are subject to change at any time, and holiday rates are often higher. Because of the architectural nature of the Duncan House and its historical significance, children under six years of age are not permitted to stay in the home. The Duncan House is L-shaped and has bedroom and carport wings. Both wings meet near a large fireplace, with the living room located on one side and the dining area and kitchen located on the other side.

"Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia is a Walk through History","Pennsylvania","Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia is a Walk through History","	Often considered to be the nation's oldest intact colonial-era residential street and one of the oldest continually occupied streets in the United States, Elfreth's Alley in Philadelphia is a charming, narrow cobblestone thoroughfare that boasts row homes that were built between the early 18th and early 19th centuries. First established in 1702, the street is close to the city's prime historic district and many visitors include it on their tour itinerary of the city. It is also just steps from Betsy Ross's house. The street was formed when two local blacksmiths, John Gilbert and Arthur Wells, gave a portion of their land to create an alleyway that connected the Delaware River to their blacksmithing operations. The street later became a popular place for artisans and craftsmen to reside and most of those individuals both lived and worked in their Elfreth's Alley homes. The street was well known for its diverse population and during the Industrial Revolution it became a favored avenue for immigrants who had arrived in America to work at the many new factories in the city. But by the 20th century, the street was quite run down and slated for bulldozing in order to make room for new and faster highways. However, by the 1930s, an association of concerned citizens was formed and they would ultimately save the historic street from demolition. Now a National Historic Landmark District, Elfreth's Alley currently consists of 32 beautifully refurbished homes, most privately owned. Visitors are welcome to tour Elfreth's Alley at any time, but because the homes are indeed owned by private parties, only the exteriors can be enjoyed by those touring the area. However, the lovingly-restored homes are very attractive and redone according to the colonial architecture of the era in which they were built, making for excellent photo opportunities. Home owners are accustomed to tourist snapping pictures and most are not opposed to the practice. One home, however, has been converted to a museum and visitors can indeed go inside and browse. This home is located at Number 126 and is dubbed the Elfreth's Alley Museum. It was once owned by the alley's namesake, Jeremiah Elfreth, also a blacksmith. Inside the museum, visitors can enjoy either a self-guided or guided tour of the home and all its 18th century furnishings. Also at the museum, visitors can pick up brochures that provide information about the other homes on the block, their history, and the stories of the people who once lived in them. Since Elfreth's Alley was formed in 1702, an estimated 3,000 have lived on the street and their stories are fascinating. It's not unusual to see a Benjamin Franklin impersonator strolling down Elfreth's Alley, interacting with tourists and posing for photos. In addition, the Elfreth's Alley Association and the residents of the street occasionally host special events such as monthly First Friday programs, which highlight 300 years of arts and crafts and include architectural walks and historic tours. Visitors can also catch an occasional concert or other musical event in the alley."

"Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown, Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania","Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown, Pennsylvania","The Elmwood Park Zoo was founded in 192, and is located in Norristown, Pennsylvania. The facility began when a private landowner donated 80-acres of land and since that time the zoo has grown to include more than 300 animals that represent some 100 species. The original exhibits at the facility included monkeys, bears, raccoons, deer, peacocks and rabbits. Over the years, the zoo has expanded and changed. With advances made in animal care, the exhibits changed from stark, bare, wire cages and were transformed into more natural exhibits that gave comfort to the animals. Elmwood Park Zoo developed a focus on animals from North and South America, and the zoo was supported by the Norristown Zoological Society, though operations continued to come from the Boroughs. A group of devoted citizens oversaw programs and donated time and monetary support for the zoo. Becoming an official non-profit facility in 1985, the Norristown Zoological Society assumed control of the zoo from the Borough of Norristown. In 1987, the first long term Master Plan was developed for the expansion of the Elmwood Park Zoo and the motion was approved by the Norristown Borough Council. The Master Plan was concluded in 2002, and the zoo expanded in size from 8 to 16-acres, and constructed new animal exhibits including the Andrew L. Lewis Wetlands Aviary. The Sensorium,'' an indoor facility was renovated into the Bayou, an exhibit displaying American reptiles and amphibians such as alligators, turtles, lizards and snakes. In August of 1997, Phase I of the Grassland Exhibit, featuring American Bison and Roosevelt Elk, was opened. Completed in 1999, the Powell Pavilion, Cougar Cafy and the Lenore Weiss Nature Shop were opened. In 2001, the Thomas Kimmel Conservation Kingdom debuted as a state-of-the-art interactive playground area for children. Beginning in 2002, the second phase of the Grasslands Exhibit was opened, featuring prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets, one of the most endangered animal species in the world. Upon completion of the Grasslands Exhibit, the original Master Plan of 1987 was labeled successful. Every year, the Elmwood Park Zoo welcomes more than 130,000 visitors through the gates for an educational adventure in a clean, safe, family-oriented atmosphere.  Through constant expansion and improvements, the Zoo has retained much of its history over the years.

"Fonthill","Pennsylvania","Fonthill - Doylestown, Pennsylvania - mansion built by archaeologist Henry Chapman Mercer","Located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Fonthill is a 44 room concrete mansion build by millionaire businessman and archaeologist, Henry Chapman Mercer. Mercer began construction of the castle in 1908, when he was 51 years old, and completed construction in 1812. It was meant to be both his home and a showplace for both his own tiles and those he had collected over the years. The elaborate structure is now operated as a museum by the Bucks County Historical Society. Henry Chapman Mercer, the architect and builder of Fonthill, was one of the founding members of the Bucks County Historical Society. Born in Bucks County and educated at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, Mercer acquired a degree in law and passed the bar in Pennsylvania, but never practiced law. Instead, he followed his interest in pre-historic artifacts into a career as an archaeologist. While he participated in archaeological digs throughout the world, he developed a special fascination for pre-Industrial Age American artifacts, and especially the examples of Pennsylvania pottery that he found. He used the themes and styles from that pottery in creating architectural tiles, known as Moravian tiles, which became famous throughout the world. Fonthill and its accompanying estate consist of the concrete mansion, the Mercer Museum and the Moravian Tile Factory. Known as one of the fathers of the Arts and Crafts movements in American architecture, Mercer always intended that his home would be a showplace for his tile works, and that the Mercer Museum would be a showplace for the artifacts he had collected over the years. One of the most interesting facts about the Fonthill Estate is that, unlike so many of his wealthy contemporaries, Mercer actually participated in the building of Fonthill and its attendant buildings, working with a small group of artisans and builders. He chose to work with reinforced concrete because of its flexibility and its durability, and the Fonthill buildings stand as testament that concrete can be beautiful. Mercer occupied Fonthill until his death in 1930, at which time it was taken over by the Mercer/Fonthill Trust. In 1976, the Bucks County Historical Society took over administration of Fonthill and the Mercer Museum. Fonthill was accredited as a museum by the American Association of Museums in 1992, and achieved the status of National Historic Landmark in 1985. The Bucks County Historical Society operates and manages a number of programs at Fonthill, including scheduled tours of the estate and the tower itself, Behind the Scenes tours for adults, craft demonstrations and talks on various aspects of American folk culture and architecture. Fonthill also offers programs for youth, children and families, as well as educational programs for people of all ages. The activities at Fontill include an annual Folk Festival that features contemporary artisans and performers. Each winter, the estate offers Winter Wonderland tours of the estate decorated for the holidays and a free Holiday Open House with refreshments and entertainment. Fonthill is open daily year round with the exception of Christmas and New Years Day for guided tours only. Admissions range from $4 for students to $10 for an adult ticket, and there is special pricing available for groups. For more information about Fonthill, contact the facility at 215-348-9461."
"Franklin Court in Philadelphia Educates Visitors on the Life of Ben Franklin","Pennsylvania","Franklin Court in Philadelphia Educates Visitors on the Life of Ben Franklin","	Franklin Court is a unique Philadelphia attraction that provides guests with the opportunity to learn fun and interesting facts about early statesman Benjamin Franklin and his family. First opened in 1976 for the city's Bicentennial celebration, the site has been greatly improved throughout the last decade and is now a much more popular attraction with visitors of all ages. It is also slated to soon receive another face lift, according to an announcement by the National Park Service in January 2009. The area that is occupied by Franklin Court was once the Philadelphia home of Franklin, his wife Deborah, and their children. The home was thought to be 3 stories tall with 10 rooms. Unfortunately, it was razed in 1812 but visitors can still view pieces of the home and its interior that have been unearthed, including the foundation, wells, and privy (bathroom) pits. A number of ceramic artifacts are also on display in this part of the outdoor museum. Most children, however, enjoy visiting the unique underground museum that is a fun part of Franklin Court. This area underneath the court includes a number of objects made by Franklin, an avid inventor and entrepreneur. There's a Franklin stove, a novel swim fin, and - the most fascinating offering - Franklin's glass harmonica, for which W.A. Mozart wrote a special piece of music. National Park rangers demonstrate the harmonica periodically. The main part of the underground museum features a bank of phones and a wall full of phone numbers that give visitors access to testimonies about Franklin from some of the greatest minds and personalities of the time, including George Washington, Mozart, and author/poet D.H. Lawrence. Also in this portion of the museum is the opportunity to view an interesting 18 minute film about Franklin's life, including his time spent outside of Philadelphia. Several other buildings surround the courtyard area of Franklin Court. They are traditional-style early Colonial townhouses that have been restored to period splendor. Guests can visit 318 Market Street, where they'll be treated to an architectural exhibit about Franklin's interest in fire-resistant buildings. Also inside this building is a display of Franklin-owned pottery and glassware. Situated next door, at 320 Market Street, is the printing office and bindery. Here, rangers give printing demonstrations and guests can view old printing and binding equipment used by Franklin and his contemporaries. Another townhouse is the restored office of the Aurora and the General Advertiser, papers published by Franklin's grandson. Because Franklin was once the postmaster general, guests can also visit the U.S. Postal Museum, located in another of the renovated homes, and can stop by the Post Office and have their mail hand-stamped by a postal worker with a B. Free Franklin'' postmark. This is the only post office in the United States that does not fly a U.S. flag because there was not yet one in existence during Franklin's years as postmaster. Admission to all the attractions at Franklin Court is free and the area is rarely crowded but is full of good photo opportunities."

"Gobbler's Knob and Punxsutawney Phil, a Groundhog's Day Tradition","Pennsylvania","Gobbler's Knob and Punxsutawney Phil, a Groundhog's Day Tradition"," Many have heard that on Groundhog's Day, it can be predicted whether winter is at its end based on whether the groundhog can see his shadow after emerging from underground.  What some may not know is where this tradition started. Since 1886, the folks of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania have gathered on February 2nd to celebrate Groundhog's Day. The celebration centers around Punxsutawney Phil, a groundhog who emerges each Groundhogs day from his hole on Gobbler's Knob to let towns people know whether or not they should put away their winter clothes. The nation looks to Punxsutawney Phil as the'' Groundhog's Day groundhog. The media converges on the small town of just under 7,000 residents, which is located 90 miles northeast of Pittsburgh to cover the emergence of Phil. The event, which draws - by some estimates - approximately 30,000 tourists, is big business for the town which, until some recent economic developments, relied heavily on the coal mining industry. The town of Punxsutawney has learned to parlay their annual shot at fame into an ongoing tourist industry. Visitors from all over come to the town every day to see Punxsutawney Phil . The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club plans the events that will take place in the town each February 2nd. While the events are free, the town and the surrounding area still benefit from the influx of visitors to the area. There is much legend surrounding Punxsutawney Phil and his powers of prediction. Those who visit the website of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club will learn that there has only been one Punxsutawney Phil, and that the groundhog has been making predictions for almost 130 years.  The site also claims that Phil's predictions are correct 100% of the time . While some of the records of Phil's earliest predictions have been lost, the records are complete since 1900. That is, no doubt, due to the fact that the Groundhog Club was formed in 1899. Punxsutawney Phil's earliest predictions were made in private, but that changed in 1887 with the first trek to Gobbler's Knob. Since that time, Phil has grown in popularity and has been on major news shows, such as the Today Show and even paid a visit to the White House in 1986 to visit President Reagan. He also appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 1995. Phil has also, at times, been a bit of a political activist. During prohibition, he threatened to extend winter if he was not allowed to have a drink. During the Iranian hostage crisis in the early 80's, Phil wore a yellow ribbon to show his support. Phil's fame continues to grow. In 2001 his prediction was shown in lights in Times Square. Whether his predictions are accurate or not, Punxsutawney Phil is likely to keep growing in popularity and the residents of the town will continue reaping the benefits."

The theatre features many touring Broadway shows, classical music and dance attractions, and world-renowned entertainers. There are easy drop-off and pick up points at the front entrance, whilst free parking is conveniently located close to the Theatre entrance with free bus and van parking also available. The theatre was the brainchild of entrepreneur and philanthropist Milton S. Hershey and his plans for the Community Center Building were drawn up in 1915. The building was not completed until 1933, fours years after work started, and cost the princely sum of $3 million as part of Hershey's building campaign for the Great Depression, which provided work for 600 skilled workers. The theatre was part of the Community Center and became a major draw for leading performers and shows from around the world. The architecture of the building is designed in a very elegant style starting in the Grand Lobby with the floor made from Italian lava rock. The walls are shaped with four different types of marble and a series of arches. There are wonderful images of pastoral scenes and war chariots on the ceiling too. The inner foyer's gold arched tile ceiling design was based on St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, a city Hershey was very fond of. The blue and gold mosaic design leading to the main seating floor area took two years to complete. The main level of the auditorium carries on the theme with a winged lion mounted above the stage and the six ton fire curtain has a water color scene from Venice painted on it. The stage measures 75 feet from wall to wall, and 44 feet from the apron to the back wall. There are five elevators attached to the stage, which can rise to a maximum height of seven feet. The elevator at the back of the stage can be moved below stage level, enabling the movement of scenery to and from storage. Movies can be shown at the theatre by lowering a screen on to a steel frame on the stage. Hershey also commissioned a concert organ with over 4000 pipes, with the largest being over 30 feet tall. The entertainers are accommodated in five floors of dressing rooms. Aside from the numerous Broadway shows, concerts and other entertainment performed by world renowned artists at the theatre, there is a tour of the building provided for groups. It gives visitors and/or students a chance to look behind the scenes to see how the shows are staged. The tour also provides an insight in to the vision of the theatre's founder, its history and information on the building architecture. For those wanting to dine before a performance at the theatre there are nine restaurants at Hershey resorts with the options of gourmet dining, family meals, late night cocktails and light snacks. The Theatre offers a wide variety of space for meetings and buffet style receptions. There are four rooms that can be hired separately or combined as one for larger events."

"Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark - Altoona, Pennsylvania historical railroad track curve","Pennsylvania","Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark - Altoona, Pennsylvania historical railroad track curve","Horseshoe Curve is distinctive in that as well as being a reminder of the importance of the railroad industry in the United States; it's also located in an area of spectacular natural beauty. Horseshoe Curve is the name given to a dramatic curve in the railroad track, near Altoona in the Allegheny Mountains in Pennsylvania. The track has been in continual use for over 150 years. The stretch of railroad track was constructed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which was founded in 1846 and was the largest and busiest railroad in the US for much of the 20th century. The tracks were later owned and used by other railroad companies including Conrail and Penn Central; today it is operated by the Norfolk and Southern Railway. It was decided that the dramatic curve was necessary, as it was considered too difficult to build the railroad line through the summit of the nearby mountain, so the only other solution was to go around it. This spot has always been a strategic one; Union soldiers were ordered to guard the curve from attack during the Civil War and even the Germans tried to sabotage the curve during WWII. From the beginning, construction of Horseshoe Curve was a major feat of engineering. The location was relatively inaccessible and almost all the materials had to be transported to the site by pack animals; most of the work was carried out using gunpowder and hand tools. Two curves were built to accommodate four tracks; there is a height difference of about 120 feet between the two curves. The centenary of Horseshoe Curve in 1954 was celebrated by illuminating it with over 6,000 light bulbs and in 1967 the curve was recognized as a National Historic Landmark. In 1981, one of the curve's four tracks was removed, partly to reduce maintenance costs on the stretch of track and partly because a more efficient signaling system meant fewer tracks were needed. The dramatic curve is perhaps best appreciated from a train traveling on the tracks. In a typical day, over 50 trains use this section of track, including passenger trains and freight trains with many cars, sometimes passing simultaneously. The curve is also used by Amtrak's Pennsylvanian service, on its daily 444 mile journey between New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. However, it's also possible to appreciate the engineering ingenuity involved in the construction of Horseshoe Curve without riding the train. In 1992, a small visitor's center with a trackside observation area was built, and today this location can be reached by funicular railway. There is also a small museum operated by the Railroaders Memorial Museum and picnic area, offering a good view of the track and its setting. Horseshoe Curve National Landmark is located about five miles west of Altoona, in the Allegheny Mountains of southeast Pennsylvania. The curve is located at Kittanning Gap, a natural break in the mountains; the highest point nearby is at an altitude of about 3,000 feet."

"Houdini Museum","Pennsylvania","Houdini Museum - Scranton, Pennsylvania - magic museum featuring the history of Harry Houdini's career and life","Located in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the Houdini Museum was founded in 1988 to celebrate the life and career of famous magician Harry Houdini. During the late 1800s and early 1900s, Houdini (born Erik Weisz) was one of the most popular American magicians, and he was well known for being an escape artist and stunt performer. He was also known for attempting to expose frauds who claimed to be supernatural. During his career, Houdini performed a number of challenges in Northeastern Pennsylvania, where Scranton was a booming railroad town, and the Houdini Museum features a number of artifacts from this era in his life, as well as magic shows in the spirit of Houdini. The Houdini Museum was created by American magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brooks (aka, John Bravo). Many of the artifacts were collected by these two magicians over the years, and they include items that were passed down to Brooks by his father, who saw Houdini perform around the turn of the century. Originally, the artifacts were on display in The Magic Towne House in New York City, along with a replica of the Houdini bust that appears at the magician's grave and a very large painting of Houdini. While these items were returned to their owner, the Society of American Magicians, the rest of the collection was moved to the current location in Scranton. Today, the Houdini Tour and Magic Show lasts at least two hours and is appropriate for the entire family. The tour includes film footage from over 100 years ago of the magician doing some of his famous stunts. These films are extremely rare, so this is one of the few places you can see Houdini. After touring the museum, guests can watch the non-scary magic show, which includes tricks with live animals and audience participation. The Houdini Tour has four parts. First, guest can watch the video of Houdini performing. The two-part guided tour features the Houdini History Room, with information about his life, and a separate room with many of Houdini's props, family information, and pictures from the local Scranton challenges he performed. Guests are then ushered into the theatre, where they can see other Houdini exhibits, as well as information on how Houdini really died. After a short breaks, guests can enjoy the live magic show. Guests who want a somewhat spooky experience can visit later in the year to enjoy Haunted! Mind Mysteries & The Beyond. Tickets for this show are available by reservation only. Starting at 8 PM on Tuesdays through Sundays, this magic show lasts about three hours and includes mind reading, telekinesis, and more. Guests can attend a syance in the museum, which is one of the older buildings in Scranton, as well as learn about the murder/suicide that took place in the building around the time Houdini was performing. Tickets for this even cost $35. General admission for the Houdini Museum is just $14.95, with special prices during the summer. They're open year-round, with daily afternoon hours during July and August. Call 570-341-5555 to learn more."

"Idlewild and SoakZone","Pennsylvania","Idlewild and SoakZone - Ligonier, Pennsylvania - water park and entertainment center","In 1878, landowner William Darlington gave a piece of property to Judge Thomas Melon and the Ligonier Valley Railroad to create a picnic area and entertainment center. At first, the newly-formed Idlewild Park was a commercial failure, but as they started adding more amusement rides and a new family took over running the park, it became a success. Today, the original picnic grove and entertainment center has turned into a widely known amusement park and water park called Idlewild and SoakZone. The park today has seven themed areas. One of the most popular is Olde Idlewild, and includes two roller coasters and a dozen other amusement park rides. This area of the park has some of the oldest rides in the park, such as the Merry-Go-Round, which is the centerpiece of the entire park. This carousel was built in the 1920s and has been at the park since 1931. Other rides in this area include a Ferris wheel, a caterpillar type of miniature roller coaster, a paratrooper ride, a whip, and a tilt-a-whirl. This area of the park also has games, food, and other attractions that are themed around the old-time park. Many visitors go to Idlewild and SoakZone especially for the water park area. The SoakZone features a number of slides, an interactive kid's area called Captain Kidd's Adventure Galley, a large swimming pool, and a number of other water rides and attractions.

"Johnstown Flood Museum","Pennsylvania","Johnstown Flood Museum - Johnstown, Pennsylvania - museum commemorating the 1889 Johnstown flood tragedy","In 1889, a huge storm led to a flood in the Johnstown area. This was not an unusual occurrence in the spring in this city, but this storm turned into a large tragedy when a neglected dam above the city burst, and millions of gallons of water came rushing into the city carrying tons of debris. Many of the residents of Johnstown had decided to ride out the storm, and typically they would have been safe marooned on the top stories of their homes as water seeped into their basements and first floors. However, the rush of water from the dam acted like a tsunami, and over 2,200 people died in the disaster. The Johnstown Flood Museum honors the victims of this tragedy and the people who helped to rebuild the destroyed town over the next few years. There are a number of exhibits to explore after learning the story of the flood as visitors come into the museum. Guests can see the multimedia map relief map, which shoes the path of the water from the point where the rain started to the moment when the dam burst, and beyond, to the time period when the dam waters began to subside from the flooded Conemaugh Valley. The dam was owned by the South Fork Fishing & Hunting Club, who neglected to repair and maintain the dam, even though they enjoyed the reservoir and surrounding area. So, an important part of the museum is the exhibit that showcases this outdoor club. In addition, there are a number of artifacts recovered from the flood, including a bottle of the actual floodwater and items related to the recovery process, including a morgue book, mementos left for victims, and Red Cross supply kits. The museum also has clippings from newspapers that covered the disaster, which have a number of Victorian stereographic photographs. One of the most interesting parts of the museum is the replica Oklahoma House. This exhibit was created in 2000 to show the temporary houses were built following the flood to house refugees. These homes were originally constructed as quick housing options for those moving to the Oklahoma Territory, but worked well as housing until new homes could be built. Unfortunately, many families in this area could not afford to build new houses very quickly, since the flood was determined an act of God'' and lawsuits against the outdoor club were dismissed. The Oklahoma Houses were not meant to withstand harsh Pennsylvania winters, so many families suffered in the years following the flood. A ticket to the Johnstown Flood Museum also gives visitors admission to the Frank & Sylvia Pasquerilla Heritage Discovery Center, which is home to the Johnstown Children's Museum and the Iron & Steel Gallery, as well as the Wagner-Ritter House & Garden. Admission costs $7 for adults, $6 for seniors, and $5 for child aged 3 through 18. Tickets are good for five days, so travelers who are visiting the area can enjoy all of the attractions in the area without trying to hurry through the network of locations.

"Johnstown Inclined Plane","Pennsylvania","Johnstown Inclined Plane - Johnstown, Pennsylvania - the world's steepest vehicular inclined plane","Built in 1890 after the historical Johnstown Flood, the Johnstown Inclined Plane is a vehicular inclined plane that carries people and items to and from the valley area. This is the steepest vehicular inclined plane in the world, with 30-foot cars that can carry up to 65 people at one time. The cars are also large enough to care up to 6 motorcycles or even a vehicle. Around 100,000 passengers travel up or down the inclined plane every year, and at one time, when the town was running a number of large steel mills, the inclined plane carried up to one million passengers per year. After the 1889 Johnstown Flood, the area received a lot of attention statewide and even nationally. However, not much was done to prevent future problems with flooding in the area. The inclined plane saved a number of lives in 1936, when another spring flood ravaged the town. Nearly 4000 people were carried to safety from the flooded valley via the inclined plane. In 1977, the valley again flooded, and along with carrying residents to higher ground, the inclined plane helped to carry rescue workers, boats, emergency equipment, and other needed items down to the valley to help save people and repair the damages. It was only later, after this third flood, that this area began to get the attention it needed to create a safer environment from future floods, but the inclined plane is still a much-needed service for people who live in or travel to Johnstown. In addition to providing transportation between the two areas, the Johnstown Inclined Plane has become a tourist destination, with many people coming to the attraction just to take the round trip on one of the cars. They hold a number of events every year, including Christmas pictures with Santa at the top of the inclined plane and Pick Passes for fans who want to travel on the inclined plane during the fall and winter to see the Johnstown Cheifs games. The inclined plane takes visitors to an elevation of 1,693.5 feet, and the track itself is nearly 900 feet long. When visitor ride the inclined plane, they're traveling at a 35 degree angle on cars that weigh 38 tons each. The inclined plane is lit by over 100 high-pressure sodium lamps and a ride one-way lasts 25 minutes. The Johnstown Inclined Plane's two cars balance one another on the cables, so this lift doesn't take much power to run. Samuel Diescher of Pittsburgh designed this machine; he is more famous for designing the machinery that operated the first Ferris Wheel, which premiered at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. For those who live in the Johnstown area and intend to ride on the inclined plane often, the best value is to purchase a commuter pass, which costs $10 for 10 rides or $20 for 22 rides (all rides are one-way). For just a single ride, tickets cost $4 for a round-trop or $2.25 for a one-way trip for adults and $2.50 for a round trip and $1.50 for a round trip for children under thirteen. Seniors ride for free, and there are special prices for groups of 20 or more. Guests can also pay to transport their vehicle using the inclined plane for $6.00. Motorcycle transportation costs $4."
"Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery","Pennsylvania","Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery - Lititz, Pennsylvania - first commercial pretzel bakery in the United States","Founded in 1861, the Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery was the first commercial pretzel bakery to operate in the United Sates. Originally, founder Julius Sturgis baked bread in his factory, and legend has it that a hobo passing through town gave him a pretzel recipe in exchange for a meal. Sturgis discovered that the recipe worked well, and added it to the business. After about a decade, the pretzels were so popular that he stopped making bread altogether to focus primarily on selling pretzels. Today, the company still uses this recipe and the old techniques originally used by the company's founder. The bakery's building is on the National Register of Historic Places and was one of the original buildings in the city. It has a pegged floor, a musket that was once used to protect the home from Native Americans, wooden doors with iron hinges, and a carved panel staircase.

"Kennywood","Pennsylvania","Kennywood - West Mifflin, Pennsylvania - traditional amusement park and historical landmark in western Pennsylvania","Kennywood opened in 1898 as a trolley park in western Pennsylvania. It was started by the Monongahela Street Railway Company, just like many small parks were started by railroads during this time period to encourage tourists to ride the rails. In 1902, they leased the park to an amusement company to create stronger competition against other trolley parks in the area. Today, Kennywood covers over 100 acres and has 32 rides, including five roller coasters. In 2004, they were voted second in Theme Park Magazine's Reader's Choice Award.

Wright had a number of other projects also in the works at the time, but insisted on taking the project, which he felt he could design easily and quickly. It became one of the last private homes he built before his death in 1959. Kentuck Knob is located on Chestnut Ridge in the Allegheny Mountains. It overlooks the Youghiogheny River Gorge and surrounding farmland, and it is about four miles from the famous Fallingwater. At the time, Kentuck Knob cost $96,000 to build, and is constructed mainly of red cypress, glass, and sandstone. Like many Usonian homes, this house blends well with the natural environment. It's half-moon shape curves around a courtyard , with stone planters that make up a retaining wall on the west and thick stone ramparts on the south. The Hagan family gave Wright full creative control for this project, and he chose a more challenging design and location than the obvious structural point on top of the knob. Visitors will notice that this one-story house has a lot of natural light, which was by design, though Wright only visited the site once during construction. The Palumbo family opened this house to the public in 1996. Along with the original structure, guests can tour the sculpture meadow, which was added by the family. This is located near the bottom of the mountainous property and features 35 different pieces, including works by Ray Smith, Sit Anthony Caro, Claes Oldenburg, and Andy Goldsworthy. Also included in this whimsical garden are a traditional red English telephone box and a large piece of the Berlin Wall. To tour the Kentuck Knob home, visitors must have reservations. These reservations are taken by the Fallingwater's Visitor Center and can be made for any day of the year, except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. The last tour leaves daily at 4:00 PM, and the grounds close at 5:00 PM, so anyone wishing to see the sculpture garden as well should make plans to be at the house by at least 3:00 PM. They also close early during many of the winter months and are shut down for repairs and renovations during the month of February, so it is important to call ahead for information. Regular tours of the facility last about 45 minutes, while in-depth tours last 75 minutes. They also have sunset tours given by senior staff members who show private parts of the home, Sunday brunch tours, which includes a meal in the private art room, and private tours for those who want a more personal experience. Tour rates for regular tours are $16 for adults and $10 for children, with special tours costing between $55 and $150. Children under the age of 6 are not permitted on tours, for the convenience of all guests. For more information, call visitor services at 724-329-8501."

"Kinzua Bridge PA; the Bridge to Nowhere","Pennsylvania","Kinzua Bridge PA; the Bridge to Nowhere","What's left of the Kinzua Bridge is located in Mckean County PA. The once mighty steel structure that had allowed railroad passengers and freight through Northwestern Pennsylvania was brought down by a tornado that touched down in Kinzua National Park. The massive structure was once 301 feet tall and 2052 long, making it the fourth highest railway bridge in the country. The bridge was the brainchild of Civil War hero General Thomas Kane who was a stakeholder New York Lake Erie, and Western Railroad. He wanted trains to be able to take a direct route across the valley rather than go on an eight mile detour around it. The bridge was built for a cost of $167,000 dollars and took less than four months to complete. The Kinzua Bridge was billed as the Eight Wonder of the World and trains from all over the Northeast traveled to it simply to take passengers over the bridge. There were signs from the beginning that the bridge may have some difficulties however. High winds could impact the bridge even more than engineers originally believed. There was a strict five mile per hour limit placed on trains while crossing to lessen the impact on the supports. By 1959 the only trains going over the bridge were sightseeing trains. In 1960 Governor William Scranton bought the acreage surrounding the bridge and created Kinzua National Park. For the next forty-two years sightseeing trains crossed the bridge with regularity. Then in 2002 a bridge inspection revealed the bridge was no longer structurally sound and all traffic, including pedestrian was prohibited from that day on. In early 2003 work was begun to stabilize the Kinzua Bridge. Then on July 21, 2003 a tornado touched down in Kinzua National Park. The already unstable bridge could not take the up to 100 mile winds and it failed. A later study showed that eleven of the twenty towers that supported the bridge failed. The Bridge now lies in ruins amidst the 327 acre Pennsylvania State Park. There are no definitive plans on what to do with the bridge next. If you are captivated by the beauty of Northwestern Pennsylvania and decide to relocate then the following information should be helpful. The people who live near Kinzua State Park in PA earn a median income of $45,200 dollars per year and have paid a median price of $244,000 for their homes."

Paid public parking is available at the Hager Parking Lot on King Street, the Central Market Parking Lot on Prince Street, or the Prince Street Garage on Prince Street. The heart of the museum's permanent exhibition is the late 19th-20th century Amish quilts, which was the brainchild of Doug Tompkins. He started collecting the quilts in the 1970s and sold them to the Heritage Center in 2002, which paved the way for the Quilt and Textile Museum to be opened two years later. It is housed in a building built in 1912 and once owned by the Lancaster Trust Company, but has been unoccupied for much of its life. The quilts were produced by Amish women between the 1870s and 1940s in Lancaster County. Visitors can learn about the history of this religious sect, what makes their quilts unique and how they were made. As well as this permanent collection of quilts there are collections of hooked rugs, and the museum displays other exhibits on a temporary basis throughout the year. There are several Amish communities in the United States with the largest populations in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Indiana, but due to large population growth, new settlements are continually being formed. Lancaster County is home to the world's second largest Amish settlement, where the community maintains the traditional methods and values of their ancestors. Their way of life is less materialistic so visitors can see how they maintained the skills for making quilts and rugs since they immigrated to the United States in the early 18th century. Education programs are supplied by the museum with free lectures provided on site for school groups, as well as programs giving history lessons relevant to Lancaster and printing techniques from the early 20th century. Adults and families can observe demonstrations on quilt making.

"Laurel Caverns","Pennsylvania","Laurel Caverns - Farmington, Pennsylvania - geological park and cave system in Western Pennsylvania","Located about 50 miles south of Pittsburgh, Laurel Caverns is a 435-acre geological park that showcases the largest cave system in the state of Pennsylvania. Laurel Caverns is a great tourist location for families, as they have a one-hour guided tour of some of the more accessible parts of the cave, while there are also spelunking options for adults more interested in an advanced cave experience. There is also a gift shop and scenic outlooks to take in the view of the wooded area surrounding the caves. The family tour is by far the most popular part of Laurel Caverns. Tour guides lead groups into the cave every 20 minutes during operating hours, so guests never have to wait long to start exploring. Visitors don't have to make reservations, but can schedule larger tours for groups such as scouting troops or school classes. The cave is naturally sloped along the mountains, so guests with physical challenges may not be able to take the tour. Once down into Laurel Caverns, the temperature drops or raises to 52 degrees, no matter how warm or cold it is on the surface, and the walkway will likely be wet in some places, so the proper footwear and a jacket are important. Currently, the spelunking programs at Laurel Caverns are suspended due to the dangers to the natural bat population, but they hope to reopen these features again soon. The lower caverns track shows visitors about two miles of the caves and lasts about three hours. This track is best for those over the age of 18, with children aged 12 - 17 allowed only under supervision of their parent or legal guardian. A less strenuous spelunking tour can be found with the upper caverns track, which takes visits through a number of passages showing two of the largest rooms in the developed area of the cave. This tour is available for those aged nine and older, and those under the age of 18 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. One of the most popular activities at Laurel Caverns is Kavernputt. This is an 18-hole miniature golf course that is located inside a 10,000-square-foot simulated cave. This experience is both fun and education and costs just $5 per person or $4 per person for a group of 15 or more people. For those who want a more thrilling activity, the location offers rappelling into one part of the cave every summer. This feature is available for $29 at either 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM every day, and this price includes the one-hour guided family tour. Laurel Caverns is open seven days per week from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM from May through October. They're also open during April and November (through Thanksgiving) on weekends during those same hours.

"Lehigh Valley Zoo","Pennsylvania","Lehigh Valley Zoo - Schnecksville, Pennsylvania - game preserve and zoo located in the Lehigh Valley for over a century","In 1906, local businessman General Harry C. Trexler wanted a patch of land to help preserve the North American Bison, which were facing extinction. With the help of Dr. William T. Hornaday of the Bronx Zoo, Trexler created a space where both bison and elk (wapiti) native to the area could thrive. Although Trexler died in an automobile accident in 1933, his work laid the foundation for what would become the Lehigh Valley Zoo. Originally, the game preserve was only open on Sundays and was a 1200-acre home to bison, wapiti, and deer. In the mid-1970s, the board decided to begin developing a children's zoo to go along with the preserve, and over the next several years, the collection grew to house animals both native to Pennsylvania and from around the world. Some of the animals that call the Lehigh Valley Zoo home include owls, kangaroos, otters, emus, goats, camels, prairie dogs, wolves, and llamas. Of course, visitors can still see bison, wapiti, and deer - the animals that started it all - at the zoo. They also have a birds of prey exhibit, and education zone, outdoor dining areas, and an amphitheater. The primary focus of the Lehigh Valley Zoo is education. They cater to educational groups like school classes, and provide zoo activity packs for programs while children are visiting. The programs are designed for each grade, last up to an hour, and are made to meet Pennsylvania's Assessment Anchors and Eligible Content Standards in Science. In addition, they have a sleepover program where groups can spend the night at the zoo and see how the animals act in the evening and at night. This is the most active time for some of the animals in the zoo, such as the owls and some of the mammals. The zoo also has a community educational outreach program for groups that can't make the trip to the facility. The zookeepers will bring some of the animals to the classroom, along with educational material. They also have teacher workshops, can assist in scouting events and earning badges, and provide smaller education programs for families on a daily basis, available with pre-registration. At times, the Lehigh Valley Zoo offers trips to other zoos, aquariums, parks, and preserves across the country and even around the world to help community members learn more about animals, plants, and conservation. The Lehigh Valley Zoo is open seven days a week during the entire year, weather permitting. They have in-season hours from April 1 to October 31, with admission price ranging from $6.50 to $9.00 and special group rates available to groups of 15 or more.

The zoo is closed on major holidays and during some days when there's poor weather. Visitors can call 610-799-4171 to verify that the zoo is open and learn more about the facility."

"Lititz Springs Park","Pennsylvania","Lititz Springs Park - Lititz, Pennsylvania - private park with a number of holiday celebrations","The Lititz Springs Park, which is located in Lititz, Pennsylvania, is a private park that can be used year-round by the public. It is maintained by the Churches of Lititz and owned by the Lititz Moravian Congregation, and it plays home to a number of holiday celebrations every year. This park is over 200 years old. Originally, the Lititz Springs Park wasn't open to the public, but over time, maintaining the park became a financial strain on the church. In 1956, the church's board released the park to the community, so it is today run by a board of trustees, made up of representatives from a number of community churches. They receive no public funding from the state or local governments, so they depend entirely on donations and volunteer help to keep the park running. Every year, they hold an antique show and Fourth of July celebration to help raise money for the park, and the park can be rented out for a small fee, which goes toward maintenance. The Lititz Springs Park is seven acres with a small creek running through it. Lititz Memorial Square is also part of this park. The park has a memorial fountain at its main entrance, which was donated by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Ladies Auxiliary in 1994, and a playground, which was expanded and renovated in 1992 to include an accessible children's area, places for older children, beach volleyball court, and fitness course. One of the biggest events at the Lititz Springs Park every year is the Fourth of July celebration. Some of the events and features of this celebration include live music on the main stage, a beauty queen pageant, family games with prizes, a candle illumination ceremony, and fireworks that are synchronized to music. There's also a Fourth of July parade through the city that ends at the park, as well as a baby parade and a ceremonial bell ringing. Every year, the park also holds its fall antique show as a fundraiser, and they have sponsored movie nights and even vesper services in the park during the summer. In October, there's an annual Chocolate Walk, and throughout the year, other events, such as art shows, craft shows, motorcycle rides, flea markets, and egg hunts, are held in the park.

Du Pont, a member of the wealthy Delaware-based Du Pont Chemical family. Du Pont, who had a penchant for gardening, purchased the land for the garden in 1906, and over several decades, turned the former arboretum into a 1,050 acre horticultural wonder showcasing more than 11,000 types of plants. Du Pont's world travels greatly influenced his plans for Longwood Gardens. His love for fountains, such as the ones he viewed at the World Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893, would prompt him to include numerous illuminated fountains in his designs. Today, Longwood Gardens has more than 400 water features. In addition, historians note that Du Pont was greatly influenced by the gardens he viewed throughout Europe, South America, the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Florida, enticing him to include flora from these locales in his plans. More than one hundred years after its beginnings, Longwood Gardens is now home to 20 indoor and 20 outdoor gardens boasting plants, flowers, and trees from around the world. The indoor gardens are housed in Longwood's expansive Conservatory, where visitors can view approximately 5,500 types of plants inside the structure, which covers 4.5 acres and was added in 1919. During the December holidays, the Conservatory is ablaze with thousands of poinsettias and hundreds of sparkling white lights. Orchids grace the Conservatory from January through March. The outdoor gardens, which extend over 325 acres, are abloom with flowers and plants throughout the year according to season, from azaleas and marigolds in the spring to summer roses to colorful trees and gourds in the fall. About a mile of walkways wind through the blooms and past Du Pont's treasured fountains, which are showcased during the three-week summertime Festival of Fountains.

It is said that Marie Antoinette planned to settle in Towanda. Towanda began as a lumber town, and several of the town's buildings from the 1800s still stand and can be viewed. Many of these buildings are also listed on the National Register of Historic Buildings. It is believed that members of the French aristocracy bought land that was across the river from the lookout and built a house there for Marie Antoinette and the Dauphin. The architecture and detail of the house believed to be built for them can be seen from this area. There is a historical marker that details the story of the French settlement. The marker was dedicated on June 24, 1930, and is located five miles north of Wyalusing. The marker reads as follows: A settlement of French royalists, who fled the French Revolution in 1793, was established in the valley directly opposite this marker. It was laid out and settled under the direction of Viscount de Noailles and Marquis Antoine Omer Talon. It was hoped that Queen Marie Antoinette might here find safety. Among many distinguished visitors to this place were Louise Philippe, Duke of Orleans, later King of France, Prince de Talleyrand, Duke de Montpensier and the Duke de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt. Marked by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission and the Bradford County Historical Society, 1930. While intended to be a place of escape for Marie Antoinette, the area now offers visitors a scenic view of the surrounding farmland. While the Marie Antoinette Lookout is not well-maintained, it does provide an excellent panoramic view. The view of the mountains and the Susquehanna River provide visitors with excellent opportunities for taking photographs. The pull off for Marie Antoinette's Lookout is not well-marked, but it is directly off of US Route 6. There is a yellow sign advertising beverages and food right by the turn that visitors would need to make in order to reach the lookout. Those visiting the Marie Antoinette Lookout can learn about the French settlement, fish in Stephen Foster Lake, or visit Knapp's Covered Bridge. Knapp's Covered Bridge may actually be the highest covered bridge in Pennsylvania. After visiting the lookout, visitors who want to learn more about the French settlement can visit the French Azilum's Laporte House or the French Azilum Historic Site, both of which are no more than .02 miles from the lookout. The Bradford County Historical Society & Museum is located roughly one-quarter of a mile away and would provide additional information on the area and its history as well."

"Mill Grove Mansion","Pennsylvania","Mill Grove Mansion - Audubon, PA - Home of John James Audubon","Located at 1201 Pawlings Road in Audubon, Pennsylvania, the Mill Grove Mansion was originally built in 1762. It later became the home of John James Audubon, the noted naturalist, artist, and author. Mill Grove Mansion is where John James Audubon first began studying the American birds and wildlife that he later portrayed in his realistic paintings. Owned and operated by the County of Montgomery, Mill Grove is a National Historic Landmark. Mill Grove Mansion was purchased by John James Audubon's father in 1789. He later sent his son to supervise the property, as there was a lead mine on the site. While the lead mine eventually failed, Audubon enjoyed the area, and it was the inspiration for several of his paintings. The grounds at Mill Grove Mansion consist of 175 acres and include the mansion, a large barn, and several miles of trails. The mansion sits on a slope that overlooks Perkiomen Creek. Nesting boxes, feeding stations, and a variety of plants and shrubs attract over 175 bird species to the area. With more than 400 species of flowering plants identified on the grounds, the natural beauty of the area is one of the main attractions. Mill Grove Mansion now serves as a museum and wildlife sanctuary. Inside the mansion, there are several displays.

Romito hosted several events on the grounds that became so popular that the Mansion and grounds were included on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

"Mount Washington","Pennsylvania","Mount Washington","Along the banks of the Monongahela River on the south end of Pittsburgh, PA, sits Mount Washington, a steep hill and neighborhood that overlooks the skyline of downtown Pittsburgh. The view from Mount Washington was rated the second most beautiful view in America by USA Weekend.  The hill used to be called Coal Hill, because mines operated at this location. Tunnels at the base of the hill that were utilized by the mining establishments can still be seen today. Stone was also quarried from the hill at one time. The stone for the second Allegheny County Courthouse came from this hill. The hill was renamed Mount Washington in 1876, which is about the time the first drawing of Pittsburgh was crafted from this hill. Since then, most of the photographs of the Pittsburgh skyline come from this perspective. There are also tunnels through Mount Washington that were used by the miners. Mount Washington has a line of upscale restaurants that are located around the area. It is also the home of one of the leading publishers in the country Autumn House Press.

"New Hope & Ivyland Railroad","Pennsylvania","New Hope & Ivyland Railroad - New Hope, Pennsylvania - steam train ride tourist attraction and business in Bucks County, Pennsylvania","In 1962, a group of railroad lovers in Philadelphia founded Steam Trains, Inc. A few short years later, they purchased nearly 17 miles of the Reading Company's tracks in New Hope to create the New Hope & Ivyland Railroad. They used steam for a passenger service and freight service between New Hope and Buckingham Valley until 1971, when the company purchased a diesel engine. Since then, the company was sold a number of times, and in the 1990s, the new owners, the Bucks County Railroad Preservations & Restoration Corporation, have put $2 million into completely restoring the train and tracks to its turn-of-the-century roots. The New Hope & Ivyland Railroad has a number of restored cars for guests, including 1920s passenger cars, an antique bar car, and two historic engines - a steam locomotive and a diesel locomotive. There are two train stations, one at New Hope and one at Lahaska, and passengers can get on and off at both stations and ride the train back to their originating destination. The New Hope train station is the original location that was once the site of the railroad telegraph for the New Hope area. This building is over 100 years old. An important part of the New Hope & Ivyland Railroad is its freight service. Although most visitors come to this railroad to take the historic train from New Hope to Lahaska and back, this is still a working railroad that provides transportation of raw materials and manufactured products. The largest customer for the New Hope & Ivyland Railroad is CRC Industries, a local manufacturer of auto repair chemicals. This railroad connects with CSX transportation to provide services throughout the United States, especially on the East Coast. For guests interested in historic passenger rides, the train leaves hourly at both stations. There are also special events throughout the year for those who want an even more unique experience. The New Hope & Ivyland Railroad has brought back an old tradition of serving a meal while traveling, which guests can experience in one of the Evening Star Dinner Trains. This ticket includes the round-trip ride, which lasts about two hours, and a three-course meal with a salad, entrye, and dessert. Throughout the year, there are also murder mystery dinners aboard the train, and along with diner and the round-trip ride, guests will experience an interactive theatre production. During the holiday season, visitors can also book a ticket for the North Pole Express, which features Santa, Mrs. Claus, and a number of other holiday travelers to entertain riders of all ages. This Christmas ride includes a holiday story, as well as free cocoa and cookies.

"No. 9 Coal Mine & Museum","Pennsylvania","No. 9 Coal Mine & Museum - Lansford, PA - Anthracite Coal Mine","The No. 9 Coal Mine & Museum is located in Lansford, PA, below the Pocono Mountains. Lansford is located in the western part of Carbon County. The Mine & Museum are located near the banks of Panther Creek on 9 Dock Street, near the junction of Dock and West Ridge Streets. Lansford is part of Lehigh Valley, which is an area in Pennsylvania named after the Lehigh River. This area is sometimes known as the coal region,'' particularly Carbon County. The No. 9 Coal mine was opened in 1855, but its origin traces back ten years earlier. A large anthracite coal deposit called Mammoth Vein was the focus for most mining in the Lehigh Valley. Major mine systems in the Summit Hill area produced a great deal of coal from the Vein. Unfortunately, the quarry had to be abandoned due to flooding. Mining companies decided to attempt another drilling into Mammoth Vein. Between the years of 1853 and 1856, these attempts met with many difficulties, including cost. Finally, in December of 1857, the No. 9 coal mine had been driven far enough to encounter coal. The next month, the mine was contracted to produce 90,000 tons of coal per year. Anthracite coal is a variety of coal known by its sheen. It has fewer impurities than all other types of coal, which means it has the highest carbon content. During the time of No. 9's operation, anthracite coal was the most popular fuel for heating structures in the North and East of the US. The Mine was operated until 1972. At that time, it was the world's longest running anthracite coal mine. In 2002, the Mine was re-opened as a tourist attraction. The Mine was opened by a non-profit organization by the name of Panther Creek Valley Foundation. Their mission is to preserve the landmark as a heritage site. Visitors to the mine ride 1,600 feet along rail into the mountain. They can examine the miner's hospital, the mule-way, and the original 900 foot elevator shaft. Also on the grounds is the Wash Shanty,'' which includes the tools and paraphernalia that the miner's used to wash their clothes and equipment. The Museum has items such as the tools, food cans, blasting equipment, and more that belonged to the miners of No. 9. Exhibits in the Museum also include carved pieces of coal, historical photographs, paintings, models, a replica of a miner's kitchen, and other artifacts. The gift shop sells items such as books, carved coal memorabilia, t-shirts, and miner's hats. The site also has picnic facilities and restrooms. Parking is free. The Museum and gift shop are open year round, Wednesday through Sunday, noon-4pm. The Mine is open for guided tours from May to Labor Day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. From Labor Day through October tours are only on Saturday and Sunday. Mine tours start at 11:00am and run hourly until 3:15. Temperature within the mines averages the mid-50s. The temperature in Lansford is, on average, warmest in July, at 71 degrees. Visitors entering the mine may will to wear a light jacket or sweater due to the chill in the mines. Admission to the Mine and Museum is $7. To visit the Museum only is $3. For more information, interested parties can call 570-645-7074."

"Old Jail Museum","Pennsylvania","Old Jail Museum - Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania - historic museum created out of an old jail","Located in Jim Thorpe, PA, the Old Jail Museum is a two story stone building that actually served as the Carbon County Prison from 1871 through 1995, when it was bought by the current owners, Tom and Betty Lou McBride of Jim Thorpe. The Old Jail is one of the stops on the Ghost Walks that are conducted by the Jim Thorpe Rotary Club on weekends from September through December. Built in 1871 to serve as the county jail in the town that was then known as Mauch Chunk, the Old Jail's main claim to fame in the haunted city is that it housed the infamous Molly Maguires during their trial, and was the site of their execution for murder in 1877 and 1878. The Molly Maguires are now considered to be one of the earliest labor movements, organized in support of Irish-American coal miners. The Old Jail Museum is located in the heart of Pennsylvania's anthracite coal mining country. In the years following the Civil War, Pennsylvania coal miners were subjected to exploitative conditions by the management of the coal companies, living in company housing, purchasing their own mining equipment and forced to work long hours in brutal conditions. It is believed that the Molly Maguires were a secret organization of Irish Catholic coal miners who took secret action against the exploitative conditions. On the morning of June 21, 1877, Alexander Campbell, Edward Kelly, Michael Doyle and John Donohue were hanged on the gallows constructed in the cell block. One of the men, believed to have been Alexander Campbell, put his hand on the floor of his cell, then planted it on the wall of his cell, leaving a black handprint. This handprint,'' he proclaimed, will remain here as proof of my innocence.'' The handprint has remained on that wall, despite attempts by jailers to wash it, paint over it, plaster over it and even construct a new wall, and it is part of the tour of the jail today. The building is a two story stone building that resembles a European fortress. It contains 72 rooms, most of them used as cells for prisoners. There is a women's ward, as well as a bank of tiny, cramped cells in the basement that were used as solitary confinement. In addition, the building houses the spacious and luxurious - by comparison - warden's apartment, consisting of a living room, dining room, two bedrooms and a sitting room. There is one kitchen for the entire facility, shared by the warden's family and the prisoners. In fact, for most of its existence, the warden's wife cooked the meals for prisoners in residence along with the family meals. The Old Jail Museum is open to the public for tours on weekdays from Memorial Day through Labor Day, except for Wednesdays. It is also open for tours on weekends in September and October. The facility opens at noon, and the last tour begins at 4:30 PM each day. Admission is $5 for adults, $4 for students and seniors and $3 for children ages 6-12. The tour is about an hour long, and includes ghost stories and a history of the museum. For more information about the Old Jail House Museum in Jim Thorpe, PA, contact the museum at 570-325-5259."
"Olde Stonewall Golf Club","Pennsylvania","Olde Stonewall Golf Club, Ellwood City, Pennsylvania - A Tourist-Like Attraction and One of the Top Golf Courses in the Country","For new players who see the soaring castle, knights in armor and moats at Olde Stonewall Golf Club, they might readily conclude they'd found a Disney tourist attraction, rather than a top-flight golf course. Thanks to the design work of Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry, however, Old Stonewall is considered a great golf course, from its Bent grass tee boxes and fairways, to its fast, Bent grass greens. The course, which opened in 1999, is relatively isolated and is very much like a walk through the rural low-country of Pennsylvania, especially on the front nine. The back nine, however, features significant elevation changes that take the routing even higher than the top of the castle-style clubhouse. Holes No. 11-16, in particular, provide some great views of surrounding Lawrence Country, and some dramatic uphill and downhill shots. The 18-hole, par-70 layout plays to 7,052 yards from the longest Epic'' tees and features a good deal of movement throughout the layout. The green complexes, in particular, offer a lot of movement in the form of hollows, swales, and deep, grass-topped bunkers. The greens are also well-contoured and fast, and often slope away to collection areas, as well as bunkers and water hazards, making short-game play a highly valued commodity on this course. Another striking feature of the course is its use of rocks and boulders - 600 million pounds of them, give or take - which were transported from the nearby quarry and positioned throughout the layout. The course also features a good variety in its holes, with downhill tee shots, uphill approach shots, reachable par-5s, some daunting par-3s, as well as a mixture of long par-4s and drivable ones. In keeping with the castle motif, players will also encounter a castle snack bar at the turn, a castle-style maintenance building, a knight in shining armor, bronze animal statues scattered along the rolling, wooded track, a moat, and 12-foot-tall doors that weigh 800 pounds each. Since its opening, Olde Stonewall has received its share of acclaim. At one time, GOLF Magazine had the course ranked among the Top 10 Public Golf Courses in the U.S., and Golf Digest has it ranked among the Top 50 Public Golf Courses in the country. As mentioned the course features a clubhouse that is a soaring castle, which is home to a Golf Shoppe and Shakespeare's Restaurant."

"Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue is Classic but Chic","Pennsylvania","Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue is Classic but Chic","	Originally the Bellevue Stratford Hotel, the Park Hyatt Philadelphia at the Bellevue is a luxury hotel located in a 1904-built structure that has long been a Philadelphia landmark. During its heyday, the hotel was described as the most luxurious in the nation, with Tiffany and Lalique glass and a grand marble and hand-worked iron staircase gracing the lobby area. The Bellevue Stratford earned national attention in 1976 as the breeding ground for Legionnaires Disease when 34 American Legion members died and 221 were sickened during a convention at the hotel, all struck with pneumonia-like symptoms. The episode ruined the hotel and its reputation and it closed six months later. The bacteria responsible for the disease was later found in the cooling water of the hotel's air-conditioning system, which had spread throughout the hotel via the air ducts. After reopening in 1979, the hotel changed hands several times until it became part of the Park Hyatt chain of Hyatt boutique hotels in 1996. Today, the hotel that once boasted 1,019 rooms now includes just 172 guest rooms including 12 suites.

"Philadelphia International Airport - Philadelphia PA Philadelphia Airport Flights","Pennsylvania","Philadelphia International Airport - Philadelphia PA Philadelphia Airport Flights","The Philadelphia International Airport sits in the Delaware Valley, and in 2008 managed to become the 10th busiest airport in the world. The airport runs very close to its projected maximum capacity, with more than 32 million passengers passing through annually. The airport generates more than $14 billion in revenue for the city as well. Feasibility studies are underway for an expansion of the airport, or at the very least an extension of the runways. Currently, the airport is not 100% equipped to handle the new class of super-jumbo jets that will be the preference of many international carriers. As Philadelphia is the hub city for US Airways internationally, this is a major issue. Construction is underway, but it is not keeping up with the rate of expansion and the economic collapse of 2007 - 2009 has everything somewhat tense. The Philadelphia International Airport currently has seven terminal buildings, each with their own lettered concourse. Carriers are clumped - Southwest has it's own area, which is currently being upgraded, while US Airways is merely maintaining its presence as domestic demand softens. International demand remains strong. Philadelphia has benefits from the overloading of JFK and LaGuardia as passengers who dislike delays are more and more often choosing to connect through Philly rather than sweat out a connection in NYC. The airport is also very accessible on the ground for locals and connecting travelers. Taxis charge a flat fare from the airport into the city. Regional rail service connections are available, making the whole Northeast Corridor a possibility. Bus lines run to the airport from all over the city. Additionally, the many universities in the area offer seasonal shuttles to students free of charge and parents can hitch rides without too much trouble on these shuttles at Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter and Spring Break route times."

"Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh is a Vibrant Garden and Greenhouse","Pennsylvania","Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh is a Vibrant Garden and Greenhouse","	Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Garden is an attraction in the Oakland community of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is located inside the city's Schenley Park, one of the largest green spaces in Pittsburgh. Phipps Conservatory was established in 1893, a result of Pittsburgh's City Beautiful movement of that era. It was originally stocked with tropical plants that were brought to the city from the World Exposition that took place in Chicago during that same year. Henry Phipps built it as a gift to the city and intended it to be both a place of enjoyment and a place of instruction where city residents could learn about the beauty and diversity of the outdoors. The Victorian-style conservatory was built by the New York firm of Lord and Burnham and it cost Phipps about $100,000. Phipps Conservatory was an instant hit. The Palm Court, one of the origin parts of the conservatory, remained the focal point of the structure. Similar to other conservatories around the country, the Palm Court was 65 feet tall at its highest point and housed a huge variety of tropical Palm trees. People arrived from far and wide to visit the attraction, the first of its kind in this area. The original conservatory contained nine rooms, but additions came quickly. The South Conservatory was added just a few years after the opening of Phipps Conservatory, and in 1902, Henry Phipps added a Cacti House, which introduced residents of Pittsburgh to the plants of the dry climates of the western United States. Visitors could peer into the room and take pictures, though they could not originally wander among the cacti. That was later changed and that same addition now carries the name Desert Room'' as the plant life inside is now more diverse. Rare orchids came soon afterward and special flower shows were held for Easter and other times of the year. The conservatory contained to grow for many years, with additions of fountains, new gardens such as a Japanese garden, and much more. Phipps was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Huge renovations were made a few years later, closing the attraction for more than 18 months. The one-acre Outdoor Garden was added in 1986 and the Japanese Courtyard Garden in 1991. A private organization gained management of the Phipps Conservatory in the late 1990s and since then, many additional improvements have been made including a new visitor center and an emphasis on green living became part of the plans for the 21st century, with groundbreaking for a new Center for Sustainable Landscapes'' happening in 2008. Visitors to Phipps Conservatory can enjoy five different kinds of tours these days. They include the self-guided kind as well as a docent-led tour, a tropical forest or greenhouse tour, or a green'' tour for the environmentally conscious. A number of special exhibits and events happen all year long including annual festivals and fundraisers for Phipps. Classes for both adults and children are well attended. They cover a variety of gardening- or horticulture-related topics such as landscape and garden design, botanical art and illustration, and botanical crafts for adults, and forest hikes, papermaking, and much more for the kids.

While the park remained a popular recreation area for decades, it experienced a considerable amount of decline by the beginning of the 21st century. Part of the reason for the deterioration of the park was because it had become the prime location for major outdoor events within the city. As Point State Park was not designed to hold large crowds, they took their toll on the park. In 2006, city officials proposed a major park renovation which included improvements to the park's landmark fountain, addition of seating areas, addition of kiosks and concessions, an improved riverwalk, and much more. The park closed for 18 months and reopened in the spring of 2008 but portions of the park remained closed on occasion as renovations continue. Today, the park is still improving and can be better enjoyed by visitors. One of the centerpieces of Point Park is the 200-foot-diamater fountain that sits at the headwaters of the Ohio River. The fountain sprays water up to 150 feet in the air and draws its water from an underground river that runs below the park. Paved wharfs along the riverfront provide places from which to enjoy the beauty of the river and fishing and boating are available there. There's also a system of bike trails that connect the park with other portions of the city. There are no playgrounds and organized sports are not allowed within the boundaries of the park in order to protect the rights and safety of others using the park. Point Park is the site of the annual Three Rivers Arts Festival, which generally occurs during the first two weeks of June. The festival features artists, live musical performances, dance and theater performances, and visual arts installations. It often draws a crowd in excess of a half million people. The park is also the site of the annual Dollar Bank Jamboree and the yearly Light Up Night, where visitors gather to enjoy the lighting of the city's Christmas tree."

"Ringing Rocks Park, a Great Philadelphia Day Trip","Pennsylvania","Ringing Rocks Park, a Great Philadelphia Day Trip"," Ringing Rocks Park is a 128 acre property that is located in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania. The property got its unusual name because some of the boulders in the park possess a unique quality: they make a ringing sound when struck. Not all of the boulders make this sound, and the reason that some do while others do not is one of the mysteries of the park. Only one third of the rocks ring while the rest make a noise that most rocks make when struck . The boulders are in a field which is located in the middle of the forest. How the boulders came to rest in the forest is yet another mystery.  The rocks are not uniform and are comprised of a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The boulders cover an area of about seven acres and it looks sort of like a dried up riverbed, but it is not. Some people think that the rocks could have an extraterrestrial origin, but there is nothing to support that type of speculation . While there are some mysteries surrounding the origins of the boulders in Ringing Rocks Park, one thing is certain and that is that people love to visit and bang around looking for live'' rocks. Live rocks are the ones that ring when they are hit, while the others are considered dead rocks. The boulders, while the main attraction, are not the only thing that the park has to offer visitors. The waterfalls, one of which is three stories high, freezes in the winter making for an unusual and beautiful sight. Other states boast ringing rocks but, interestingly, the others have a different make up than the Pennsylvania ringing rocks . The impressions on the rocks don't match the typical erosion patterns, which fuels the fire of those who like to blame the boulders on an other-worldly event . Upper Black Eddy is located in Bucks County and is about 60 miles from Philadelphia. Ringing Rock Park makes a great day trip, and you only need to plan on about two hours inside the park. It is an easy hike for most family members, but be sure to wear appropriate shoes. Also, bring your own hammer and your own water. Ringing Rocks Park is a good choice for an unusual trip that even young family members can enjoy."

"Roadside America","Pennsylvania","Roadside America - Shartlesville, PA - Miniature Railway and Village","Located off of Interstate 78 at Exit 23 in Shartlesville, Pennsylvania, Roadside America is in Berks County. Begun by Laurence Gieringer, Roadside America is an indoor miniature railway and village. Gieringer was fascinated with miniatures since he was a child. When he was 16, he became a carpenter and painter. His hobby was making model buildings. His collection of miniatures grew, as did the word of mouth about his miniature village. In 1935, he set up his display for his children. The Reading Eagle newspaper published a story on his display that year, leading to additional public interest in Gieringer's miniatures. This led to what is now known as Roadside America. The display is roughly 8,000 square feet and consists of approximately 4,000 miniature people and 400 miniature buildings. Roadside America's summer season runs from July through Labor Day. All other times are considered to be part of the winter season. During the summer season, Roadside America is open 9:00am to 6:30pm on weekdays and 9:00am to 7:00pm on weekends. During the winter season, regular hours of operation are 10:00am to 5:00pm on weekdays and 10:00am to 6:00pm on weekends. The attraction is closed on Christmas Day. Admission for adults (ages 12 and up) is $6. The admission fee for children between 6 and 11 years of age is $3. Children 5 years of age and younger receive free admission. Group rates are available by calling 610-488-6241 between 10:00am and 5:00pm. Groups must consist of 25 people or more, and group reservations should be made at least one week in advance. It is recommended that visitors allow at least one hour for their visit. Ample parking is available onsite, and there is no parking fee. Roadside America is a sprawling exhibit. It depicts villages from different time periods. The display includes detailed villages from the pioneer days through the present era. The detail of each village is remarkable. The exhibit depicts American villages and some villages in foreign countries, but the main focus is rural Pennsylvania. One of the features of the exhibit is a Pennsylvania Dutch farm. The scale used when creating the exhibit was three-eighths of an inch to one foot. Even using such a scale, there were many materials needed. Some of the materials used in the creation of Roadside America include 4,000 pounds of sheet iron, 17,700 board feet of lumber, 10,000 miniature trees that were handmade, and 2,250 feet of railroad and trolley tracks. The exhibit also uses 5 electric pumps that handle 6,000 gallons of water per hour. Visitors are welcome to take photographs of the exhibit. The exhibit is an educational one as well since the villages and settings encompass art, geography, landscaping, and history. In addition to the many miniatures, Roadside America is an exhibit that is constantly moving. Trains glide over bridges and through tunnels, and a miniature zoo features a bubbling fountain. A grist mill grinds grain into flour in one part of the exhibit while a mountain trolley moves through a woodland area in another section of the miniature village. Additional information regarding Roadside America can be obtained by calling 610-488-6241."

The Winery is located on the Delaware River, southeast of Allentown in Bucks County. Joseph and Paul Maxian, from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, came to America in 1969. In the 1970s, the Maxians purchased the current property. The property is roughly 72 acres. The Maxians planted the first Vitis vinifera seedlings in 1985. Over fifty-thousand plants were hand planted. The vineyard pruned and buried the vines by hand in the winter, and then uncovered them each spring. The first vintage was produced in 1987. The first production was of Chardonnay and Riesling wines. Sand Castle wines are made from harvests that are exclusive to their vineyard, and are bottled on site. Currently, there are twelve different wines that are produced by Sand Castle. These include: varieties of Riesling, varieties of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Blush, and Alpine Spice. The wine products can be purchased online at the Sand Castle Winery website, or at local retailers. A number of restaurants also serve Sand Castle Winery products. On the website, their most popular wine is the Cabernet Sauvignon 2004. It sells for $17 a bottle. It has hints of sweet oak, almond, and vanilla butter. Riesling wines are the Winery's pride. Riesling grapes are originally from regions in Germany. They must be cultivated carefully, because they are a more delicate grape. The grapes and the wines produced from them are typically flowery or fruity in flavor. However when the grapes are damaged they produce a more sour, coarser taste. The Johannisberg Riesling 2004 currently sold by Sand Castle, costs $16 a bottle, or $13.60 a bottle if a dozen or more are purchased. Sand Castle Winery offers membership to the Sand Castle Wine Club. There is no fee to join and members receive a ten percent discount on merchandise.

Both memberships also receive the option for selecting specialty wines exclusive to club members. Gift certificates are available through the website and by calling 1-800-722-9463.

Its major attractions include many rides and activities that are designed to appeal to children in the Sesame Street age group. There are, however, many attractions that will also appeal to older children and adults. The actual count of 17 dry rides and over a dozen major water rides doesn't do justice to the number of attractions and activities available for children and families at Sesame Place. The newest attraction, for instance, is the Count's Splash Castle, opened in 2009. Though it has no rides'', it features over 90 play elements on multiple levels, including several water slides, water curtains, hose jets, water wheels and a one-thousand gallon tipping bucket - in other words, enough activities to easily occupy a young child for hours.

The rafts traverse a path that takes it under gigantic toys and up over six story high hills before eventually dumping into an enormous pool. Also in the thrill ride category is the Vapor Trail, a steel roller coaster that is built to be a child's first roller coaster ride''. Another popular attraction is Elmo's World, opened in 2006. It features three dry rides, each of them themed to parts of Elmo's imaginary world. Peek-A-Bug takes children through Elmo's oversized garden. Flying Fish fly through imaginary seas, and Blast Off is a high-jumper ride that bounces them into outer space''. In addition to the rides, families can take a walk through Sesame Neighborhood, a replica of the Sesame Street set that includes life-size recreations of Bert and Ernie's House, Engine House #1 and Mr. MacIntosh's Fruit Stand. Sesame Playhouse is a kid-size arcade featuring games of skill with a chance to earn points and prizes, and Monster Maze is a fun and challenging obstacle course'' where the obstacles are lightweight punching bags that swing back into the way as soon as they are pushed aside. Sesame Street characters are also in evidence throughout the park. The entire crew marches through the center of the park twice a day in the Rock Around the Block Parade.

"Shriver House Museum in Gettysburg is a Civil War Era Must-See","Pennsylvania","Shriver House Museum in Gettysburg is a Civil War Era Must-See","	The Shriver House Museum is a Civil War-era attraction located in the heart of the historic district of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a town in the south central portion of the state. Built in 1860, shortly before the start of the Civil War, the house in which the museum is situated was once the home of George and Hettie Shriver and their young daughters, Sadie and Molly. The museum attempts to show the civilian experience'' and during the Battle of Gettysburg and other trials of the Civil War. In order to achieve that goal, the home was restored to its original mid 19th century appearance in 1996 and opened as a heritage museum shortly thereafter. Tours of the home are conducted by uniformed docents who try to stay in character and answer questions as if they were present during the Civil War. Guests have the opportunity to view the era through the eyes of George and Hettie Shriver, particularly how the war impacted their lives and the lives of their children. Aside from learning about the war and the local Battle of Gettysburg, visitors get a look at Civil War-era life in general including lifestyles, customs, and furnishings of that period. Guests are able to visit each and every room in the Shriver household. Of particular interest to many visitors is the Confederate sharpshooter's nest in the attic, where written accounts confirm that at least two soldiers were killed. Guests can position themselves in the nest and get a bird's eye view of the Gettysburg area. Visitors can also head to Mr. Shriver's business, a saloon, located in the cellar area of the house. Each year around the Fourth of July, the Shriver House Museum sponsors a reenactment where Confederates arrive at the home of the Shrivers and commence to occupy it, just as they did during the three-day Battle of Gettysburg. Guests are invited to view the reenactment and to speak to the soldiers'' to garner first hand information as to what transpired during those three days in July 1863. Visitors will hear how Hettie attempted escape with her girls and a neighbor's child, eventually winding up in the thick of the war. Sharpshooters fire muskets from the attic and a makeshift hospital is set up in the home's summer kitchen. After watching the reenactment and touring the home, visitors can enjoy a root beer in the saloon. Local citizens'' gather there to share more stories. The museum also conducts Christmas Candlelight Tours each year from Thanksgiving until approximately the week before Christmas. During this time, the home is decorated for the holidays as it would have been during the 1860s. Tours include cider and holiday treats. Groups are welcome with advance reservations. The Shriver House Museum in Gettysburg has been recognized by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission's Historic Preservation Award and has been used as a filming site for many Civil War-era productions on networks such as Discovery Channel, Travel Channel, CNN, PBS, and the History Channel."

"South Street in Philadelphia is a Quirky Entertainment Area","Pennsylvania","South Street in Philadelphia is a Quirky Entertainment Area","	South Street is an east-west thoroughfare in the city of Philadelphia, running from Front Street at the Delaware River through the downtown area, ending at the Schuylkill River. The most popular and lively part of South Street is located between Front Street and 10th. Parts of this area are also sometimes known as the Headhouse District. The street now labeled as South was originally called Cedar Street and it represented the southernmost boundary of the city of Philadelphia. When neighboring townships were added to the city, the street's name was changed. In the early to mid 20th century, South Street was akin to New York's Garment District and consistently mainly of stores that sold fabric, men's suits, and other similar handmade garments. In the early 1960s, South Street and the garment district were threatened with extinction when a proposed cross-town expressway was to make its way through that portion of the city. Both businesses and residents began moving out and property was cheap, attracting starving artists, musicians, and others looking for affordable housing. Many of the warehouses were turned into studios. The expressway never came to be but the neighborhood remained a haven for artists of all kinds. By the 1970s and 1980s, the South Street of today began to take shape. Numerous small restaurants and night clubs opened and the area became popular with young adults. Bar hopping was a regular pastime and some of Philadelphia's young musical acts got their start in the clubs on South Street, including Robert Hazard. As the years waned, the tourist population took its toll on the residents of the area and most moved out and sold to businesses. Today, the neighborhood is more a tourist attraction than a place to call home. The area is quite popular with local teenagers who like to shop in South Street's quirky stores, but especially young adults, who arrive from other parts of the city and suburbs to enjoy the nightlife just about every day of the week but especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. Some 50 restaurants and bars line the street and the little side streets off South, so there's a huge choice of cuisine. Nighttime means live music at many establishments, featuring a variety of types of music from jazz to ethnic fare. Pieces of the Garment District, now dubbed Fabric Row, still exist, especially around the area of 4th and South Streets. Fabric stores, drapery workrooms, interior decorators, furniture stores, and more can be found in this general area and the prices can be quite good in comparison to similar stores elsewhere. Also along South Street patrons can find nail and hair salons, the occasional art gallery, flower shops, bakeries, electronics stores, coffee shops, and much more, most located on the first floor of buildings that once functioned as residences for earlier Philadelphia residents. But South Street also has its slightly sleazy side. It's not unusual to find the occasional sex shop as well as tattoo parlors and body piercing establishments. For a long time, it was the center of the punk movement in Philadelphia and there are still shops that cater to those who prefer similar styles."

"Squirrel Hill Neighborhood of Pittsburgh a Desirable Place to Live","Pennsylvania","Squirrel Hill Neighborhood of Pittsburgh a Desirable Place to Live","	Squirrel Hill, a largely residential neighborhood, is situated at the east end of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Often divided into Squirrel Hill North and Squirrel Hill South, it boasts about 25,000 residents and is bordered on the east by Frick Park and the west by Schenley Park. Squirrel Hill began in the early 1800s as a prosperous suburb of the city. For more than 100 years, some of the most affluent families in Pittsburgh made their homes in the neighborhood. Chatham University also chose Squirrel Hill as its location and retains an important presence in the area. With the addition of an electric trolley line in 1893, the make up of the area changed a bit. Middle management from local factories moved in and dozens of smaller homes were built. In the early 1900s, Squirrel Hill was the home of author Willa Cather, who worked for the local newspaper as a drama critic and taught English at Central High School. Since the 1920s, Squirrel Hill has had a large Jewish population and has been considered the center of Jewish culture for Jews in and around the city. According to a recent study, about one-third of Pittsburgh Jewish population live in this neighborhood, which now includes more than 20 synagogues and several Jewish day schools for the Hasidic, Modern Orthodox, and Conservative sects of Judaism. It is also not unusual to find a number of Kosher restaurants and other facilities that cater to the population as well. There are, however, people of other religious persuasions that live in Squirrel Hill and there is an active Episcopalian church in the neighborhood as well as a private Episcopalian elementary school. Carnegie Mellon University also has a few facilities in the neighborhood. The fact that Squirrel Hill is bordered by both Frick and Schenley Park make it a desirable place for those who enjoy outdoor recreation. Biking, walking, and roller blading are quite popular in both parks and there are also ice skating facilities, tennis courts, and - not far away - a few places to enjoy a game of golf. The neighborhood is also well known for its eclectic eateries. Aside from restaurants that serve Kosher food and non-Kosher Jewish delicacies, there is also a good mix of other ethnic restaurants in Squirrel Hill, including Russian, Thai, Mexican, and Indian. Many of them are quite affordable, catering to the student populations at Chatham and Carnegie Mellon. There are also numerous bakeries and candy shops for all to enjoy and coffee houses are aplenty as well. There are a few night spots in the neighborhood that offer live music, and two small movie theaters can also be found in Squirrel Hill, showing both first-run and independent films. Housing in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh ranges from stately and expensive homes that were built more than a century ago to modern apartments that house college students. Also, a number of older homes have been sub-divided for the convenience of renting to these same students."

"Station Square in Pittsburgh is a Dining","Pennsylvania","Station Square in Pittsburgh is a Dining, Shopping, and Entertainment Destination","	Station Square, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a 52-acre riverfront multi-use complex that stretches for more than a mile and includes about two dozen restaurants, a plethora of stores, and several entertainment options. The site on which Station Square is located was once the freight terminal for the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie (P&LE) Railroad. The complex once included a huge terminal, an extensive freight station, a seven story warehouse, an express house and several other minor buildings. Due to the demise of rail travel by the 1960s and 1970s, the terminal was destined to remain vacant for many years, but in 1976, the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation decided to step in and develop the site. The property was adapted for several different kinds of new uses including a hotel. In 1994, the foundation sold to a private developer who expanded the hotel and added what is now known as the Bessemer Court Entertainment District. Today, Station Square is popular with both locals and visitors of all ages. Some of the old buildings on the property were retained, like the 1900-built Landmarks Building, which was once the train terminal. These days, the seven-story building houses some of the complex's most popular restaurants as well as office space. Also remaining is an old train shed, now known as the Train House Shops. This restored railroad building now houses 20 very unique shops that sell everything from toys to cigars. Much of what's found at Pittsburgh's Station Square, however, is new. The restaurants here range from well-known fast food spots to common chain eateries like The Melting Pot, Hard Rock Caf,, and Buca di Beppo, to unique restaurants like the Pittsburgh Rare Steakhouse, the Grand Concourse Seafood Emporium, and the Gandy Dancer Saloon, complete with raw bar and pasta station. Nightclubs and other night spots are also plentiful in the Bessemer Court district. Most include not only places to grab a drink but many also boast live entertainment and plenty of room to dance. There's also a comedy club at this location. Visitors can catch a ride on one of the boats of the Gateway Clipper Fleet, which dock at the marina at Station Square. Excursions include sightseeing or dinner cruises or guests can hop a boat for a ride to PNC Park or Heinz Field for a Pirates or Steelers game. Just Ducky amphibious sightseeing tours also depart from Station Square near the Hard Rock Caf,.

Children under sixteen must be accompanied by an adult at all times when visiting the historic site. One of the steams trains was built in 1923 and takes passengers and crew through the northern Pennsylvania countryside. There are guided tours seven days a week with varying times. It is best to call for information about when the excursions leave the station. There is a working roundhouse on the property so that the steam engines can be kept in optimal condition. They must be maintained daily with grease and oil plus an inspection. The turntable that is on the premises turns the engines so that they go to the proper area for maintenance. The forty acres that make up the park are open to the public. Picnic tables and areas to relax outside of the museum are available. Walking tours may be part of the day's festivities. Children can become Junior Rangers when they visit the site and there are other programs for younger children as well. The museum that is at Steamtown talks about what life was like for the workers of the railroad. The fireman'' was in charge of shoveling coal into the firebox. They were known to shovel up to 200 pounds in a minute; this is one of the reasons that an automated shoveler was invented. The museum tells the stories of the Pullman Porters that organized the first union that allowed African American members. The Steamtown National Historic Site has two different types of admission. The first one is the Park Fee and anyone seventeen or older must pay six dollars. This fee allows visitors access to the grounds, the History Museum, Theater, railroad yard, Technology Museum, and Roundhouse.

"Stonewall Old (South) Course","Pennsylvania","Stonewall Old (South) Course, Elverson, Pennsylvania - A Tom Doak-Designed Golf Course With Plenty of Challenge","The facilities at Stonewall include two 18-hole, championship-caliber golf courses - the North Course and the Old (South) Course - both the design work of Tom Doak. Doak has a reputation as a minimalist'' when it comes to course design, and firmly believes in the lay-of-the-land'' approach, which makes use of existing contours of the landscape and calls for moving as little earth as possible. The par-70 Old Course, which opened in 1993, is relatively short, playing to only 6,717 yards from the longest (Black) tees, with a USGA rating of 72.9 and a slope rating of 132 on Bent grass. From the Blue tees the course plays to 6,322 yards. According to members, however, there is still plenty of challenge to be found on the layout, where water and 104 sand bunkers provide the primary hazards. On the front nine, every hole with the exception of No. 7 is guarded at some point with a wetland, stream or pond. Such hazards rarely call for a forced carry, but do serve to punish wayward shots to either side. The front nine also includes a mix of holes that are wide open and wooded. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 5, a par-3 that plays to 197 yards from the longest tees. The tee shot features a dramatic drop to the green and calls for a shot that must carry wetlands while avoiding a bunker on the left and a stream on the right. No. 6 is a strong par-4 that plays to 442 yards from the back tees. Like its processor, this hole plays from an elevated tee which requires carrying the creek at the bottom of the fairway. On the back nine, players may find themselves experiencing a feeling of freedom and open spaces that is reminiscent of seaside British courses. There is much more movement on this side of the course, and holes such as Nos. 14, 16 and 18 all feature downhill shots to the green, which makes choosing the right club of utmost importance. No. 18, in particular, is a grand finishing hole, a par-5 that plays to 451 yards from the longest tees. The hole plays downhill every step of the way, however, and is reachable in two as a result. The hole also features a generous landing area guarded by bunkers on both sides of the fairway. Of even greater concern is the sand that fronts the entrance to the green and guards the putting surface on the right. The finishing green also slopes from front to back, and all those features contributed to the hole being ranked among The 18 Best Holes in the U.S. in The Confidential Guide. The Old Course has also been ranked among the Top 100 Golf Course in the U.S. by GOLF Magazine, and has also hosted a number of prestigious events, including the Pennsylvania Open and the Philadelphia Open. Practice facilities include a driving range and short-game practice area, a golf shop, restaurant, and two golf houses with overnight accommodations."

"The Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh is a Sight to Behold both Inside and Outside","Pennsylvania","The Cathedral of Learning in Pittsburgh is a Sight to Behold both Inside and Outside","	The Cathedral of Learning is a 42-story Gothic Revival building located on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh. At 535 feet tall, this structure is the largest educational structure in the Western Hemisphere and the second-tallest university building in the world. The Cathedral of Learning was proposed in 1921 by John Gabbert Bowman, the tenth chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh. He envisioned a tall building that would not only alleviate the crowding in the World War I-era buildings that lined the campus but also one that would be a dramatic symbol of education'' for the city of Pittsburgh. Bowman chose a 14-acre plot of land called Frick Acres for the site of the Cathedral of Learning and hired renowned Gothic Revival architect, Charles Klauder of Philadelphia, to come up with a novel design. Klauder wanted to combine the modern ideals of a skyscraper with the traditions of Gothic design. Bowman loved the design but many locals were opposed. Because of that, he ordered that the construction of the walls start at the top so the project couldn't be cancelled. For just 10 cents, local school children could buy a brick in the much-anticipated structure and many funds were raised in that manner. Building began in 1926 and was completed in 1937. A steel frame overlaid with Indiana limestone, the Cathedral of Learning includes 2,000 rooms and more than 2,500 windows. The first 36 floors are used primarily for educational purposes and include a massive lobby, also known as the Commons Room, which features a general study area and plenty of space for special events. The ceilings of the Commons Room are 52 feet tall and the space covers more than 1 half-acre. Of particular note are the 27 Nationality Rooms located inside the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning. Located on the first and third floors, each of these rooms was designed to celebrate a culture that had an influence of Pittsburgh's growth. People of each of the celebrated nationalities would be responsible for designing their room and materials, labor, and design were provided by each committee. The nationalities represented include African, Armenian, Austrian, Chinese, Czechoslovakian, English, Early American (display room only), French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indian, Irish, Israeli, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Scottish, Swedish, Syrian-Lebanese (display room), Ukrainian, Welsh, and Yugoslavian. Other nationality rooms are currently being planned. In addition to the Nationality Rooms, the Cathedral of Learning also includes the Croghan-Schenley Ballroom, two rooms that were originally part of Croghan's early 19th century mansion; the Mulert Memorial Room with its rich woods and ionic columns; the Darlington Memorial Library, with a collection that focuses on American history and literature including rare maps and atlases; the Braun Room, designed specifically as a place for women of the university to meet; and the Studio Theater, a black box-style theater that is used for student-directed productions, play readings, and the popular Friday Night Improvs, initiated by graduate students more than 20 years ago. Recently, much of the exterior stonework of the Cathedral of Learning has been restored and the university is attempting to secure enough money to install central air conditioning in the building, which now contains some 200 window unit air conditioners."
"The Central Market in Lancaster is More than a Fruit and Vegetable Stand","Pennsylvania","The Central Market in Lancaster is More than a Fruit and Vegetable Stand","	The Central Market in Lancaster, located in Pennsylvania Dutch Country, is the country's oldest farmers' market. Situated in the center of the town and designated as one of America's Great Public Spaces'', the market dates back to 1742 when it was chartered by King George II to the city of Lancaster, making Lancaster an official royal market town.'' For centuries, the market has been a central gathering place for those who live and work in the Lancaster area and is known as the premiere location to buy the freshest locally grown food. USA Today has dubbed it the 4th best market in the United States to visit'' and many other travel and food publications have profiled the Central Market. The current market house at Lancaster's Central Market was built in 1889 by English architect James H. Warner, who eventually became a resident of the city. Warner was well known for his ecclesiastic architecture and for building structures with large roofs. He chose the Romanesque Revival style for this market building, The exterior focus of the building is the twin towers that soar some 72 feet into the air, situated on the south corners and covered with Spanish tiling and terra cotta finials. The interior measures about 20,000 square feet and originally housed 160 farmers' and truckers' stalls, 72 butchers' and 20 fish stalls-252 all together,'' according to historians' records. Nowadays, the Central Market in Lancaster is home to about 60 market stands offering a variety of foodstuffs and other items. Because of modern equipment such as refrigeration units and other necessities for keeping food fresh and safe, far fewer stalls are found at the market today. While meat, poultry, and produce stands dominated the stalls in the early market, today there is a much wider selection of goods to enjoy. Because the market is in the midst of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, the Amish people are a regular fixture here, offering a huge variety of items ranging from meats from hand-raised animals, dairy, baked goods, maple syrup, produce, breads, candy, and much more. Well-known local specialties, like Utz Potato Chips, can also be purchased here. Other nationalities are represented at the Central Market as well, including stands that sell Greek specialties, Jewish deli items, Latino prepared foods, German lunchmeats and other delicatessen items, and Italian food. In addition to food, visitors to Lancaster's Central Market can also find flowers, candles, baskets, handicrafts, gifts, and a variety of souvenirs reflecting the culture of the Lancaster area. The Central Market is open year round but only on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The market opens early in the morning and is filled during those hours with chefs and owners of local restaurants who head there for the freshest food of the day for their eateries. It closes at 4 pm on Tuesday and Friday and at 2 pm on Saturday. The market sponsors occasional special events, usually during regular operating hours."

"The Choo Choo Barn And The Shops Of Traintown - Strasburg, Pennsylvania animated train display and tourist attraction","Pennsylvania","The Choo Choo Barn And The Shops Of Traintown - Strasburg, Pennsylvania animated train display and tourist attraction","In 1945, George Groff set up a Lionel train set in his basement for his son Gary. This was the beginnings of The Choo Choo Barn, a large train display and tourist attraction located in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. Over the next several years, the Groff family train began to take over their basement, and they opened their home to school groups and neighbors during the holiday season. In 1961, in order to bring in some side income for his son's college tuition, Groff moved the display to a barn-like building and set up an exhibit of over 600 square feet of landscaping, which included six trains and a number of other moving features. Today, The Choo Choo Barn also has a number of specialty shops called the Shops of Traintown. These were opened in 1989 to give visitors a number of shopping options in addition to the large toy train display. The first of these shops, which is still one of the most popular today, was Railroad Books and Videos, which has novelty items, memorabilia, posters, train artwork, and, as the name implies, books and videos. At Railroad Books and Videos, guests can also find a large collection of new and used toy trains, so many visitors stop in to look for the trains and train cars they had as children. They also have Candy Junction, with sweet treats for all ages, as well as Country Keepsakes, which has crafts made by local artists along with collectibles. Children enjoy Thomas' Trackside Station. Opened in 1993, this shop is the only store in the United States that is 100% dedicated to Thomas the Tank Engine. Guests who are hungry can also stop by the attraction's deli and make use of the free picnic grove area. Along with these shops, The Choo Choo Barn and Shops of Traintown also caters to people who want to build their own home toy train display. In 1983, the Groff children, who took over the tourist attraction from the elder Groff, opened the Strasburg Train Shop, a store specifically for those building displays. This shop is nationally known as a place to get small items for scenes that can't be found anywhere else. Every year, The Choo Choo Barn closes from January through March. During these three months, the Groff family sets up new displays, and the exhibit grows and changes. Since many of the scenes include moving parts, this is also an opportunity for the Groffs to repair anything that broke during the rest of the year. Although there is something new to see every year, there are also still old favorites, and these scenes have been part of the display since the beginning. Some of the original displays include the skiing and ice skating area, the tobacco farm, and the firehouse. The Choo Choo Barn is open daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM from the first weekend of March to December 31. The Strasburg Train Shop and other stores that are part of the Shops of Traintown are open 10:00 Am to 5:00 PM year-round.

"The Golf Course at Glen Mills","Pennsylvania","The Golf Course at Glen Mills, Glen Mills, Pennsylvania - Rated the Best Public Golf Course in Pennsylvania by Golfweek Magazine","The Golf Course at Glen Mills has a rather unique story. It was built in 2001 on the grounds of the Glen Mills School in suburban Philadelphia, which is the oldest residential school in the country for court-referred young men. In existence since 1826, the school is in essence a private reform school for boys ages 15-18 who have run afoul of the law. The boys work at the course, learning turf management and golf operations, and the greens fees help support the student programs. The course is a Bobby Weed design and offers a good deal of variety in its layout. The front nine has a bit of an old-time flavor,'' as the first four holes have an open feel, but after that the course heads into woodlands for a more traditional parkland layout. The back nine holes play through a valley and the golf becomes more target-oriented'' with a more modern feel to the course. The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to a relatively short 6,636 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 71.0 and a slope rating of 131 on Bent grass. It's been said that high-handicappers will probably have a difficult time on this course, which features some tight driving holes, forced carries and some bunkering that features irregularly shaped traps, many of which are rimmed with high grass. There are also some nasty pot bunkers along the way. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 2, which is named Coffin.'' This hole is a long par-4 that features six fairway bunkers to challenge players off the tee, followed by a green guarded by a coffin'' pot bunker that golfers will want to avoid at all costs. Hole No. 7 is a par-3 named Hell.'' The hole plays to 221 yards from the longest tees and uphill as well. The hole is cut out of the hill to the left and is guarded by bunkers on the right. The real difficulty, however, is a green that has no fewer than four levels, making putting a challenge in itself. Hole No. 16 is named Pond'' and is another par-3 that calls for some steady nerves. The hole plays to 156 yards from the back tees to a green bordered by a pond on the front and right. Playing left might seem like the safer play, except for the three sand bunkers that will leave any players that find them with a sand shot back toward the water hazard. Since its opening, the Golf Course at Glen Mills has received many accolades. Golf Digest ranked it #7 among Best New Upscale Courses in 2001, GOLF Magazine ranked it #5 on its Top 10 You Can Play list in 2002, and Golfweek rated it the best public golf course in Pennsylvania in 2003. Practice facilities at the course include a driving range with grass teeing area and a short-game practice area with a sand bunker. The course also features a Victorian-style Clubhouse, which is home to a pro shop and a snack shop."

"The Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark in Altoona, PA - Historic Railroad Horseshoe Curve","Pennsylvania","The Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark in Altoona, PA - Historic Railroad Horseshoe Curve","The Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark is located on Glenwhite Road in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Situated to the west of south Altoona, Horseshoe Curve is only a short distance past the Kittanning Reservoir and Lake Altoona. Horseshoe Curve is a railroad horseshoe curve that was completed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1854. The rails were later used by Penn Central and then by Conrail. Currently, Norfolk Southern Railway owns and operates this section of the railroad. Amtrak's passenger train called the Pennsylvanian also traverses this curve. The Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark preserves a stretch of railroad that was designed so that it would loop around a difficult section of the valley in a semicircle. The backside of the Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark is surrounded by mountains, and there is a scenic view of the surrounding valley. John Edgar Thompson was responsible for the engineering plan that used the surrounding landscape and approximately 450 Irish immigrant workers to create Horseshoe Curve. In 1966, Horseshoe Curve was designated as a National Historic Landmark. Horseshoe is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Regular hours of operation for the Horseshoe Curve are from sunrise to sunset daily. Visitors can still get a view from the rails by riding on the funicular, which is and incline trolley that leads directly up to the railroad tracks. In addition, visitors can also get a view from the rails by hiking the steep steps up to the railway. While there is a charge for riding on the funicular, there is no admission fee charged for entry to Horseshoe Curve. The arc that forms Horseshoe Curve is 220 degrees and actually consists of two curves. The north side has 637-foot radius, and the south side has a radius of 609 feet. The horseshoe curve of the rails is 1,800 feet across, and the length of the curve is 2,375 feet. There is a 9 degree and 15 minute degree of curvature. The east side of the curve is actually 122 feet lower than the west side of the curve. The grade of the curve is 91 feet per mile, and the east end elevation is 1,594 feet above sea level. When the curve was originally built, it consisted of two tracks. Somewhere between 1898 and 1900, it was widened to four tracks. In 1981, Conrail removed one of the tracks, and the tracks have remained in this three-track configuration ever since. With help from the National Park Service, renovations were made in 1992, and visitors were then able to ride on the incline to the tracks. In addition, upper and lower picnic areas were established, and a Visitors Center with a small restaurant was created. The Visitors Center has a trackside observation area that is open from April through October. This area is managed by the Railroaders Memorial Museum. Geologists have noted that the area around the Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark contains remarkable rock outcroppings, which include the Devonian Catskill Formation.

"The Italian Market in Philadelphia is a Unique Cultural Experience","Pennsylvania","The Italian Market in Philadelphia is a Unique Cultural Experience","	The Italian Market is the name given to an approximately six block stretch of 9th Street in South Philadelphia, from Fitzwater to Wharton Streets. A traditional outdoor curb market, the Italian Market - often referred to by locals simply as 9th Street'' - has long been the site of curbside produce stands and small privately-owned markets that occupy the first floor of many traditional Philadelphia row homes. The history of the Italian Market dates back to the late 19th and early 20th century when the area known as South Philadelphia - which was outside city limits - became a mecca for Italian immigrants. Most arrived in the 1880s and settled at the boardinghouse of Antonio Palumbo, later earning enough money to buy their own homes and open their own retail establishments. Most offered items that would make the new immigrants feel at home, such as homemade pastas and meats, vegetables, and fruit that traditionally accompanied Italian meals. Many of today's vendors are from families that have owned their shops since the early days of the market. Most of what visitors will find at the Italian Market today isn't much different than what could be found there 100 years ago. Proprietors still make fresh pasta on site. Others make homemade Italian sausage or crusty Italian bread and rolls. Some stores sell dozens of varieties of cheeses while others offer traditional Italian baked goods, such as cannoli, biscotti, tiramisu, and much more. Throughout the year, many of the stores peddle their produce or other items outside on tables perched beneath colorful awnings. Large barrels filled with blazing fires keep patrons warm while they shop outdoors during the cold winter months. Many of the shop owners continue to live above their stores, much as they have since the inception of the Italian Market in Philadelphia but some travel into the city each day from the suburbs to tend their stores. In recent years, as the area around the market became more gentrified, restaurants and small bistro-style eateries have popped up throughout the neighborhood, offering sumptuous cuisine with outdoor seating during the warmer months. The ethnic make-up of the neighborhood surrounding the Italian Market, commonly known as Bella Vista, has changed a lot in the last 10-20 years. Today, new immigrants have taken up residence in the area and many of them have opened stores as well. It is not uncommon to see Mexican, Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese businesses interspersed with the Italian-oriented shops. The Mexican shops are especially prevalent and most are tended my Latino immigrants, many of whom have recently arrived in the city. The Italian Market attracts visitors from far and wide. Many suburbanites or former city residents travel to South Philadelphia from around the Greater Delaware Valley area specifically to shop at the Italian Market. The market also plays host each year to the Italian Market Festival, an event that also brings visitors from all over the city and beyond. At the festival, guests can enjoy not only excellent Italian specialties but also ethnic music, dance, and other arts-related performances."

"The Liberty Bell And Independence Hall In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania","The Liberty Bell And Independence Hall In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"," The Liberty Bell has long stood as a symbol of freedom for many people around the United States. On July 8th, 1776, the bell rang out across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for the first time. The loud chiming announced the first ever public reading of the Declaration of Independence from Independence Hall.  Through the years, the bell was adopted as a symbol for Native American Indians, suffragists and abolitionists across the United States. The bell was commissioned by the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1751, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of William Penn's, 1701 Charter of Privileges. The bell was cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London England. On the first of September 1752 the bell arrived in Philadelphia. But, the bell was not actually hung until March 10, 1753 with the inscription Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all inhabitants therefore,'' from Leviticus 25:10. Which is still relevant to what our country stands for to this day. There has always been disagreements on how the Liberty Bell got its famous crack. Many believe the crack was caused by a flaw in the casting or the combination of metals used. The first time the bell was rang in July of 1776, caused its first series of cracks. The bell was then recast three times by John Stow and John Dock Pass of Philadelphia in the hope that adding more copper would help sturdy the bell and would improve the tone of the bell. The largest crack on the Liberty Bell that rendered the bell unusable was on the 100th  anniversary of Washington's birthday in 1846. After the Civil War many Americans were looking for a symbol of unity to help heal the nation. The Liberty Bell became one of those symbols to the American people. The bell was tolled upon the deaths of Presidents Hamilton, Adams and Jefferson. In 1852, the bell was removed from the rotting wooden steeple and put on display in Independence Hall. During 1885 through 1915, the Liberty Bell was put on a train and taken to various locations throughout the United States. On January 1, 1976 during the American bicentennial celebration, the bell was moved from Independence Hall and taken to a glass pavilion across the street, this location is now called the Liberty Bell Center. As of 2006, the bell has remained in the Liberty Bell Center, where every year, thousands of tourists gather to ponder this great symbol of American heritage. Every year on July 4th, descendants of the signers of the Declaration of Independence gather to tap the bell, thirteen times in honor of the patriots, of the original thirteen states. Though there is no admission fee to view the bell, strict security measures are taken to protect the bell. The Liberty Bell is still a well known attraction that stands in testament of honor, liberty and freedom for all."
"The Liberty Bell Center is a Philadelphia Must-Do for All Visitors","Pennsylvania","The Liberty Bell Center is a Philadelphia Must-Do for All Visitors","	The Liberty Bell Center is an historic attraction in Center City Philadelphia that houses the famous Liberty Bell as well as other related attractions. It is situated near most of the city's other great historic sites, including Independence Hall, Franklin Court, Old Christ Church, and the U.S. Constitution Center. It is operated by the United States National Park Service and is part of Independence National Historic Park. The Liberty Bell Center was opened in 2003, providing a safe and secure location for the famed Liberty Bell after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Previous to that time, the bell was located in an unsecured location near the current building. Today, guests must pass through a bag check and metal detector before entering the Liberty Bell Center. The Liberty Bell first rang in the tower of Independence Hall in 1776. Created to commemorate the golden anniversary of Penn's Charter, the bell eventually developed a crack and was deemed un-ringable in 1846. Nonetheless, it had already become a symbol of liberty and shared a close relationship to the Declaration of Independence. Each year, hundreds of thousands of visitors get close to the bell, which weighs about a ton and is made of 70% copper, 25% tin, and small amounts of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold, and silver. It still hangs from what experts say is its original yoke, fashioned from American elm. Upon entering the Liberty Bell Center, guests can view a video presentation about the bell as well as a variety of exhibits that focus on the origins of the bell as well as its role as an icon of freedom in today's world. Guests can hear taped presentations recorded in more than a dozen languages, making the Liberty Bell Center a truly international attraction. At the end of the long building, visitors reach the bell, which is displayed in a glass chamber with an excellent view of Independence Hall in the background. Guests can take turns posing in front of the bell for photographs. Park rangers are on hand both inside and outside the Liberty Bell Center to answer questions about the bell and its history. The Liberty Bell Center and most of the other attractions located inside Independence National Historic Park are open daily year round. There is no admission charge for any of these attractions. Hours are generally extended during the summer months and during Freedom Week (July 1 to 5). While timed tickets are required to visit Independence Hall, tickets are not required to enter the Liberty Bell Center. Visitors should expect, however, to wait in the security line, especially during the very busy summer months when Philadelphia is teeming with tourists. Also, guests may need to wait their turn to take their place beside the bell for photos and should be courteous to others waiting for the same opportunity."

"The Manayunk Neighborhood of Philadelphia has a Rich Immigrant History","Pennsylvania","The Manayunk Neighborhood of Philadelphia has a Rich Immigrant History","	Manayunk is a neighborhood situated in the northwest section of the city of Philadelphia. Once its own entity, it has been considered part of Philadelphia since 1854 through a law known as the Act of Consideration. The name of the area comes from the Lenape (Delaware) Indian word manaiung'', which means river'' or, more literally, place to drink.'' William Penn purchased this piece of land from the Lenapes during the 18th century. Manayunk sits near the Schuylkill River, just south of the Wissahickon Creek. The first person to build a home in the area, originally known as Flat Rock, was the son of Richard Levering, the man who had purchased the land from Penn. The town really grew, however, with the construction of a dam, canal, and locks by the Schuylkill Navigation Company. The canal provided water power for mills and other businesses and once it was in place, the Manayunk neighborhood began to grow in leaps and bounds and soon became a prosperous manufacturing area. During much of the 19th century, Manayunk contributed to Philadelphia's reputation as the leading industrial city in the United States. Immigrants arrived in droves to work at the mills and other plants in the area. They came mostly from England, Ireland, Poland, Italy, and Germany. In addition, many of the city's African-Americans settled in the Manayunk area and were employed in the factories there. The melting pot of residents made Manayunk a very culturally diverse area, a tradition which still continues today and is made evident by the many signs in different languages that line Main Street and other parts of the community. In the 1990s, the hilly neighborhood of Manayunk enjoyed a regentrification of sorts after a decade or more of blight caused by the closure of mills and manufacturing plants. The process of reinvigorating the area began with the opening of some upscale restaurants. More followed and, today, the area is known as an excellent night life location where young adults enjoy bar hopping and visiting nightclubs and comedy venues. A total of about 30 eateries line both sides of Main Street. Aside from new establishments, still present are some of the best small ethnic eateries in the city, started by those same immigrants who arrived more than 100 years ago and carried on through the decades by family members. Shopping in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia is also a favorite pastime. Art galleries and home furnishing stores are quite popular as are boutique-type shops selling unique apparel. The shopping district stays quite busy on weekends, especially during the summer season. In addition, each year the neighborhood residents help to organize the Manayunk Arts Festival, the largest outdoor arts and crafts festival in the Delaware Valley, generally attracting some 250 artists and artisans as well as more than a quarter-of-a-million guests. The art portion of the festival is juried and includes some of the best regional and local artists in the Philadelphia area. This family-oriented event also offers children's activities and sidewalk food offerings presented by local restaurateurs. Manayunk is also know for its wall'', an incredibly steep stretch of road that is difficult to navigate in the snow but is an important part of an annual bike race where participants are made to challenge this tough stretch of road."
"The Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh is a Unique Art Museum","Pennsylvania","The Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh is a Unique Art Museum","	The Mattress Factory is a museum of contemporary art, located in Pittsburgh's North Side neighborhood. The museum opened in 1977 and is one of only a few of its kind in the world. What makes the Mattress Factory unique is the fact that all the artworks featured within are room-sized pieces known as installations.'' Because of their size, the installations are created on site and designed specifically for the room in which they are to be displayed. Works are of a variety of media and are created by artists from all around the world. Some exhibitions change throughout the year. Others have become part of the Mattress Factory's permanent collection and include installations by James Turrell, Yayoi Kusama, Winifred Lutz and Rolf Julius, well known names in the field of contemporary art. Since the museum opened, it has sponsored a world-renowned residency program. To date, more than 300 artists have taken part in this residency program. As an artist in residence, each has the opportunity to come to Pittsburgh, live at the museum, and create new works, often experimenting with a number of different kinds of media. Artists are encouraged to experiment and take risks with their work while the museum supports them completely. Each year, dozens vie for the opportunity to be a part of this innovative residency program. Thus far, 72 percent of the 300+ artists have been from The United States, 11 percent from Europe, 9 percent from Asia and 8 percent from the Americas (excluding the U.S.). Residencies range from one week to two months with an average stay of about three to four weeks. All of the exhibitions at the Mattress Factory are paired with educational programs that are offered to museum visitors, both artists and non-artists. These activities include workshops, lectures, tours, and hands-on art projects. Classes emphasize the connection between art and one's everyday life. The education department at the museum serves approximately 16,000 people each year. The other unique thing about the Mattress Factory Art Museum is its location. Because of the size of the installations, the museum needs to be large with wide open spaces. Since it opened in 1977, the Mattress Factory, a non-profit organization, has purchased and renovated nine inner city Pittsburgh properties. These properties serve not only as exhibition space but also artists' residences, an artist-created garden, public spaces, classrooms, office space, visitor amenities, and a parking lot. An estimated 38,000 guests visit the Mattress Factory Art Museum each year. Nearly two-thirds of those visitors hail from the Pittsburgh area and dub themselves frequent visitors. About 34 percent come from other parts of the U.S. and another 5 percent from other countries around the world. The Mattress Factory can be rented for special events including wedding and corporate receptions. There is a museum gift shop on site as well as a caf, that offers outdoor dining when the weather is pleasant. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday and a small fee is charged for admission."

"The Mount Washington Neighborhood in Pittsburgh Provides Great Views of the City","Pennsylvania","The Mount Washington Neighborhood in Pittsburgh Provides Great Views of the City","	Mount Washington is a hilltop neighborhood in Pittsburgh, named after George Washington, who came to the area to survey it in hopes of avoiding a French invasion during the French and Indian War. The neighborhood is in the South City area of Pittsburgh and is served by the Monongahela and Duquesne Inclines, two remaining Pittsburgh inclines that take residents back and forth from high elevation neighborhoods to the downtown area below. The area now known as Mt. Washington was originally known as Coal Hill as many coal mines operated near the base of the mountain. In 1876, the name was officially changed. The area was settled mostly by German immigrants, who would walk up and down the steep footpaths to and from their homes each day. The trek was tiresome and the immigrants, who worked in various industries in the river valley below, proposed the building of an incline like the ones they had ridden at home. The Monongahela Incline was thus built in 1869-1870, the first of about 20 that were to be built throughout the city. Three other Mount Washington inclines were eventually constructed including the Duquesne Incline, which is also still open. The inclines of old also carried light freight as well as horses and small carriages up and down the mountain. Today, the Monongahela and Duquesne Inclines still serve residents going back and forth to work as well as tourists making their way to the top of the Mount Washington neighborhood to enjoy the excellent view of Pittsburgh. But many people who don't live at the top of Mt. Washington also make the trek up the 400-foot slopes to enjoy the dining, shopping, and other attractions there. Guests can stroll along Grandview Avenue along the cliffsides, where they can appreciate excellent vistas. These stretch of road and its scenic outlooks are a popular place for wedding photos and in the pleasant weather, it's not unusual to see a number of bridal parties riding the inclines to get to the top. Many locals and visitors also choose to dine along the neighborhood's renowned Restaurant Row, where eateries of many different varieties are available. Similarly, the Shiloh Street business district features shops, services, and more and is attractive to both locals and visitors. Also at the top of the Mount Washington hill is the 2007-built Grand View Scenic Byway Park, a 280-acre oasis encircling Mount Washington and Duquesne Heights, offering plenty of open space to residents of the Mount and other surrounding neighborhoods. Plans to add biking and hiking trails connecting this and other city parks are in the works and should be completed within the next few years. While Mount Washington was once home to the city's poorest immigrants, today its real estate is much more desirable and can be quite costly. Of particular interest are the Queen Anne-style Victorian homes that sit along pretty Grandview Avenue."
"The Mutter Museum in Philadelphia is one of the U.S.'s Strangest Museums","Pennsylvania","The Mutter Museum in Philadelphia is one of the U.S.'s Strangest Museums","	The Mutter Museum, part of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, is a macabre museum that was originally founded to help educate future doctors about anatomy and human medical anomalies. Since its inception in 1858, the museum has become a unique tribute to the mysteries of the medical world and the human body and is favored by visitors who don't mind viewing some of the strangest and most disgusting artifacts ever to be found in a museum. The Mutter Museum, located in Center City Philadelphia, got its start when Dr. Thomas Dent Mütter, retired Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College, presented his personal collection of unique anatomic and pathological materials'' to The College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Since that time, others have added to the permanent collection, which now numbers more than 20,000 objects. The collection includes photographs, prints, medical illustrations, memorabilia of famous doctors and researchers, and portraits, as well as more tangible objects such as fluid-preserved pathological specimens, dried specimens, skeletal remains, and ancient medical instruments that would frighten today's modern-day hospital patient. Guests visiting the museum will make their way through a variety of rooms and galleries. The first, the Mutter Room, contains a replica of the office of early 20th century Philadelphia physician, Dr. Philip Gordon Kitchen. Visitors can view his desk, examining table, supplies, instruments, and more. Also in the same room is an exhibit outlining the lives of various U.S. presidents and their health issues. In addition, the Mutter Room is home to a 1949-era iron lung and an interesting exhibit on the fight against polio. The Upper Gallery contains a collection of 19th century wax models of skin diseases and skulls and bones that were ravaged by syphilis, a disease that was once treated by dermatologists. Also in this gallery is one of the Mutter Museum's most famous exhibits, The Soap Lady. She is so named because after her burial in a local cemetery, the fat of her body turned to a lye soap-like substance, a phenomenon never before witnessed. The Upper Gallery also houses a collection of 139 skulls, a gangrenous hand, and the compressed ribcage of a woman who was the constant wearer of a corset. Another exhibit tells the history of medical museums in American while yet another describes the development of forensic sciences. A fascinating exhibit just outside the gallery tells the story of co-joined twins through the centuries and includes information on original Siamese Twins, Chang and Eng, whose autopsy was performed at the museum in the late 19th century. The Lower Gallery of the Mutter Museum is divided into four areas: Normal and Abnormal Fetal Development, including a plaster cast of Chang and Eng; Internal Medicine, which includes specimens of heart, lungs, lymphatic and urinary systems and objects such as bladder stones and tumors; Disorders of the Skeletal System, focusing on abnormalities including giants and dwarfism; and the Neurology Section, which contains a series of sliced sections of the human head, made especially for the Mutter Museum in 1910. The museum is open daily year round except on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day. There is a fee to enter. No photographs are allowed to be taken inside the Mutter Museum, which is easily reachable on foot from most of the historic areas or can be accessed via Philadelphia's vast public transportation system."

The Apple Festival began in 1961 as the First Apple Harvest Holiday.'' It was organized by the Adams County Fruitgrowers Association, an organization that had been running Apple Blossom Festivals since the 1950s. The first event was just a day long. By 1965, the newly-formed Adams County Jaycees got involved, the name of the event was changed, and the first official National Apple Harvest Festival happened in 1965. Events included an antique car show, pony rides, orchard bus tours, apple cider making, and sales of all sorts of apple-related products. In addition, an Apple Blossom Queen was crowned and a traditional Dutch meal was served.

"The Old City Arts District of Philadelphia is Bucolic Example of Urban Renewal","Pennsylvania","The Old City Arts District of Philadelphia is Bucolic Example of Urban Renewal","	The Old City Arts District of Philadelphia is a neighborhood in the downtown area, situated near the Delaware River and just a few blocks from the city's popular historic district. It is generally described as the area between Front Street and Sixth Street to the east and west and Vine St. and Walnut St. on the north and south. It is characterized by charming renovated row homes, cobblestone streets, and a wealth of galleries, restaurants, and nightlife locations. The Old City Art Association refers to this area as Hipstoric'', a combination of trendy and historic. Like much of Philadelphia in the 1970s, the area known as Old City had become quite run down, with large numbers of vacant buildings, homes, and businesses, dotting what had once been a grand landscape of beautiful colonial buildings. Warehouses and light industry also gave the area a less than bucolic look. In one of the best urban regentrification programs to happen in the city of Philadelphia, however, this historic area improved bit by bit as residents interested in preserving its historical integrity arrived to purchase dilapidated homes and turn them into showpieces. As a matter of fact, the area was the fastest growing neighborhood in Philadelphia from 1970 to 2000, increasing in population by about 1000 percent. Artists who were looking for cheap studio space quickly grabbed up the warehouses as well, and turned them into studios, galleries, or homes, or all three. The fact that area is also home to seven of the 20 most visited sites in Philadelphia - including Franklin Court, the U.S. Mint, Elfreth's Alley, and Christ Church - have also helped to cement Old City's reputation as a favored neighborhood. Today, interspersed with that history are mom-and-pop shops, boutiques, bistros, coffee shops, and still the occasional machine shop or other light industrial operation. The Old City Arts District, especially after dark, is a favorite destination of young professionals, especially those in their 20s and 30s. An estimated 100 bars and restaurants are located within the neighborhood's boundaries, offering food of a variety of cultures and plenty of live music and dancing, especially on weekend evenings. Some of the city's top-rated restaurants are here, attracting not only city residents but also foodies who come in from the suburbs just to enjoy a fine meal in a vibrant urban atmosphere. Shopping is equally as top-notch in the Old City Arts District. Art lovers will be thrilled with the eclectic collection of galleries here, offering everything from traditional oils and watercolors to cutting edge modern art for the collector of contemporary pieces. Visitors will also find handmade jewelry and other craft-type items designed by some of the city's best artisans. In addition to galleries, visitors will also find clothing stores, gift shops, and much more. Service-oriented establishments are also numerous, including salons, spas, medical buildings, real estate offices, and much more. Homes in the Old City Arts District are quite costly, even those that require some renovation.

It is located between 11th and 33rd streets along the southern shore and the Strip's historic market district runs from 16th to 22nd streets. The neighborhood was established in 1814 as the Northern Liberties of Pittsburgh and because it was situated along the river, it became a growing industrial portion of the city, quickly filling up with foundries, iron mills, and glass factories. Many immigrants arrived to work in those factories and mills, mostly from Germany, Ireland, and Poland. The Strip - a name given to the area by locals - also became a prime area for the wholesale food and produce industry. Grocers lined the streets and independent grocery store and restaurant owners visited daily to choose the best of the best when it came to meat, poultry, seafood, fruits, and vegetables. The 1950s and the advent of chain food stores caused The Strip District to change, but many of the vendors stayed and their descendants still remain today, peddling their foodstuffs to customers who are interested in buying the freshest and best. From the early years of the 20th century, The Strip was also the location for some of the area's best diners. Many of them still remain, once serving the truck traffic that made their way through the wholesale area but now serving local residents and tourists. Today, this area, just north of downtown, is still known for its great food and, in addition, its nightlife opportunities. Many of the old warehouses that once housed factories and other industrial businesses have been converted to loft-style residents and are quite popular with artists and others looking for spacious living accommodations at a good price.

"Valley Forge National Historic Park - Valley Forge, Pennsylvania historical park and training area for Revolutionary War soldiers","Pennsylvania","Valley Forge National Historic Park - Valley Forge, Pennsylvania historical park and training area for Revolutionary War soldiers","Valley Forge National Historic Park, located in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is owned by the people of the United States and operated by the National Park Service. The site of George Washington's headquarters, it commemorates the spirit and courage of the Continental Army during the fight for independence in the Revolutionary War. The park offers a wealth of activities for families and individuals, both indoors and out. The activities run the gamut from historical tours to hands-on nature and science activities. Among the featured activities are a Trolley Tour, cell phone tours, and the opportunity for younger visitors to enlist in the Continental Army and enjoy monthly training sessions''. Valley Forge was chosen as a winter base camp and training camp for the Continental Army in 1777. Washington's choice of Valley Forge as a base camp was a deliberate strategic decision - it was close enough to the cities for the army to continue a campaign meant to dislodge the British from their hold, but far enough away to prevent surprise attacks. Despite the popular image of the soldiers who gathered at Valley Forge as a downtrodden, starving group of ragtag volunteers, contemporary accounts of visits to the camp tell a different story. In the course of a few months, the army at Valley Forge built a small city with over 2,000 small log huts for their own lodgings as well as miles of trenches, earthen forts and a bridge over the Schuylkill River. While supplies were not plentiful, they were available, and contrary to the popular folklore it was not hunger and cold that decimated the Army, but disease. From 1777 onward, Valley Forge functioned as a main training camp for recruits to the Continental Army from all 13 colonies. In 1893, the Valley Forge Park Commission was successful in having Valley Forge established as the first state park in Pennsylvania. Its stated purpose was to preserve, improve, and maintain as a public park the site on which General George Washington's army encamped at Valley Forge''. Valley Forge operated as a state park until 1976, when the state of Pennsylvania gave the site to the United States as a gift to commemorate the Bicentennial. On July 4, 1976, President Gerald Ford signed a law that authorized the addition of Valley Forge National Historical Park to the National Parks System. Valley Forge sits on 3,500 acres of land about 25 miles outside of Philadelphia. In addition to the Welcome Center and restored historical structures, the park features 26 miles of hiking and biking trails. The park grounds are open daily year round from 6 am to 10 pm. The Visitors' Center is open daily except Christmas and Thanksgiving from 9 am to 5 pm.

"Wachovia Center","Pennsylvania","Wachovia Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Located beside the Wachovia Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is the Wachovia Center. The Wachovia Spectrum was built in the 60's, and will be closing in October 2009. The Wachovia Center on the other hand is fairly new. It is not going to interfere with the Philly Live! Complex. The center was opened in 1996, after two years of construction. It is owned by the same owners of the Spectrum, Comcast Spectator and operated by Global Spectrum. The arena was first named Spectrum II, but naming rights have been sold a few times, until Wachovia got a hold of them. From 2004 to 2008 the Wachovia Center was home to the Philadelphia Soul AFL team. It is still home to the Philadelphia flyers, 76ers, and Wings. The facility was first opened as a home for the NHL Flyers. Since it was large enough to accommodate the other teams it has also been used by them. The construction costs totaled to $210 million. Wachovia has struggled in the subprime mortgage crisis. It struggled so much that Wells Fargo eventually won against Citi Bank to take over the Wachovia banks. The merger has yet to be fully complete, but once the integration is finished the Spectrum will carry the Wells Fargo name. Wells Fargo already has two arenas, one in Arizona and a second in Iowa that carries its name. The indoor arena provides 21,600 seats for basketball and only 19,500 for hockey. There are 126 luxury suites with 1880 club seats at the facility. Also on site are restaurants at the public and private levels for all patrons. Some of the restaurants are for club ticket holders only. Over the years the Flyers have hosted games against the Detroit Red Wings. They even won the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Red Wings. College basketball has also had a few tournaments and games at the arena. In 2006 Comcast announced a new center hung scoreboard. It was created by ANC Sports. There is a liner LED display with plenty of screens going around it for playback. There are also a number of HDTV's spread throughout the concourses and restaurants so ticket holders will not miss a moment of the games. The arena caters to more than sports. The Wachovia Center opened with Oasis, Manic Street Preachers, and Screaming Trees. The crowd was about 12,000 large. Guns N' Roses, The Grateful Dead, AC/ DC, Aerosmith, Christian Aguilera, Alice In Chains, Miley Cyrus, Green Day, Janet Jackson, and Phil Collins are just a few of the artists who have had concerts at the center. Others include Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, ColdPlay, New Kids on the Block, Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Barbra Streisand, The Who, Justin Timberlake, Yanni, Stevie Wonder, and George Michael. Metallica also appeared at the Wachovia Arena With performances comes the need for food. Concessions will range from local favorites such as Philly Steaks to popcorn, hot dogs, cotton candy, hamburger and more. Beverages like soda and beer are also provided, among other typical drinks."
"Wachovia Spectrum","Pennsylvania","Wachovia Spectrum, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","The Wachovia Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has gone by many names since it was officially opened in 1967. It has been called the Spectrum, Core States Spectrum, and the First Union Spectrum. Wachovia did buy the naming rights for a couple of years, but the bank is now defunct. Wells Fargo had to purchase Wachovia due to the recent financial troubles the bank had. It could no longer sustain itself without becoming a subsidiary of the larger bank. The Spectrum can seat up to 18,000 visitors for basketball, 17,300 for hockey and other sports. At the moment the center is home to the Philadelphia Phantoms and Philadelphia KiXX. Over the forty plus years the facility has been open there have been other teams that called the arena home. The Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Wings, Philadelphia Soul, Philadelphia Freedoms, Philadelphia Bulldogs, and Philadelphia Fever used to call the arena home. Comcast Spectacor is the owner of the facility with Global Spectrum running the place. The construction costs were $7 million. Despite the teams calling the arena home they are soon to be into a new home. On October 31, 2009 the center will be closed. This is after a four day Pearl Jam Concert. The center is to be closed and razed. The proposal is to build a new hotel as part of the Philly Live! Complex. In the early years the sports complex was used for the NHL team and as an Ice Capades facility. In 1968 during one of the ice shows the roof collapsed and the center had to be closed. There was a small battle to get the roof replaced while the Mayor fought with DA Arlen Specter about who should fix the roof. Several All Star Games also made their way to the facility. The Stanley Cup was won at the arena in the 70's. College Basketball Tournaments such as the Big Five games, eight Atlantic Ten Conference Tournaments, and the Final Fours were held at the facility. Wachovia Spectrum had some wrestling tournaments with the WWF and WWE. Many of the performances were live telecasts for the public to enjoy like the Summer Slam, King of the Ring, and Hulk Hogan tournaments. Also, the WCW was promoted at the arena. By far the most prolific of events has been musical artists holding concerts at the arena. The Doors, Greatful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Aerosmith, Pink Floyd, Animals in the Flesh, Roger Waters, Us and Them, and Queen have visited the complex. The Who, Guns N' Roses, We Can't Dance, Phil Collins, Genesis, Use Your Illusion Tour, Dio, Kiss, Phish, and Unforgettable Five Tour were other events. The announcement to close the Spectrum Arena came in July 2008. Chairman Ed Snider announced that the land was going to be needed for the Philly Live! Complex which would offer a larger building for the hockey and soccer events. To commemorate the Spectrum the teams were given one more year to play against US teams along with several concert performances"

"Weyerbacher Brewing Company","Pennsylvania","Weyerbacher Brewing Company - Easton, Pennsylvania - beer manufacturing factory and tour","The Weyerbacher Brewing Company is a working brewery located at 905 Line Street in Easton, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1995 by avid home brew enthusiast Dan Weirbach and his wife Sue, the facility offers brewery tours and special sales on Saturdays throughout the year. Weyerbacher ales and beers are well-regarded specialty brews in the micro-brewery world, and the tour and sample tasting is a popular activity for both visitors and area residents. The Weyerbacher Brewery originally opened in 1995 at 20 S. Sixth Street in Easton. The building once served as a livery stable, and despite its colorful history, presented numerous space and logistics problems for the Weirbachs. Even so, the brewery quickly made a name for itself as a quality microbrewery bottling unusual stouts and ales. While Weirbach's original plan had been to make and market mainstream American beers and ales, his own tastes and love of experimentation led him to create specialty ales like raspberry Imperial stout and pale Indian ale. His experimentation coincided with the surging interest in microbrewed beers, and the company launch was extremely successful. In 1997, the Weirbachs decided to expand their business by adding a brew pub. While the pub was popular and successful, the couple found that trying to run two successful businesses put a strain on their small company. In 2001, when the brewery was moved to its current, more spacious location, they made the decision to close the brew pub and focus on brewing. Weyerbacher brews are well-known among the aficionados of microbrewed beers. Weirbach pioneered a method of aging beers and stouts in oak barrels that had previously been used to age bourbon. The practice imparts a unique flavor and complexity to the brews that is highly regarded and well-known. Weirbach has also experimented with growing his own hops for an limited edition ale in 2008, and plans to repeat and possibly expand the experiment. Weyerbacher beers and ales are available locally and in a number of nearby states, and can be purchased at the brewery itself during the Saturday brewery tours. The Weyerbacher Brewing Company is open on Saturdays for public tours and sampling. The fifteen minute tour takes visitors through the brewery, offering a brief but thorough overview of the brewing process for the company's signature brews. After the tour, visitors are encouraged to sample signature Weyerbacher ales and beers, both those on tap and bottled. Brewery employees will happily open a bottle of any ale in stock for visitors to sample. Visitors can buy ales by the bottle, case, keg or growler, and are encouraged to put together mixed cases of different brews. There is also a gift store on premises where visitors can purchase merchandise with the company logo. Tours of the Weyerbacher Brewing Company are conducted every Saturday at 12:30pm, 1:15pm and 2:15pm, with a sampling period following the fifteen minute tour.

"Wheatland in Lancaster was President James Buchanan's Favored Home","Pennsylvania","Wheatland in Lancaster was President James Buchanan's Favored Home","	Wheatland is the name of an historic estate in the city of Lancaster in central Pennsylvania. The mansion was once home to James Buchanan, the 15th President of the United States. Portions of it are open to the public for touring. Wheatland, a Federal-style home, was originally built in 1828 by lawyer, William Jenkins. It was later owned by another lawyer, William Morris Meredith from Philadelphia, and was then purchased by Buchanan in 1848, about a decade before he assumed the presidency. Buchanan, who was a Pennsylvania native, purchased a total of about 22 acres, which included not only the mansion but also several outbuildings. He ran his presidential campaign from the home he loved and he lived at Wheatland until his death in 1868. His niece, Harriet Lane Johnston, inherited the property and eventually sold it to Lancaster businessman George Wilson, who sold off 13 acres and left the remainder to his cousin when he died in 1934. A year later, the James Buchanan Foundation for the Preservation of Wheatland was formed and the foundation purchased the remaining property (about 4 acres) in 1936. The Wheatland mansion is a National Historic Landmark and much of it has been renovated to reflect life during the Civil War era and beyond, particularly the years during Buchanan's occupancy. Today, visitors can view the mansion as well as the outbuildings, which include the carriage house (which functions as a Visitor Center), the privy, and the smoke-ice house. The privy was one of the original buildings on the property and was used until the late 1800s when indoor plumbing was added. The smokehouse-icehouse included three levels for storing and curing food - meats on the top floor, produce on the ground level, and ice in the basement. The carriage house was most likely built by George Wilson and was used to store his carriages. A separate stable, no longer standing, was used for his horses. There are two exhibition gardens surrounding the mansion. Guests can tour them and learn about the vegetables and herbs that were grown here during the nineteenth century. Visitors to Wheatland can take advantage of daily guided tours, which last about an hour and depart from the Visitor Center. Tickets can be purchased there as well. The attraction has limited accessibility for wheelchair-bound visitors but printed scripts of the tour are available for the hearing impaired. Groups of 10 of more people are welcome to tour together. Reservations should be made in advance. Costumed docents lead the group tours. Wheatland and the James Buchanan Foundation offer a number of special events each year. These include days to mark President Buchanan's birthday as well as food and arts festivals, holiday tours, garden club sales, and more. President James Buchanan's Wheatland is open Tuesday through Saturday from April through October, weekends in November and December, and by appointment only from January through March.

It is a haven for many species of flora and fauna, with special events, nature trails and scenic views offered to visitors. The sanctuary is open daily from dawn until dusk, whilst the nature center is open each day except Mondays from 10am to 4pm. The park surrounds the Wildwood Lake and has been in operation for over a century, although it began life as Wetzel's Swamp. Land for the park was acquired between 1905 and 1913 with its first paths opening in 1907, a baseball field created in 1908 and a boating concession starting in 1909. Over the next few decades in the early part of the 20th century a zoo and riding stables were added, but these closed some time in the 1940s. The importance of Wildwood was recognized in the late 1980s when the rare American lotus was discovered there, and this helped the progression of a park rebuild. Food distribution king Benjamin Olewine III donated $827,000 towards the creation of the park's $4.2 million nature center, which opened in 1999. Wildwood Lake Sanctuary is now one of premier centers for environmental and ecological nature studies, educational opportunities and outdoor recreation in the state. The nature center takes the name of Benjamin Olewine III in recognition of his large financial contribution to the project. It is a 12,000-square-foot educational facility with modern green-building technology and is used to study the wetlands and aquatic life. Ideal for school or family trips it also contains classrooms, bird viewing decks, offices, a nature shop, a library, exhibit areas, a laboratory and a weather station. The park has many places to observe wild flowers, insects and birds and is an ideal area for taking photographs. The lake is a good place for bird watchers, and there are many different trails for visitors to follow alongside the lake with varying degrees of difficulty. One of the easier trails is the Towpath Trail, which is only a mile long but gives views of wetland birds, songbirds and turtles. Six other trails at the park give visitors the chance to see many more birds and flowers, one of which is the Fox Run Trail where staff hope the bog land will be a good breeding area for frogs and salamanders. Other animals at the park to be seen are skunks and garter snakes in summer or Whitetail deer in fall. Red fox, gray squirrels and groundhog can be found in winter, with tree frogs and turtles inhabiting the park during spring. School programs are offered here too with the opportunity to observe 229 acres of shallow lake, swamp, riparian areas, field, forest and 6 miles of trails to explore.

While the cliff rises over one thousand feet above sea level, the cliff stands only five hundred feet above the banks of the Susquehanna River. Wyalusing Rocks has been a lookout point since the valley was originally settled. Historically, it was an important signaling point for Iroquois, a Native American tribe. It was once a sacred spot to the Native Americans residing in the area. Today, it provides an incredible view of the forests and farms in the area. There is a footpath that leads from the parking area to the rocks themselves. Wyalusing Rocks is especially popular in the fall because it provides a nice vantage point for seeing the leaves changing their colors. In addition, bird-watching is popular, and visitors can see migrating raptors in the area. Visitors are welcome to bring cameras, binoculars, and even lawn chairs in order to enjoy the view. The view provides visitors with a panorama of Terry Township's rolling farmland, which is bordered by the Susquehanna River. There is also a railroad in the area that was built on the North Branch Canal's tow path. Especially known for its picturesque sunset view, visitors can typically photograph the migrating birds as the sun goes down.

"ZooAmerica","Pennsylvania","ZooAmerica - Hershey, Pennsylvania - small private wildlife area and amusement park","ZooAmerica is a small wildlife area located next to Hershey Park, an amusement park in Hershey, Pennsylvania. ZooAmerica began life as a private animal collection owned by Franz and Louise Zinner. The couple owned a dozen prairie dogs and a bear cub, which they knew they could not keep in their yard. In 1905, the Zinners met with confectioner Milton Hershey to work out an agreement with him to house the animals as part of the new park he was building for the town. Over the early years, the Hershey Zoo grew through private acquisitions. By 1910, the zoo's collection included goats, bears, zebus, pheasants, peacocks, deer and several different kinds of monkeys. During that decade, the zoo added individual houses for monkeys, birds, reptiles, antelopes and fish. The Zoo has closed for several periods during its history. In 1942, Hershey Zoo closed for the duration of the war because of a shortage of zookeepers. The zoo closed again in 1971 when Hershey Park decided to move to a single price admission scheme for its amusement park and rides. ZooAmerica opened in 1978 as a natural habitat featuring animals native to North America. The animal exhibits are arranged by region, with biomes devoted to the Southern Swamps, the Northlands, the Great Southwest, the Eastern Woodlands and Big Sky Country. The animals at the zoo are all native to North America, but that doesn't mean that the zoo is boring or uninventive. May of the animals cannot be easily seen in the wild and are extremely rare. Visitors to the zoo can spend time with alligators, crocodiles, black bears, barn owls, blue spiny lizards, and coatis. They also have a featured animal every month, and visitors can learn more about this animal during this month. In addition to the exhibits, Hershey Park cooperates with local schools to create educational programs for children and offers daily animal encounters'' for visitors. Area children can also take part in Summer Zoo Camp and other activities. They offer after-hours tours and programs for people who want a special zoo experience.
