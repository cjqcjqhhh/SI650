"American Museum of Magic","Michigan","American Museum of Magic - Marshall, MI - museum celebrating the history of magic as entertainment","Robert Lund, who was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1925, spent his lifetime collecting and preserving magic memorabilia. Today, his collection is housed in the American Museum of Magic, the largest privately owned museum of its kind. Located half way between Chicago and Detroit in Marshall, Michigan, the American Museum of Magic plays host to thousands of visitors every year. Unlike other museums, the American Museum of Magic is devoted to the entertainment side of magic, not the occult or religious magic. Nearly one million items, some hundreds of year old, call this museum home, and although preference is to American magicians, the collection includes artifacts and information on magic from around the world. Some of the items visitors can find here include artwork, costumes, props, letters, and personal items belonging to some of the world's most famous magicians. The American Museum of Magic is home to a library of over 15,000 books and periodicals relating to magic. Along with biographies and writings of some well-known names in the world of magic, the museum also has an archive filled with information on little-known magicians. In additions, visitors can find thousands of books explaining how to perform magic tricks. Near the library is the Irving Desfor collection, which includes over 20,000 photographs dating back to the 16th century as well as including modern magic photography. One of the most popular exhibits in the American Museum of Magic celebrates the life of Harry Houdini, arguably the world's most famous magician of all. The museum houses the original Milk Can and Overboard Box equipment, used for some of this magician's most popular tricks. Other popular exhibits include Harry Blackston's Jam Illusions box, stage outfits worn by Milky the Clown and Senor Rey, one of Jay Marshall's ventriloquist dummies, and a French scroll that once belongs to Jean-Eugene Robert-Houdin. Lund also collected items from lesser-known magicians and rare magic-related memorabilia, such as original Mandrake comics, posters and banners for strangely-named performers, and a Marshall Brodini magic set, one of only 500 ever made. The American Museum of Magic was first open to the public in the 1970s, when Lund and his wife, Elaine, moved to Marshall and bought a three-story building to house the collection. In 1999, Elaine expanded the museum's space to display even more items in what was once the town's old library. Even with this additional room, there are still thousands of items in storage waiting to be displayed. Lund passed away in 1995, and his wife established a board of directors and a volunteer staff to help her keep the museum running. She passed away in 2006, and today, the museum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization fully run by the board. They are open only by appointment, and tourists can call 269-781-7570 to set a time to see the collection for a minimal fee of $5 for adults and $3.50 for children. They also have group rates available. Marshall is located near Colon, Michigan, which has been christened the Magic Capital of the World,'' as the home of Abbott's Magic Company and the an annual magic festival."

"Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory","Michigan","Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory - Detroit, Michigan - 13-acre garden with greenhouse on Belle Isle","The Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is a 13-acre botanical garden with greenhouse located on Belle Isle in downtown Detroit, Michigan. Built in 1904, it is the oldest conservatory in the country. Designed by Albert Kahn, a well-known architect, the original conservatory was rebuilt between 1952 to 1954. At that point the building, which had been made of wood, was given a new skeleton of steel and other metal. In 1953, the Conservatory was renamed for Anna Scripps Whitcomb, a Detroit native who bequeathed her collection of 600 orchid plants to the city. With Whitcomb's gift and other generous donations, the Anna Cripps Whitcomb Conservatory now houses one of the largest and most varied collections of orchids in the United States. In fact, the reputation of the Whitcomb Conservatory was so well-known that during World War II, rare orchid specimens that were rescued from the bombing in Great Britain were taken to the conservatory for preservation. The greenhouse that houses the orchid collection, which is owned by the city of Detroit, is set in a 13-acre botanical garden. The conservatory takes up more than an acre of the gardens, and includes two wings and a separate house. One wing houses tropical plants like bananas, coffee, orchids, and oranges. The opposite wing houses an extensive collection of desert plants, including cacti, succulents and ferns. The central dome, which is 85 feet high, contains a show house which features a display of flowering plants. In addition to the conservatory itself, the grounds include formal gardens of perennials, a lily pond garden and a formal rose garden. The gardens and grounds are a popular venue for weddings and events, and attracts professional and amateur photographers from around the area. While the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory is owned and operated by the city of Detroit, the Belle Isle Botanical Society is one of its strongest supporters. Founded in 1988, the BIBS is dedicated to preserving and providing ongoing maintenance and renovation at the Conservatory. It works with the city to raise funds and make necessary renovations and repairs. Since 2005, BIBS has managed to raise the money needed to replace or repair all the glass in the conservatory and the greenhouse. Belle Isle Park, home to the Conservatory, is the largest island park in the country, and is larger than Central Park. It is located in the middle of the Detroit River, and connected to the city by MacArthur Bridge. In addition to the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, Belle Isle is also home to the Detroit Yacht Club, a Nature Center, the Detroit Boat Club, a swimming beach, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum and a municipal golf course. The park was designed and landscaped in the 1880s by renowned park architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed the Arnold Arboretum, Central Park and the grounds of the United States Capital. The Conservatory is open 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, including holidays, and admission is free. For information on hours, admission or to book events at the Conservatory, contact the Conservatory directly at (313) 628-2081, or via TTY at (313) 224-4636."
"Arcadia Bluffs Golf Club","Michigan","Arcadia Bluffs Golf Club, Arcadia, Michigan - One of the Most Visually Appealing Golf Destinations in the Country","Arcadia Bluffs Golf Club opened in 1999 as a daily-fee course and, despite its location off the beaten path in Northern Michigan, it has received raves as one of the most visually appealing golf courses in the country - perhaps even the world. The links-style course is carved out of 245 acres of windswept land atop the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan. From its highest point, the course drops 225 feet, and also features 3,100 feet of shore frontage along the lake. It's been argued that Arcadia Bluffs is not a true links-style course, but more of a seaside links course that features rolling terrain and windswept fescue grasses. Designed by the team of Warren Henderson and Rick Smith, the course is said to evoke memories of courses such as Lahinch and Ballybunion, while contributing some breathtaking views. The par-72/73, 18-hole course plays to 7,300 yards from the championship tees, and a more manageable 6,702 from the Black tees, with a USGA rating of 72.8 and a slope rating of 147. The course features some of the widest fairways golfers will ever find on a challenging course, along with 120 total bunkers, including 50 sod-walled bunkers, lots of native grasses, and large greens that average 8,000 square feet. The real challenge of this course tends to show up from 50 yards on in, with greens that are very undulating and sod-wall bunkers that can be so deep that they make the famous road hole'' bunker in Scotland look tame by comparison. In addition, the terrain is not flat and it's often a challenge to find a level lie. And there are also the wind off Lake Michigan to contend with, which, depending on which way it's blowing, can make club selection another challenge. Like some of the European links courses, which have been described at times as quirky,'' Arcadia Bluffs follows a similar non-traditional routing on the front nine. The course begins with a par-5 hole that plays to 519 yards from the longest tees, and ends with a lengthy par-3 of 203 yards from the Championship tees and 176 yards from the Blacks. The par-5 11th hole is particularly scenic and challenging. The hole plays downhill but to a hefty 633 yards from the back tees, and a respectable 594 from the Blacks. The fairway narrows dramatically once past the landing area, and golfers will often have to contend with an incoming wind as the hole plays directly down toward the water. Another noteworthy hole, and one of the most difficult par-3s on the course is the 13th. The hole plays dramatically downhill and has a forced carry over rugged rough to a green set against the backdrop of Lake Michigan. The winds and the perception that this hole is longer than it looks will have many tees shots finding either the deep bunker in front or the dramatic slopes to the left. GPS-equipped golf carts are available, as well as a caddy program, to assist golfers with distance and club selection. The course has received some prestigious awards, including being ranked #10 by Golf Digest among the Top 100 Public Courses, 2009-2010, and a #7 ranking in 2008 from Golf World Magazine among the Top 50 Public Courses. Practice facilities include a full range and separate short-game facility. There's also a Nantucket, coastal estate-style clubhouse with breathtaking views of the course and Lake Michigan, as well as a Golf Shop and the Restaurant at Arcadia Bluffs for full-service dining."
"Arch Rock, Mackinac Island, Michigan, a Natural Limestone Formation and Source of Myth Overlooking the Straits of Mackinac","Michigan","Arch Rock, Mackinac Island, Michigan, a Natural Limestone Formation and Source of Myth Overlooking the Straits of Mackinac","Arch Rock is a natural limestone formation on the shoreline of Lake Huron that stands 146 above the water. The arch is believed to have formed during the Nipissing post-glacial period, when water levels in Lake Huron were high following the end of the glaciation in Wisconsin. The limestone breccia formation is quite rare in the Great Lakes region, although it is one of several such formations on Mackinac Island that include Sugar Loaf and Skull Cave. To the Native American Ottawa people, the rock is a source of legend and superstition, due in part because the rock appears from certain angles to be suspended in the air. One such legend attempts to explain the rock's mythical nature via an angry Master of Life. As the story goes, an Ottawa chieftain committed an act so shameful that the Master of Life was deeply offended by it. As the Ottawa people stood gazing at the sun one day, it changed to the color of blood and then plummeted from the sky. When the sun reached the earth, it crashed into the eastern shore of Mackinac Island with a terrifying sound. Once the frightened people dared to look upon the sight, it appeared as though the sun had hollowed out some of the rocks so as to form an arch, suspended above the lake. That may be why the arch is believed to be a bridge over which departed souls pass on the way to their final resting place. Even today, the bravest of the Ottawa people will not walk over it or even dare come near it. Early Euro-American settlers did not share in such superstitious beliefs, but did treat the arch as something to be admired. Its presence was a key factor in the decision to create the Mackinac Island National Park in 1875, and its successor, Mackinac Island State Park, twenty years later. Arch Rock has been a focus of Mackinac Island tourism ever since. The Arch is reachable by taking Arch Rock Road, a dedicated road that leads from Fort Mackinac to the eastern shore of the island where the rock formation is found. The rock faces eastward overlooking the Straits of Mackinac, providing for some beautiful photo opportunities. For those desiring to get closer to the rock formation, a wooden stairway was built from the Lakeshore Road leading to the rock formation. And there are also a number of more rural trails that make their way across the island to Arch Rock."
"Bay Harbor Golf Club, The Links/Quarry Course, Bay Harbor, Michigan ? The ``King of Northern Michigan Golf,'' According to Golf Digest; The ``Pebble Beach of the Midwest'' According to GOLF Magazine","Michigan","Bay Harbor Golf Club, The Links/Quarry Course, Bay Harbor, Michigan ? The ``King of Northern Michigan Golf,'' According to Golf Digest; The ``Pebble Beach of the Midwest'' According to GOLF Magazine","The semi-private Bay Harbor Golf Club opened in 1998 and quickly moved to the top of the rankings for Michigan and national golf destinations. Built on the site of a former limestone quarry and cement factory along the shores of Lake Michigan and Little Traverse Bay, Bay Harbor is considered the crown jewel of Boyne USA's 172-hole golf empire. The Bay Harbor Golf Club consists of three, nine-hole courses, with The Links and The Quarry considered the most picturesque of the Arthur Hills designs. The Links Course plays to 3,432 yards, is more wide open,'' and never strays far from the shorelines of Lake Michigan and Little Traverse Bay. The layout is fashioned after the windswept shorelines typical of Scottish links-style golf courses, while providing golfers with some scenic views they'll never forget. The bunkers are not pot bunkers, per se, but the sand traps can still be deep and penalizing, while huge fairways are bordered by the customary entangling heather/gorse grasses. The Quarry Course is considered the most challenging of the three nines, and it was the site of the Shell's Wonderful World of Golf special challenge between Phil Mickelson and Tom Lehman. The course is cut from a former quarry and is said to be one of the unique and visually spectacular stages for golf you'll find anywhere.'' The course plays to 3,348 yards, with features such as 40-foot rock walls juxtaposed against lush, green fairways. It's been said that golfers must be wary of losing a ball at any turn, with eight tee shots and six of the nine approach shots requiring forced carries. One of the more noteworthy holes on The Links Course is hole No. 7, which has been described as the closest thing to Pebble Beach this side of the Rocky Mountains.'' This hole is situated on cliffs 150 feet above the waters of Lake Michigan, and the fairway winds back and forth until reaching a two-tiered green set against the cliffs. On The Quarry Course, every hole has been described as unique. But the finishing three holes all play toward the water and are some of the most scenic on the course. No. 7 features a forced carry off the tee to a fairway with a bunker at its center. No. 8 plays 172 yards downhill to a peninsula green bordered by Lake Michigan. And hole No. 9 runs along the cliffs above the water, with a fairway that drops 30-40 feet for a dramatic conclusion to the round. Since opening, the Bay Harbor Golf Club has received many accolades, including being ranked #8 among the Top 100 Courses in America'' by GOLF Magazine, and receiving a 5-Star rating from Golf Digest. It has also been called the King of Northern Michigan Golf,'' and The Pebble Beach of the Midwest'' by those same publications. Practice facilities include a driving range with several rows of hitting stations, along with several practice greens. A spacious clubhouse is home to a Pro Shop, along with dining options, such as Arthur's 27 for elegant dining, and the Links Grille for casual pub fare. The Preserve Room is also available for private dining."

"Belle Isle","Michigan","Belle Isle - Detroit, Michigan - island park and tourist attraction","Belle Isle is an island park in Detroit, Michigan. At just under 1,000 acres, it is the largest park in the country to cover a complete island, and this island is the third largest island in the Detroit River. The 2.42 square mile island is home to a number of recreational spots managed by the Detroit Recreation Department, including the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory and a small golf course. Belle Isle was originally colonized by French settlers in the 1700s and was at one point a private estate. Once known as Hog Island, the island got its current name in 1845. In the 1880s, at the height of the movement to beautify urban landscapes with formally planned parks, Belle Isle was landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted, a well-known urban landscaper, was also the designer of Central Park and the Arnold Arboretum in Boston. Between the time that the island was landscaped and the mid-1900s, a number of buildings and structures were added to the island. In 1887, architects John Donaldson and Henry Meier designed and built a Queen Anne style casino building on the west end of the island. When the casino was destroyed by fire, the city chose Albert Kahn to design its replacement. The Renaissance style brick and terra cotta building was built in 1908, and is still used for weddings and events today. Kahn also designed and built the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, the oldest public conservatory in the country. For years, Belle Isle was home to a herd of fallow deer, a children's zoo and an aquarium, but the city closed the animal facilities due to budget problems. The island still offers many recreational opportunities. Belle Isle is connected to the city of Detroit by the MacArthur Bridge. It is home to a number of leisure and entertainment amenities. They include the Detroit Botanical Gardens and the Anna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory, which houses one of the country's most extensive collections of orchids. In addition, it is home to the a yacht club, a boat club, a municipal golf course, a Coast Guard post, and the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. There is a half-mile long swimming beach, and a Nature Center, as well as several miles of hiking trails, including wheelchair accessible hiking trails. Visitors to the island can also take advantage of picnic tables, a playground, baseball fields, basketball courts and tennis courts. Finally, the island is the site of a street race circuit that hosts races in the IndyCar Series and the ALMS. The James Scott Fountain located on Belle Isle was designed by New York architect Cass Gilbert. The fountain was built in 1925 with a special bequest from infamous gambler, James Scott, who left $500,000 to the city with instructions to use the money to build a fountain on Belle Isle. There was only one condition - that a life-size statue of the donor be built beside the new fountain. The statue of James Scott sits in a chair facing beside the fountain, looking out toward the city. Belle Isle Park is open daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Admission is free."
"Birchwood Mall","Michigan","Birchwood Mall, Port Huron, MI","Birchwood Mall in Port Huron, Michigan is one of the many malls located in the state. This mall is run by GGP or General Growth Properties. GGP was created in 1954 as a mall, shopping center, and outlet mall real estate company. In 2009 GGP filed for a real estate bankruptcy, though this has had little effect on the mall remaining open. They still have 158 properties and are head quartered in Chicago, Illinois. Birchwood is a relatively young mall by mall standards, opening in 1990. The mall can house up to 107 stores and services, along with five anchors. Retail space is 790,000 square feet on one floor. The anchor stores include JC Penney, Macy's, Sears, Younkers, and Target. Birchwood Mall has a movie theater and food court for their visitors. When Birchwood Mall first opened a Wisconsin store chain by the name of Prange's was one of the anchor stores. However, this store became Younkers in 1992. Hudson's, Old Navy, and Dunham's Sports were also located in the mall during the 1990's. In 2001 Hudson's changed to Marshall Field's before becoming Macy's in 2006. Old Navy closed in 2007. The mall has been an attraction for Canadian shoppers as well as Michigan visitors. The Canadian shoppers come through Sarnia Ontario via the Blue Water Bridge. Mall hours are Monday through Saturday from 10am to 9pm, and Sunday 12pm to 6pm. Mall hours can change for holidays like Christmas or Thanksgiving when the mall is closed.

"Black Lake Golf Course","Michigan","Black Lake Golf Course, Onaway, Michigan - a Rees Jones-Designed Golf Course in Northern Michigan Ranked Among the Best Public Courses in the Country","Black Lake Golf Club is a Rees Jones design, and the latest addition to the UAW Walter and May Reuther Family Education Center located in Northern Michigan. The course is situated in heavily wooded lands on the southeast side of Black Lake, which is one of the largest inland lakes in the state. The course was designed by Rees Jones, who had never before worked in the hotbed of golf that is Northern Michigan. The result is a natural, 300-acre layout with a classic, old-style design that has become a trademark for Jones. One of the most distinctive features of the course is its approachable greens. All of them have been designed with ramps'' in the front so that short shots and bump-and-run approaches can all reach the putting surface, so long as they avoid the plentiful bunkers. Most of the greens themselves are designed with two tiers (or more), but the undulations are rather understated. The rest of the course makes use of the natural contours of the land, which Jones described this way: We were trying to build an old style, classic course. You'll notice we don't have mounds or moguls. We just have sweeps and natural grade. We strive for holes blending with the natural terrain. There is nothing artificial or contrived at Black Lake. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,030 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.3 and a slope rating of 140 on Pennlinks and Providence fairways and Providence greens, making it a challenge for even the best golfers from that length. When advising first-time players, local management offered three tips: one, be long and straight off the tee, otherwise errant shots will be lost in the woods; two, iron shots can be a bit loose, since the greens are so approachable; and three, don't over-read the greens as long as putts are on the correct tier. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include No. 6, which is one of the signature holes. This par-5 plays to 515 yards from the longest tees and is a great risk/reward hole. The hole plays from an elevated tee to a wide fairway and, for players who've hit a good drive, can be reached in two. The green is guarded by water on the front, left and back, however, so it requires an accurate approach shot. Since opening in 2000, Black Lake has received much acclaim, including being ranked #34 among America's Top 100 Public Courses by Golf Digest. Practice facilities at Black Lake are said to be unrivaled'' and include a 350-yard grass driving range, as well as four chipping and putting greens and four practice bunkers. The course also features a clubhouse with locker rooms, lounge and dining room. The Education Center also features other recreational facilities, such as a gym with two full-sized basketball courts, an Olympic-size indoor pool, an exercise and weight room, table tennis and pool tables, sauna, walking and biking trails, softball and soccer fields, and beaches and a boat launch ramp."
"Briarwood Mall","Michigan","Briarwood Mall, Ann Arbor, MI","Briarwood Mall opened in 1973 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It is currently owned by Simon Property Group and GM Pension Trust. Simon Malls manages the site, though. A. Alfred Taubman was the developer of the mall creating room for 120 stores and four anchors. Briarwood Mall is only one floor with 983,000 square feet of space. Simon Property Group began in 1993, but is an older company. Before Simon Malls the corporation was Melvin Simon and Associates.

"Comerica Park","Michigan","Comerica Park - Detroit, MI - Detroit Tigers baseball stadium","Since April 11, 2000, Detroit's Major League Baseball team, the Tigers, has called Comerica Park home. Prior to playing in Comerica Park, the Tigers played at The Corner'' - their famous stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull. Although many fans were initially skeptical, as The Corner had been a park of Tigers history for over 100 years, Comerica Park has now been embraced by most as an asset to the team. Plans for Comerica Park began long before the doors actually opened. After years of planning and budgeting, construction crews broke ground in October of 1997. The design, sometimes debated, continued to evolve as it was built, and Tigers owner Mike Illitch played a large role in the decision-making. In the end, Comerica Park cost over $300 million to complete, but most of the people involved in the project have noted they are happy with the classic ballpark feel combined with unique Detroit elements. The name for the park was decided in 1998, when Comerica Incorporated gave the Tigers $66 million in exchange for naming rights. Comerica Park is more than just a baseball field. However, although fans can visit a number of other buildings that are a part of the park, none of these outlying buildings obstruct the view from the stadium itself. The ballpark has no upper deck outfield seats either, giving fans the optimal view of the game and the Detroit downtown skyline. They have one of the largest scoreboards in professional baseball and a sunken field for the best view of the game. The stadium was built so that it could someday have a retractable roof, should they decide to add it. Along with Tigers administrative offices, Comerica Park had over 70,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space that fans can peruse prior to or following a game. The concourses in this stadium are much wider than those in an average MLB ballpark, and as visitors make their way through the main concourse, they can visit the Walk of Fame. Designers have created a timeline, complete with decade monuments, which reach from floor to ceiling. There are plans to continue with this historical part of the park in the future, as the Tigers meet new goals. Comerica Park has a number of unique features that aren't found in any other MLB parks. First, in their food court, fans of any age can ride their carousel, which has tigers to ride instead of horses. They also have a baseball-inspired Ferris wheel. Most interesting to many of their fans, however, is the water fountain. Called Liquid Fireworks,'' these spraying fountains are located in center field. The ballpark stages shows with their fountains synchronized to music. When a Tiger team member hits a home run, two tigers on the scoreboard roar and the center field fountains shoot into the air. Ticket price depend on the games being played, the time of year, and the location of the seat. There are many seating options available including premium seats in the on-deck circle, tiger den, infield box, terrace, outfield box, and club seats. Comerica Park has seating capacity of bearkt 42,000. To learn more or schedule a tour of the facility visitors can call 313-471-2074, and to purchase tickets to a game at Comerica Park, fans can call 1-866-66-TIGER."
"Courtland Center","Michigan","Courtland Center, Burton, MI","Tucker Development is the owner and management company for Courtland Center Mall in Burton, Michigan.

It has affected the profits of Courtland to a degree, yet some individuals still shop at Courtland based on its location. The anchor stores are JC Penney, Dunham's Sports, Staples and Jo-Ann Fabrics. This mall has a movie theater. When the mall was first opened it was called Eastland Mall. During this time there was space for three anchors including Woolco, A&P, and Kroger. The supermarkets left in 1970, allowing Jo-Ann's and JC Penney to take over the spaces. Later in 1982 the movie theater became the property of National Amusements, who split the one screen auditorium into two small screens. Crowley's moved into the mall as did the Fair. The Fair was taken over by Mervyns. Eventually in the late 1980's the mall was renovated, and obtained the current Courtland name. A great deal of renovation occurred in 2000's, allowing new stores to replace some of the older spaces like Mervyns when it left in 2006.

"Detroit Historical Museum","Michigan","Detroit Historical Museum - Detroit, MI - museum chronicling Detroit's history","In 1928, the Detroit Historical Society opened the Detroit Historical Museum, which today is one of the oldest and largest city museums in the United States.

Along with recreated pieces, this shop includes real historical items, including artifacts that date back to the 1840s. Another popular exhibit in the Detroit Historical Museum is named The Motor City. This display, which was opened in 1995, celebrates the city's automotive industry. It starts with the opening of Detroit's car factories and follows the timeline of these companies to their presence in Detroit today.

"Detroit People Mover","Michigan","Detroit People Mover - Detroit, Michigan - light rail transportation through downtown Detroit","The Detroit People Mover is one of very few light rail public transit systems in the United States. The 2.9-mile track serves thirteen stations in downtown Detroit, making it easy to move around the downtown Detroit area. It is modeled on the same technology that operates the SkyTrain system in Vancouver and Toronto's Scarborough RT line. Although it has a daily ridership capacity of 288,000, the daily average ridership of the People Mover is about 7,500. Opened in 1987, the Detroit People Mover is an urban mass transit system which operates on a single track in downtown Detroit. The fully automated system was built to move up to 15 million people annually, but operates far below capacity at around 2 million people a year. The People Mover grew from 1966 legislation that allocated funds for the development of urban mass transit systems and created an administration, the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, to oversee the development of new types of mass transportation. Nine years later, with no notable results, the UMTA offered federal funds to cover most of the construction and startup costs of Downtown People Movers. While Detroit was not chosen as one of the winning proposals for those funds, the UMTA recommended that that city, along with Baltimore and Miami, be allowed to construct People Mover systems if they could do so without using new federal monies to do so. The four cities that won federal grant money to build People Mover systems eventually dropped out of the program, as did Baltimore, but Detroit and Miami went on to build People Mover light rail systems for their downtown areas. The People Mover opened in 1986 and has been in continuous operation since, though parts of it have been shut down during various construction projects in the city. The People Mover runs in a continuous clockwise circuit of thirteen stations. Six of the stations are built into existing buildings. Each station is embellished with original art, and provides access to a different part of the downtown area. The Times Square Station serves as home base for the People Mover. It houses the Detroit Transportation Corporation Operations Center and Maintenance Facility. Other stations include the Michigan Avenue Station, the Fort/Cass Station, the Cobo Center Station, the Joe Louis Arena Station, the Financial District, the Millender Center Station, the Renaissance Center Station, the Bricktown Station, the Greektown Station, the Cadillac Center Station, and the Broadway Station. Grand Circus Park Station is the final stop on the thirteen-station track. It is in the center of Detroit's newly renovated sports and theater district. All of these stations provide access to the most popular parts of the city's downtown area. The People Mover runs seven days a week, with varying hours. Monday through Friday, the trains run from 6:30 AM to midnight. Fridays, they run from 6:30 AM to 2:00 AM. Saturdays the trains run from 9:00 AM to 2:00 AM, and Sunday they run from noon to midnight.

"Detroit Zoo","Michigan","Detroit Zoo - Royal Oak, MI - animal zoo, preservation, and research center","Just north of the Detroit city limits, tourists can visit the Detroit zoo, which is home to almost 7,000 animals. With over 270 species, including some endangered species, this zoo is one of the largest and most popular in the area. They also work to protect, preserve, and research the animal species represented at this zoo. The Detroit Zoo was founded in 1883. At this point, it was located on Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, which is across the street from Comerica Park, the Tigers ballpark. In the 1880s, a circus came to Detroit, but while there, it went bankrupt. A Detroit philanthropist purchased the animals and started the zoo. Just a year later, the zoo closed, but in 1911, a society formed to reopen it. That occurred in 1928, when the zoo moved to Royal Oak, and Detroit became the first city in the United States to have a cageless'' zoo. Some of the earliest exhibits, which still exist today, include Bear Den, Baboon Rock, the Reptile House, the Giraffe Encounter, and the Elk Exhibit. Today, some of the most popular exhibits are those centered on the zoo's Species Survival Plans or SSPs. American SSPs were first developed in the 1980s, and they are meant to help ensure the survival of species in zoos and aquariums. Some of the endangered species at the Detroit Zoo include trumpeter swans, partula snails, polar bears, and wolverines. However, there are some animals that visitors will not find at the zoo. In 2005, they became the first zoo in the country to voluntarily give animals to another zoo on ethical grounds. They admitted that Michigan winters are too cold for these animals and it wasn't right to keep them indoors confined for months on end. Since then, other northern zoos have also relocated some of their animals. One of the most popular exhibits at the Detroit Zoo is the Arctic Ring of Life, which first opened in 2001 and is the world's largest polar bear exhibit. The bears have a 300,000-gallon aquarium that has a 70-foot long, 12-foot tall tunnel, which is made of four-inch thick clear acrylic walls. The bears swim over and beside the tunnel, giving visitors a unique view of the animals, especially as they are being fed. Another popular exhibit is the Australian Outback Adventure, which first opened in 2006. This exhibit covers two acres and has both red kangaroos and wallabies. Visitors walk through the area on a designated path, but there are only small wire fences separating the trails from the habitat, so the animals can hop around freely, even when guests are on the trail. Along with viewing animals, visitors can ride the park's railroad, participate in animal feeding demonstrations, and go on picnics in any of the designated areas. Guided tours are available for group with an advance reservation, and there are several refreshment stands throughout the area that sell pizza, fries, chicken tenders, hamburgers, ice cream, and drinks. There are also regular events and special exhibits throughout the year, and to learn more, guests can call 248-541-5717."
"Detroit Zoological Park in Detroit, Michigan","Michigan","Detroit Zoological Park in Detroit, Michigan","Opened in 1883, the first Detroit Zoo was located on Michigan and Trumball Avenue, across from the current Tigers Stadium. A circus arrived in Detroit and went bankrupt, Luther Beecher a leading Detroit businessman, financed the purchase of the circus animals and erected a facility for their display and called it Detroit Zoological Park. The facility was closed the following year and converted into a horse auction house. Although the Detroit Zoological Society was founded in 1911, the zoo did not officially open until August 1st, 1928. In 1930, Bears Den and Sheep Rock were added to the facility and were followed by the addition of the Bird House. The Elk Exhibit, Baboon Rock, Primate and Reptile Houses were constructed a short time later. The Detroit Zoo was the first zoo in the United States to feature cage-less exhibits throughout the facility. Though the Great Depression put a temporary stay on further construction and expansion, the zoo resumed and has continued to grow since then. In 1939, Corrado Parducci, a sculptor, created the Horace Rackman Memorial Fountain, more commonly known as the Bear Fountain'', which marked the first of four major donations made by Mary Rackman, in honor of her late husband. Other exhibits include the Arctic Ring of Life, a $14.9 million interactive facility composed of 4-acres devoted to showcasing the relationship between people of the Arctic and wildlife. Amphibiville is a display dedicated to amphibians from around the world and is the home of the National Amphibian Conservation Center. The African Grasslands exhibit is designed to inform visitors about the unique ecosystem and native animals of Africa. The Australian Outback Adventure allows visitors to walk through an actual habitat and get up-close to native Australian wildlife. The Wild Adventure ride is the first zoo-based virtual reality voyage and allows guests to experience an educational, action-packed ride centered on wildlife. One of the most popular attractions at the zoo is the Tabur Family Railroad, which was presented to the facility in 1931, and serves more than 500,000 visitors each year. Approximately 99% of the animals found at the Detroit Zoo have come from other zoos around the country and all over the world. The Detroit Zoo strives to protect and preserve endangered and threatened animals. The zoo currently participates in the Species Survival Plans for 31 species including extinct-in-the-wild Partula snails and many other birds and mammals. Today, Detroit Zoological Society is a non-profit organization that operates both the Detroit Zoo and Belle Isle Nature Zoo. The society is responsible for the care and maintenance of approximately 1,800 vertebrates and 5,000 invertebrates which represent more than 270 different species. The zoo offers guided tours, animal feeding days, summer educational programs and camps for children and many other interesting experiences for visitors.

"Dinosaur Gardens Prehistoric Zoo","Michigan","Dinosaur Gardens Prehistoric Zoo - Ossineke, Michigan - Christian nature trail with dinosaur sculptures","Located in Ossineke, Michigan, the Dinosaur Gardens Prehistoric Zoo is a unique tourist experience that draws in thousands of visitors every year. This zoo'' isn't really a zoo, as there are no live animals. Rather, this park is stocked with replicas of dinosaurs, based on current scientific information and the artist's personal convictions. The Dinosaur Gardens Prehistoric Zoo features over 25 exhibits spread out over 40 acres of scenic trails. The most popular activity while visiting this park is to enjoy nature while exploring the various full-scale dinosaur statues. These life-sized reproductions are located along trails where visitors can experience undisturbed northern Michigan wilderness. Along with the dinosaurs, guests will see live plants and animals native to this area, living in both the woods and the Devil River, which runs through the gardens. This area is especially well-known for its bird watching opportunities. After reading about some of the prehistoric creatures that once inhabited the Earth, guests can play a round of miniature golf at the 18-hold Raptors Mini Golf Retreat. Nearby, the park has a gift shop filled with dinosaur items for both kids and adults, and they also provide a snack bar and picnic tables. Visitors can bring their own lunches or choose from the garden's menu, which includes pizza, hot dogs, French fries, popcorn, onion rings, and hamburgers. Construction on the Dinosaur Gardens Prehistoric Zoo began in the late 1930s with a local artist named Paul N. Domke, Sr., who is better known for his near-by statues of Paul Bunyan, and his wife, Lora Domke. The two frequented the Field Museum in Chicago and the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, D.C., where Paul sketched some of the bones and prehistoric animal displays on display. Once home, he sculpted full models of these creatures, which he used to create displays in the woods he owned. The trails are about a half-mile long from start to finish. There is no tour guide. Many of the sculpted animals in this park are not scientifically accurate, but rather the artist's interpretation of prehistoric times. Alongside dinosaurs, visitors can also see reproductions of mastodons, cave people, and birds. Plaques along the trail help to guide guests. Although visitors are asked not to climb on the statues, which are freshly painted annually, there is one interactive display named The Greatest Heart. The Domkes were devote Christians, and although they embraced theories of evolution, they believed that Christian concepts could work hand-in-hand with science. In The Greatest Heart, visitors can walk up a staircase and inside of a Brontosaurus, where Domke created his idea of the heart and lungs of the animal. Inside of the heart frame, he painted a picture of Jesus, with the inscription the greatest heart of all.'' A large statue of Jesus can also be found at the entrance, holding a globe in his hand. Ossineke is located on the western side of Lake Huron and is a popular site for religious retreats.

"Dossin Great Lakes Museum","Michigan","Dossin Great Lakes Museum - Detroit, Michigan - historic maritime museum in Michigan","The Dossin Great Lakes Museum, which is operated by the Detroit Historical Society, is a Great Lakes historical museum located on the shores of Belle Island. This museum chronicles the natural and culture histories of the Great Lakes and Detroit River areas, and it has a number of exhibits that rotate occasionally to ensure that guests always have something new to see at this tourist destination. When visitors first walk into the Dossin Great Lakes Museum, they enter The Gothic Room, a room that is designed to look like the 1900s gentlemen's lounge from the ship City of Detroit III. This ship traveled between Detroit and either Cleveland or Buffalo and was scrapped in 1956. Before she went to the junkyard, the Dossin Historical Society raised money to buy the Gothic Room, which was essentially moved and restored in the museum. This is a popular location for special events and weddings, as it can be rented during non-museum hours. Another maritime fixture that moved to the museum instead of being scrapped is the SS William Clay Ford pilot house. This freighter transported metals on the Great Lakes, typically from the River Rouge Steel Plant to the Ford Motor Company. It was scrapped in 1987, and at this point the entire pilot house was moved and reconstructed in the museum. The L is for Lighthouse exhibit is another important and popular part of the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. Located in DeRoy Hall, this exhibit highlights the lighthouses of the Great Lakes region, recording their locations, navigational and lighting features, and more. There are also artifacts that chronicle the lives of the men and women who worked and, in some cases, lived in these structures, and there is a collection of lenses in this museum from lighthouses around the Great Lakes area. There are a number of other permanent and temporary exhibits located at the Dossin Great Lakes Museum. This location is well known for their collection of ship models, which are rotated at least once a year. There's also a collection of signal flags, along with an exhibit about Detroit's growth in conjunction with the River and an exhibit on Bob-Lo Island. When visiting this museum, guests can explore the exhibits on their own or they can join a tour to learn more about the Detroit area's maritime history from one of the museum's knowledgeable staff members. School tours are available for teachers or home school groups, and they also have tours available for families, church groups, senior citizen centers, and other organizations that are interested in guided tours. The museum is available to host special events, and they also have a number of annual events every year, including the Great Lakes Shipwreck Festival, which features special exhibits, sessions on the shipwrecks in the Great Lakes areas, and other events in conjunction with the Ford Seahorses Scuba Diving Club. There are also day-long symposiums, galas, and charity events at this location every year. The Dossin Great Lakes Museum is open on Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Admission to this museum is free, though they do welcome donations at the door. For more information, visitors can call 313-833-7979."

"Dutch Village, Holland, Michigan, a Typical 19th-Century Netherlands Village Re-Created in Michigan","Michigan","Dutch Village, Holland, Michigan, a Typical 19th-Century Netherlands Village Re-Created in Michigan","In 1910, Frederick Nelis asked his 17-year-old son Harry to travel from their home in Beverywyk, Netherlands to America in search of rich farm land. The first World War had recently ended, times were tough all over Europe, and the elder Nelis hoped to find a better life for his family in the land of opportunity.'' Young Harry departed by ship in late 1910, and his search took him to Ellis Island, then on to Missouri where the rest of the Nelis family eventually joined him. They tried to support themselves by growing vegetables, but abandoned that endeavor and moved to Chicago in search of new opportunities. After several years of odd jobs, the Nelis family heard of a nascent Dutch community in Holland, Michigan. Upon arriving in Holland, Michigan, the beauty of the area so impressed the Nelis family that they purchased 80 acres of land just north of the town. In the early years there, they grew vegetables as they had in Missouri and made many trips to the produce markets in Chicago. The Great Depression forced them to again abandon the vegetable business, and the Nelis family tried their hand at the nursery business. For a few years, the primary nursery crop consisted of daffodils, but they subsequently added a crop of tulips, which would dramatically change the business and alter their lives. Tourists had begun flocking to Holland in the late 1930s for the new Tulip Time Festival, and the Nelis tulip farm became a popular destination. As the years passed, the Nelis tulip farm became so popular that the family added a large windmill and a souvenir shop. Later, a caf, was added to allow visitors to sample and enjoy Dutch specialty foods. Many buildings and attractions were added each year thereafter, and there are now 30 structures in the Dutch Village, all representing different provinces in the Netherlands. Today, the village called Noordhuizen'' includes canals, lush gardens, brick walkways, and authentic Dutch architecture, including windmills. There are also special presentations that depict life in a typical Netherlands village in the late 1800s, as well as costumed klompen (wooden shoe) dancers, a towering 25-bell carillon that greets visitors, street organs, and a carousel. Other attractions and activities include the Frisian farmhouse and barn, which demonstrates how a typical Dutch family would have lived. There's also a wooden-shoe factory where shoes are carved by hand using antique, automated machinery. Visitors are even encouraged to try on a pair of klompen, while children can delight in sliding down a giant wooden-shoe slide, feeding barnyard animals, and riding the restored antique carousel. For anyone brave enough to be tested and possibly found guilty of practicing witchcraft, visitors can step onto the Heksenwaag - a 200-year-old witches' scale.'' And no visit would be complete without a visit to the Klederdracht (costume) Museum, which features authentic costumes and settings, a Dutch country diorama, and an extensive doll exhibit of provincial costumes. Year after year, the Dutch Village continues to add activities, with additions such as Old Dutch Cheese Making, Street Scrubbing, Dutch Dancing Lessons, and Walking Our Goat, to name a few, making the Dutch Village a delightful family destination."
"Eagle Eye Golf Club","Michigan","Eagle Eye Golf Club, Lansing, Michigan ? An Upscale Links-Style Course with an Island Green Modeled After the Famous Sawgrass Hole","Eagle Eye Golf Club is a public course and part of the Hawk Hollow Community, which features 45 holes of championship-caliber golf, as well as a nine-hole walking course and 18-hole putting course. The Eagle Eye course opened in 2003 and is situated just a few minutes from the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan. The 18-hole, par-72 course was designed by Chris Lutzke, in collaboration with legendary golf course architect Pete Dye, and is a rolling, links-style layout. The course plays to a whopping 7,318 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 76.4 and a slope rating of 145. The course offers golfers five different tees from which to choose, however, and the White tees play to a mere 5,928 yards. The course has been described as visually spectacular and features the traditional links-course elements of fescue mounding and abundant sand bunkers. The landing areas are generous, but there are also numerous water hazards to contend with on 13 of the 18 holes. The greens tend to be very large and have been described as true-rolling.'' Golfers who have played and reviewed the course have described it as very difficult, and many a golf ball has been lost to the water that's almost everywhere on this course. Some reviewers have even said that the course asks you for a pint of blood,'' but also added that the par-3 holes on Eagle Eye will keep golfers interested. Hole No. 2 is one of those par-3s, a very short hole at 112 yards from the Whites, and 171 yards from the back tees. This is a fairly straight hole, but the catch is carrying one of the longest bunkers that golfers are ever likely to encounter on a par-3. Another noteworthy par-3 is No. 5, which trades sand for water. The hole plays longer at 146 yards from the White tees and 210 from the longest tees, and water runs the length of the hole on the left and the hole tends to tilt toward it, running away from the hills on the right. Hole No. 15 is a par-4 that plays to only 394 yards from the back tees, but water starts on both sides of the fairway and follows the right side of the hole up to the green. Adding to the challenge, the hole sits atop a hill that can be deceiving. Anything short will roll down the sloping crest, perhaps even beyond the original lie. The signature hole at Eagle Eye is the par-3 17th, which is modeled after the famous island green at Pete Dye's Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass. The hole plays to only 146 yards from the longest tee, but the green sits in the middle of water and steady nerves and the right club selection are mandatory on this hole. Since opening Eagle Eye has gotten some rave reviews and honors, including being named the 5th-best new course in America by Golf Digest in 2005. Michigan Golf Magazine also rated it the 4th-best course in the state in 2006. Practice facilities at Eagle Eye include a two-tiered driving range and two undulating putting greens. The course also features a luxurious, 65,000-square-foot clubhouse with locker rooms, a full-service pro shop and restaurant and lounge."
"Eastern Market","Michigan","Eastern Market - Detroit, Michigan - fresh foods market covering an entire neighborhood in Detroit","Detroit's Eastern Market is so large that it is more of a neighborhood than just an actual market. The huge complex of sheds and warehouses located close to downtown dates from the 1850s and covers around 43 acres. In fact, it is the largest historic public market district in the United States. The Eastern Market is a big attraction for both residents and visitors and is home to about 175 vendors. The city's first farmer's market was opened in Cadillac Square Detroit in 1841 and it initially sold mostly wood and hay; it was moved to its present location in 1891. As the market grew in popularity, additional sheds were built to accommodate vendors. After WWII, more food processors and wholesalers began to move in and the market became a major hub for wholesale food distribution. Overseeing the huge complex is the Eastern Market Corporation (EMC), whose goal is to ensure that the market is the major center for fresh food in southeast Michigan. The corporation does this in several ways: maintaining the market's unique identity, taking advantage of any economic incentives that might be available, and ensuring that streets, buildings, and open spaces are appealing and user-friendly. Over 100 people live in the Eastern Market; future plans call for up to 600 residents. The place to go for meat of all kinds is Gratiot Central Market. This building was built in 1915, but almost completely rebuilt in 1995, following a major fire. In addition to the usual poultry, pork, and beef, more unusual meats can be found here, including rabbit, goat, homemade sausage, and even Amish chicken. The market's bakery serves over 20 different varieties of pie. Although fresh produce and meats are perhaps the main attractions at eastern Market, there are other reasons to visit. The Artisan Village was created as a showcase for local artists and craftsmen to display and sell their work, and there are also several antique shops, art galleries, and hardware stores. Visitors can also learn something of the history of the market by taking a walking tour; these are held every Saturday morning during the summer months. The market has a program of events throughout the year, but one of the most popular is Flower Day, held every May. Flower Day features hundreds of vendors from Michigan and surrounding states exhibiting and selling flowers, trees, shrubs, and tropical plants. The festival is attended by an estimated 150,000 people every year and is one of the largest flower shows anywhere in the country; it's also the unofficial start of Detroit's summer season. The Eastern Market area is every day except Sunday, although Saturday tends to be the busiest day. It's estimated that around 45,000 people visit on a typical Saturday. In addition to the many shops, there are restaurants serving everything from fast food to Ethiopian cuisine. It is located about a mile northeast of downtown and is within easy reach of other neighborhoods such as the Riverfront and Lafayette Park. In 1978 the entire area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places."
"Eastland Center","Michigan","Eastland Center, Harper Woods, MI","An enclosed shopping mall in Harper Woods, Michigan is Eastland Center. The mall is located at 18000 Vernier Road, and managed by Jones Lang LaSalle. The management company is separate from the owner, though. The owner is Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. Eastland Mall was opened in 1957 by developer JL Hudson Corporation. Harper Woods is a suburb of Detroit, which means there are other malls for Michigan shoppers to go to if they desire. This mall has 88 stores with 4 anchor stores. However, they do have space for over a hundred stores and five anchors. Total retail space is 1,415,557 square feet with 7613 parking space. There is one floor for shopping, with a partial basement underneath a few of the stores. Planning started in 1951 for the mall, but with the end of one war and the beginning of rebuilding the economy plans took until 1957 to be completed. The plan was also under fire as some individuals did not care for the original design. When the mall was first built it was an open air mall with Hudson as the anchor. In 1975 the mall was renovated to be enclosed with JC Penney and Montgomery Ward added as anchor stores. 1985 marked the addition of a food court and movie theater. MainStreet, which was a department store chain moved into the mall in the mid 80's, was bought out by Kohl's in 1989. Kohl's closed in 1995 allowing Target to move in. Montgomery Ward closed numerous stores all over the United States in 1998 due to financial issues and JC Penney's had to close two years later. Even though Hudson's is owned by Target, the Hudson store was renamed Marshall Field's keeping that store and Target separate. In 2004 Steve and Barry's moved into the Montgomery Ward space. The last department store to be added to the mall was Burlington Coat Factory in 2009. Now the anchor stores are Macy's, Sears, Target and Burlington because even Steve and Barry's left. The mall's main attraction besides the stores is the centerpiece called the Lion and Mouse. It is a nine foot sculpture with a lion and mouse, which was original to the mall. The mouse was stolen in 1957, so a new mouse had to be created. They have gone through 6 mice as of 2007, and amazingly the 1957 mouse was returned in 2007 by the person who stole it. Some of the stores and eateries at the mall include 4 Men, Action Master, Applebee's, Ashley Stewart, Bakers, Beautiful Eyebrows, Capitol Jewelers, Champs Sports, Characters and Collectibles, Charley's, Charlotte Russe, Children's Place, Chili's, Claire's, and the Coffee Beanery. Additionally at the mall are Dakota Watch Company, Donna Sacs, European Perfumes, Exotic City Shoes, Famous Wok, Fashion Entourage, Finish Line, Foot Locker, G by Guess, Game Stop, Gilyana Tailoring, GNC, Gold Creations, H&R Block, and Jimmy Jazz. Mall hours of operation are 10am to 9pm Monday through Saturday, and Sunday 12pm to 5pm. However, holidays can vary the hours the Eastland Center is open."
"Elk Ridge Golf Club","Michigan","Elk Ridge Golf Club, Atlanta, Michigan - An Upscale Golf Course in the ``Elk Capital'' of Michigan","Elk Ridge Golf Club is located in Atlanta - not Georgia, but Michigan - the state's Elk Capital,'' about midway between Gaylord and Alpena in Northeastern Michigan As such, the course is one with nature and some of the largest elk herds in the state roam the fairways. Golfers should also not be surprised to encounter wild turkeys, bobcats, eagles and bear. The Jerry Matthews-designed course opened in 1991, and was laid out so as not to interfere with the wetlands, duck marshes and native wildlife. The course is what golf in Northern Michigan is all about, and features the customary rolling fairways, marshes, wetlands, fast, undulating greens, and an abundance of trees that golfers have come to expect. There are also good elevation changes and elevated tees, providing for the fun of those big drives downhill as well as some stunning views of the area. The course also features a number of doglegs, some strategic bunkering, as well as water in the form of lakes, wetlands, ponds, and streams all coming into play. The result is a good variety of well-groomed, contoured holes sculpted out of the Northern Michigan woodlands. The 18-hole, par-72 course covers 400 acres of land and plays to 7,058 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.7 and a slope rating of 143 on Bent grass. That 400 acres represents a sprawling amount of acreage, which allowed the course designers to make golfers feel secluded from the world, even when the course is packed. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 10, a par-3 that plays to only 164 yards from the Gold tees. This is one of the best elevated tees on the course, and the drop from tee to green is more than 100 feet. That will make the hole play even shorter, but golfers must be wary of the bunker that guards the right side of the green. It's said to shaped like a pig, but is a bear to get out of. No. 16 offers golfers more stunning views of Northern Michigan from an elevated tee. The par-4 hole plays to 381 yards from the back tees, and doglegs left around water and wetlands. Golfers can eliminate more of the dogleg by hitting a longer drive, but the approach shot that follows plays back uphill into an elevated green. This hole was voted one of The Best 18 Holes You Can Play'' by Golf Digest in 1997 Elk Ridge has received a number of accolades since opening, including being rated by Golf Digest in 1992 as the second-best new public golf course in the U.S.  That same publication also ranked the course #47 in 1996-97 among the Top 75 Upscale Public Courses in the country. Practice facilities at Elk Ridge include a driving range and putting green, and rental clubs are available. The course also features a distinctive clubhouse, designed to resemble Indian teepees, and features authentic Indian artifacts on display. The clubhouse also offers a restaurant and snack bar."
"Fairlane Town Center","Michigan","Fairlane Town Center, Dearborn, MI","Taubman Centers created four malls in Michigan during the late 60's and early 70's. The last mall they finished was in Dearborn, Michigan called Fairlane Town Center. Two of the malls are located in Ann Arbor, with the other in Detroit metro region. Fairlane is one of the only malls still under Taubman Centers management and ownership. This mall has 150 store fronts with 4 anchors. A total retail space of 1.5 million square feet on 3 floors exists, with 8000 parking spaces. The anchor spaces are roughly 200,000 to 245,000 square feet leaving 623,000 square feet of actual space for the current tenants. 122,000 square feet of space is currently unoccupied at Fairlane Town Center. When Fairlane opened officially in 1976, the mall anchors were Hudson's, JC Penney, and Sears. There was also an ice skating rink, 5 screen movie theater, and an elevated monorail car that would take shoppers to the Hyatt Regency Hotel. Two years after the mall opening Lord and Taylor moved in as an anchor. Saks Fifth Avenue was added in 1980. Over the years the ice rink was removed to build a United Artists movie theater with ten screens. However, it was closed in the 90's and 9 years later a 20 screen complex was built. The movie theater became an AMC at that time. Saks while still at the mall in the 90's converted to their outlet store. Hudson became Marshall Fields in 2001 before eventually changing to Macy's in 2006. A renovation project between 2004 and 2007 was completed refining the mall and H&M was added. The Saks outlet store was closed and demolished in 2008 to make way for a new wing with Bravo Cucina Italiana and PF Changs China Bistro as the replacements. The architecture at Fairlane Town Center is unlike most due to the monorail it used to have. The pedestrian walkways are on two floors, with a third floor set in the middle of the center courts. There had to be dual courts instead of a single grand court because of the monorail. There were seating areas and sculptures to add to the appearance of the mall with terrazzo flooring and wood trimmed glass railings. A water fall was also added to the mall. Mall hours are Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm. Sunday offers shorter hours of noon to 5pm. Holiday hours can also affect the mall with later hours and closures. Events are hosted at Fairlane Town Center like pictures with Santa and sales events. Store listings at Fairlane include 4 Men, Accessorize It, Acupressure Massage, American Eagle Outfitters, Fredrick's of Hollywood, GameStop, G by Guess, GNC, Express, Foot Locker, Kay Jewelers, Lee Beauty Supply, Lids, MJ Diamonds, Man Alive, Perfumania, Pretty Girl, Rainbow, Radio Shack and Things Remembered.

"Ford Field","Michigan","Ford Field - Detroit, MI - Detroit Lions football stadium","Ford Field has been the home stadium of the Detroit Lions, Michigan's professional football team, since August of 2002. This stadium is also used for concerts, college sports games, and other events when not being used by the Lions. The decision was made in 1996, when the team announced their intentions to build a new domed stadium adjacent to Comerica Park, the new Detroit Tigers baseball park. In November of that year, Wayne County voters approved the plans overwhelmingly, and construction began in 1999 with a Lions groundbreaking ceremony at which they announced the stadium's name and the design plans. The Ford Field complex covers nearly 1.8 million square feet, which includes the field itself, seating, and ground level restaurants, concessions, and stores. Costing over $500 million to complete, this stadium is unique in that it incorporated an existing historical building in its design. Hudson's Warehouse is part of the stadium and includes room for banquets, office space, food courts, a lounge, and all of the private suits. A seven-story atrium in the warehouse gives fans a view overlooking the city of Detroit. Overall, many experts believe that Ford Field has the best views of any United States football stadium. Along with the atrium, there are no high-level club and suite seats, so the upper level is lower, giving fans watching the game a great view of the city as well. This is keeping with the design of neighboring Comerica Park, which is also known for its low upper level and great views. Ford Field has 65,000 seats for fans, including 8,500 club seats that come with private lounges, food service, and preferred parking. There are 132 suites, with a capacity of 8 to 30 people, depending on the type of suite. Most of these suites are located in the warehouse. There are seven gated entrances to the stadium, leading to 32 main entrance doors, and players make use of 11 different locker rooms. There are a number of rental options for those wishing to hold events at Ford Field. These include the Hall of Legends banquet room, the South Cove reception area, the Atrium, the Adams Street reception area on the Main Concourse level, and, of course, the Detroit Lions playing field itself. Levy Restaurants, the food service company that runs all of the concessions and restaurants at Ford Field, is available to cater any booked event. Ford Field also has leasing options for Detroit businesses that want to relocate to the Ford Field complex. From 1913 to 1995, the warehouse was adjacent to a number of Hudson Department Stores. They have now been renovated to allow modern business to move in, and they already provide covered parking for customers, elevators, ATMs, and a coffee shop and cafy. For visitors interested in getting to know more about Ford Field, both public and private tours are available. From June to December, public walk-up tours are given at 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and from January to May they are given at the same times on just Mondays and Fridays.

"Ford Rouge Factory Tour Provides a Look at Automobile History","Michigan","Ford Rouge Factory Tour Provides a Look at Automobile History","Situated just south of Detroit in Dearborn, where the Rouge and Detroit Rivers meet, the massive Ford Rouge Factory was the pride and joy of entrepreneur Henry Ford and remains Ford Motor Company's largest single industrial complex. Once comprised of 93 buildings, nearly 16 million square feet of factory floor space, and 120 miles of conveyor belts, the Ford Rouge Factory - at its pinnacle prior to World War II - once employed 100,000 workers. While the complex has dwindled in size since the early days of automobile production, guests to the factory can still experience the glory days of the Ford Motor Company by participating in a fascinating tour of the complex. This six-part, mostly-self-guided tour of the factory, where the company's F-150 trucks are now produced, provides an excellent look at the history of automobile manufacturing in general and, more specifically, Ford's dominance of the industry from the 1920s until the 1960s. The tour begins on the grounds of the Henry Ford Museum where ticket holders board a bus for an excursion through what remains of the complex. Knowledgeable museum employees take visitors on a narrated driving tour past notable Rouge Factory landmarks, educating guests on the colorful history of the factory, its owner, and its employees. The other five parts of the tour are self-guided and include a visit to The Legacy Theater to view a 13-minute film on the history of Ford Motor Company's factory, including rare footage about triumphs and tragedies'' surrounding the Rouge complex. In addition, a multi-sensory, virtual reality-type theater puts guests in the middle of the manufacturing process via a 360-degree movie entitled The Art of Manufacturing.'' Guests can also make their way to the 80-foot-high observation deck to view the Rouge factory's living roof, the largest in the world. The roof is part of Ford's attempts to go green'' as they near the second decade of the new millennium, recognizing the impact the auto industry has had on the environment. In the Assembly Plant Walking Tour portion of the tour, visitors will be permitted to view the state-of-the-art manufacturing plant where new F-150s are assembled. An elevated walkway provides an excellent view of the final assembly process. Because production varies from month to month, the company does not guarantee that tour participants will be able to observe production on the day of their visit. Finally, the last stop, the Legacy Gallery, is a tribute to Ford's contributions to the auto industry and features five historic vehicles for visitors to admire, new F-150s for guests to explore, and a factory store where tour attendees can purchase Ford-related souvenirs."
"Forest Dunes Golf Club, Roscommon, Michigan - A Secluded, Upscale Golf Course in Northern Michigan","Michigan","Forest Dunes Golf Club, Roscommon, Michigan - A Secluded, Upscale Golf Course in Northern Michigan","Forest Dunes is an 18-hole upscale course at the Forest Dunes Golf Club in Roscommon, Michigan. A Tom Weiskopf design, the course opened in 2002 and traditionally ranks on the Top 100 list of most golf publications. It has also been ranked the #2 course in Michigan by Michigan Golf. For those who are unfamiliar with the Roscommon area of Northern Michigan, Forest Dunes is truly off-the-beaten path, as Roscommon has a predominantly rural population of around 25,000. That secluded element gives Forest Dunes a wild, natural feel to it, as the course runs through the pine trees and Birch groves of Northern Michigan's Huron National Forest, along a marsh, and through sandy dunes and grasslands. As Ron Whitten, Architectural Editor at Golf Digest, described the course, Half the holes at Forest Dunes are Augusta National style rolling down majestic corridors of red and jack pines, with elaborate bunkering of gleaming white sand. The remaining holes bring to mind Pine Valley, with dark, exposed native sand littered with scruffy underbrush. The mix is artfully blended on both nines.'' The par-72 course plays to 7,141 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.8 and a slope rating of 142. According to Wieskopf, commenting on his design, Forest Dunes replicates classic style and design and emulates a risk/reward involvement on most every hole. I consider this golf course to be one of the best which I have ever been involved in the U.S.'' Golfers who have played this course have said they'd have a hard time picking a favorite hole, as every hole is said to be unique and memorable. Some of the more noteworthy holes, however, include the par-3 No. 3 hole. Nicknamed Table Top,'' this hole plays to 203 yards from the I (Black) tees, but only 143 from the III (White) tees. What makes it so stunning and challenging is the forced carry over a very large sand bunker/waste area, to a green surrounded by four more uniquely shaped bunkers. The par-5 No. 5 hole is ranked as the most difficult on the course, and will probably challenge most golfers. The Mason Trail,'' as it's named, plays to 602 yards from the back tees, and a respectable 567 from the II (Blue) tees. A sharp dogleg left at the landing area will have golfers deciding if they can cut the corner over trees and sand. From there, the fairway is flanked on both sides by trees and two long bunkers/waste areas on the right, and the green features several undulations. The Point'' is a par-3 and the No. 9 hole that's both visually stunning and intimidating. The hole plays to 203 yards from the back tees and 151 from the Whites. The challenge is the forced carry over a large water hazard to a wide green flanked by five bunkers. The finishing hole is called Eagle Chance'' and is a par-5 that plays to only 531 yards from the back tees and 470 yards from the White tees, hence the name. When golfers first encounter this hole, they may think they're in the desert as they try to stay on the think strip of fairway flanked on all sides by sand and sandy grasslands. As they get closer to the hole, however, they'll encounter a large water hazard that runs along the left and around the green as the putting surface turns out into the water. An interesting feature of Forest Dunes is its 19th hole.'' Unlike most comparable names, which typically involve a snack bar/watering hole, this is an actual golf hole. The hole features a green with a bunker at its center, and the purpose of the hole is said to allow golfers one additional hole to settle a score. Practice facilities at Forest Dunes include a dual-ended driving range, bunkered greens and a short-game practice area. The facility also features a spacious Adirondack-style clubhouse with men's and women's locker rooms, as well as a bar, casual and formal dining, as well as spacious decks."
"Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park","Michigan","Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park - Grand Rapids, MI - outdoor sculpture collection and garden","The Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park is a unique art experience in Michigan. Guests who visit this park can check out year-round gardens, as well as both indoor and outdoor sculptures by artists from around the world. The park is an example of what happens when one combines natural beauty with man-made creations. There are more than 160 permanent pieces in this collection, as well as a number of revolving temporary exhibits and special pieces on loan from other museums. The Meijer Gardens is known as one of the most significant sculpture museums in the United States, with works dating back to the late 1800s. Most of the sculptures are located in Sculpture Park, an area that covers 30 of the 125 acres of gardens and woods. There are three other main sculpture areas - the Gallery, the Garden Trails, and the Conservatory. The Gallery Collection, along with the pieces in Sculpture Park, mainly focuses on works by representational, abstract, and non-objective artist. In Sculpture Park, guests can see works by famous names such as Rodine, Degas, and George Segel. Inside, visitors can enjoy more delicate sculptures from the same era. The Garden Trails and Conservatory are mainly focused on animal-inspired artwork, primarily in the representational style. The sculptures are displayed in a way to enhance the natural beauty of the gardens around them. As a part of these collections, visitors can enjoy the Lena Meijer Children's Garden, which features family-friendly artwork spread over five acres. In the Children's Garden, guests of all ages can experience Tree House Village, as well as nine other themed areas including the Butterfly Maze, the Story-Telling Garden, the Great Lakes Garden, and the Log Cabin. Kids can enjoy these areas with guides that show children interesting plants, tell stories, and allow them to play with shovels, boats, and other items to help them learn. While the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park has many pieces of artwork, they also help tourists enjoy natural art. Their horticulture collection has hundreds of species, and guests are encouraged to spend at least four hours on site to see all of the plants in their glory. Along with their acres of flowers and trees outside, which include an amphitheatre garden for concerts during the summer, the park has a number of indoor gardens, like their Arid Garden, a collection of cacti and other plants that like dry weather. They also have a tropical conservatory, a Victorian Garden, and a plant house especially for carnivorous plants. The Carnivorous Plant House is the only of its kind in the country and has over 550 plant species, such as the Venus Fly Trap. The Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park hosts a number of popular annual events, including Foremost's Butterflies are Blooming, the largest temporary tropical butterfly show in the United States. During March and April, guests can see over 6000 butterflies from all over the world. The park receives butterflies already in their chrysalises (cocoons), and visitors can watch through windows as the different species hatch. They are then released into the Conservatory, where guests can walk around for up-close views of these creatures as they fly around and enjoy the flowers. While the Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park is open year-round, it is important to keep in mind that Michigan's winters limit the time of year guests can enjoy the exterior sculptures and gardens. They are open seven days a week, though, and visitors can call 888-957-1580 for more information."

Management is through Jones Lang, and LaSalle; however, it is owned by Genesse Valley. The store is 1,200,000 square feet approximately with one floor and a mezzanine, with two floors in the department stores. Room for 127 tenants including 6 anchors can be found at Genesse Valley Center. A food court inside, along with an external area are other characteristics of this mall. The Outdoor Village is the external section with a Barnes and Noble Bookstore. When the mall was first built it housed Sears as the anchors store. Two months later Hudson's occupied the other anchor store. During this time fifty- six tenants were located at the mall including Hamady Supermarket and Cunningham Drugstore. A few months later Woolworth opened a dime store near Sears. Eventually JC Penney and Montgomery Ward attached themselves to the mall. Cunningham's space was demolished in order to build a site for Mervyn's since the drug store left. However, Mervyn's left later on. The mezzanine with a food court was added in the mid 1980's to help make it the largest mall in Michigan north of Detroit. Steve and Barry's, Marshfield's, and then eventually Macy's were anchor stores. Macy's, Burlington Coat Factory, JC Penney, and Sears are now the four of six anchors to be located at the mall. When Barnes and Noble moved in the mall lost B Dalton because the store did not have enough business to support it. Over time the mall has attracted a lot of other retailers.

The complex consists of seven connected skyscrapers, all centered around the central tower, which houses the tallest all hotel tower in the Western Hemisphere. The only all hotel tower in the world that is taller is Singapore's Swissotel, The Stanford, built in 1986. Since 1977, the building now known as the Detroit Marriot at the Renaissance Center has held the honor of being the tallest building in Michigan. In addition to the central tower, the Renaissance Center consists of four 39 story office towers and two 21 story office towers. The bases of the four towers include five stories of retail space referred to as podium space''. When GM renovated the complex in 2001, they added a five story atrium known as the Wintergarden. The Wintergarden faces the International Riverfront and offers riverfront access and a view of Canada across the river. The project is entirely owned by General Motors, who rent space out to retail and commercial tenants. The central tower is fully occupied by the Marriot at the Renaissance Center, flagship hotel of the Marriot chain and the largest hotel in the chain. It boasts 1,298 rooms on 73 stories. The top three stories of the tower are occupied by the Matt Prentice Restaurant Group Coach Insignia.

The founders of the museum, Georgia Woodrick Gietzen, Alyce Greeson, Carla Morris, and Aleicia Woodrick, created the museum based upon the belief that children learn best when they're at play and can direct their own learning. Located just off Monroe Center at 11 Sheldon Avenue NE in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the Museum Without Walls'' is a great place for children and parents to spend a day. The museum features an array of both permanent and changing exhibits where children can explore, learn, and play in a hands-on environment that celebrates both childhood and education.

A thick plexi-glass casing allows visitors to observe the daily activities and the lifecycle of honeybees - from creating beeswax and honey, to feeding their larvae, and, perhaps even seeing the larvae hatch. There's even a Queen Bee, and children are encouraged to try to identify her. Mirror Magic allows children to explore the magical world of reflections, prisms, distorted mirrors and kaleidoscopes.

Other permanent exhibits include: Funstruction, where children can get creative with Legos, building blocks and dominos; Spin Table, where it's a challenge to see how long visitors can get the discs to spin; and Rainbow Run, where children can create their very own rainbows. And for younger children, five and under, there's Wee Discover. Here, the wee ones can experience cooking something yummy in the kitchen, playing with soft blocks, or, for children not ready to walk, venturing into Crawler's Corner. In addition to the permanent exhibits, the GRCM offers special events and concerts, such as the kid-friendly music of Jeff Kagan. Jeff's creative, hip, silly, mountain-inspired nature music'' has been a hit with children since his album Rocky Mountain Tunes for Rocky Mountain Kids'' was released in April 2008.

Thanks to such creative exhibits and events, the GRCM has entertained and educated more than 1,500,000 children and adults from all over the world. In 2006, the Grand Rapids Children's Museum celebrated record-breaking attendance, serving more than 180,000 visitors.

The Reserve was dedicated on July 4, 1976 as a natural environmental classroom for area youth.'' Within the expansive tract can be found just about every type of cover that exists in the state of Michigan. There's a true swamp, a bog, a marsh, as well as a creek, river, and an active beaver pond. There's also level terrain, several types of soil, numerous plants, and upland and pine forests, all of which create an excellent habitat for deer, fox, otter, mink, and an assortment of birds and other animals. The central feature of the Reserve is the Boardman River, which runs for approximately two miles through the area. In the northern section of the Reserve, the river is impounded, creating the Sabin and Boardman Ponds, while the southern section is free-flowing, as is its natural state. In the southern area, the Boardman River is at its most dramatic, falling in a series of rapids and passing through the remnants of the old Keystone Dam and berm walls and spillways that are now being reclaimed by nature. In the river valley, there is evidence that a glacier formed the valley and then ground to a halt, providing an opportunity for students and others a glimpse into the history of the area and the earth. To assist visitors in moving throughout the Reserve, there are several miles of improved trails along the river, including more than 1200 feet of boardwalks and bridges. There are also five miles of developed trails, including the Boardman Pond Trail, which extends along the east and west sides of the pond. The Reserve also features several overlooks to allow visitors a better view of the river and surrounding area, canoe portage sites, a small boat launch, picnic areas, and a fishing platform.

"Grand Traverse Resort & Spa, The Bear Course, Acme, Michigan - A Jack Nicklaus Design and One of the Most Difficult Golf Courses in the Midwest","Michigan","Grand Traverse Resort & Spa, The Bear Course, Acme, Michigan - A Jack Nicklaus Design and One of the Most Difficult Golf Courses in the Midwest","Grand Traverse Resort & Spa is located near Traverse City, Michigan on the shores of Grand Traverse Bay. The resort can boast three upscale golf courses, including the best-known among them, The Bear, which opened in 1985. The 18-hole, par-72 course is a Jack Nicklaus design, but there may be some debate as to whether the course is named after its designer, the Golden Bear, or because it's one of the most difficult courses in the entire Midwest. The Bear is a links-style course that plays to 7,078 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 76.3 and a slope rating of 148 on Bent grass. The course features the traditional elements of Scottish, links-style golf courses, including terraced fairways, deep grassy rough, mounds, moguls, tiered greens, and deep pot bunkers. The course also features the elements of golf courses in Northern Michigan, including rolling hills, lakes, ponds, streams, hardwood forests, fruit orchards, and a variety of wildlife, from ducks and deer, to blue herons, swans, and muskrats. There are four lakes found on the course, and 10 of the 18 holes incorporate water hazards. For golfers playing the shorter tees, distance isn't the issue on The Bear. The White tees only play to 6,129. The difficulty begins right on the tee, where golfers are often unable to see the dozens of hidden fairway bunkers. The terraced (elevated) fairways often have a severe drop into thick rough, while the greens tend to be severely contoured, and seven of them are protected by water and involve forced carries. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 9, a par-3 that plays to what is essentially an island green surrounded by water. The hole is not especially long, playing to only 142 yards from the White tees, but there's little room for error as bunkers also guard both sides of the green. The hole also marks the transition to the back nine, which is said to be even more difficult than the front. The signature hole for the course is No. 13, another short par-3 that also involves a forced carry over water. The green is also surrounded by four bunkers, making an accurate tee shot a must for any chance at par. Hole No. 15 offers up some beautiful scenery, with a downhill fairway that hooks around a pond. With the green tucked behind the water hazard, there's little choice by to carry more water on the approach and aim for a green guarded by three bunkers. The finishing hole is considered one of the prettiest on the course, as well as the #2-handicap hole. This par-4 plays to 427 yards from the middle tees, but only 387 from the Whites. The difficult arises from a fairway that's split in two by a trough of rough and a large trees. A large pond then demands another forced carry to the green tucked behind the hazard. The Bear has received numerous honors and accolades over the years, including a 4-Star rating from Golf Digest, and a ranking as the #18 most difficult course in America. GOLF Magazine also gave the resort a Silver Medal award. Practice facilities at the resort include multiple indoor and outdoor hitting bays and short-game practice areas. The resort also features the Jim McLean Golf School, which has been voted as the best golf school in the country by various magazines. The Grand Traverse Resort & Spa features more than 600 rooms, suites and condominiums, four restaurants, four indoor and outdoor pools, seven hot tubs, as well as an Indoor Water Playground."

"Greektown","Michigan","Greektown - Detroit, Michigan - historical district in downtown Detroit","Home to Greektown Casino, Greektown is a historic district located just outside downtown Detroit, Michigan. The area, which runs along Monroe Avenue between St. Antoine and Brush Streets, is largely commercial, and features a heavy concentration of Greek restaurants along with several churches and the Greektown Casino. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The area that is known as Greektown today was originally settled by German immigrants in the 1830s. However, as the neighborhood matured, the first wave of immigrants moved to areas further out from downtown and were replaced by new Greek immigrants. Many of the new immigrants established businesses, including restaurants, stores, bakeries and coffee houses. As the area became more heavily commercialized, the residents moved out to more residential areas, but the businesses they'd established remained behind. By the mid-1960s, the once-thriving and busy residential neighborhood had become a few blocks of commercial buildings. In 1966, a group of concerned Greek businessmen approached the city with their concern that their neighborhood was in danger of disappearing. They organized the first annual Greek Festival to be held in the neighborhood, and worked with the mayor and the city to refurbish the neighborhood, installing new lighting and improving building exteriors. The Greek Festival ran for years until it grew too large. By the time it was discontinued, the Greektown neighborhood was well-established. Thanks to the efforts of the Greek community in Detroit, today's Greektown is one of the few remaining Victorian commercial neighborhoods in the city. The streets are lined with restaurants that serve authentic Greek cuisine, and traditional Greek music spills from the open doors of coffee houses, cafes and stores. The area has become a focal point of downtown and a destination in and of itself. While Greektown was originally predominantly Greek in flavor, recent years have seen the addition of Thai, Italian and Southern cuisines, giving the district a distinctly international flavor. Among the tenants of the historic neighborhood is the Greektown Casino, one of Detroit's three operating casinos. The Casino features over 100,000 square feet of gaming space that includes more than 2,500 slot machines, 67 table games, a VIP gaming area and a Poker Room. In addition to the Casino, the district features the Greektown Casino Hotel, billed as Detroit's newest hot hotel. The 30 story hotel is sheathed in translucent blue glass, standing out against the Detroit skyline. The hotel features 400 guest rooms including 2-3 bedroom suites.

"Heritage Hill Historic District, Grand Rapids, Michigan, One of the Largest Urban Historic Districts in the Country","Michigan","Heritage Hill Historic District, Grand Rapids, Michigan, One of the Largest Urban Historic Districts in the Country","Heritage Hill was the first neighborhood'' of the city of Grand Rapids. The original neighborhood appeared adjacent to the downtown area, and is bounded by Michigan Avenue on the north, Pleasant Street on the south, Union Avenue on the east, and Clarendon Place and Jefferson Avenue on the west. The district features more than 1,300 homes that date from 1848 and later, forming one of the largest urban historic districts in the United States. Among the homes of early lumber barons, city leaders, judges, teachers and others can be found more than 60 architectural styles, matching the diversity of ownership. That diversity continues into the present, as the historic district is home to many races, backgrounds and income levels - from professionals to trades people, from students to artisans, from singles to familes, from renters to homeowners. Today, the historic district is a treasured, preserved piece of history, but that was not always the case. In the 1960s and 70s, the area was being razed, house-by-house, as city leaders and developers sought urban renewal. But many of the residents and neighbors became organized and put forth a heroic effort to save the district, and, in so doing, preserved the legacy of many of Grand Rapids' professional and business pioneers. In 1971, after extensive study, federal officials added the entire Heritage Hill area to the National Register of Historic Places. Since then, it has grown stronger and become a source of pride to residents and an attraction to visitors. The district hosts its annual home tour the first weekend in October, and self-guided walking tour brochures are available courtesy of the Visitor Information Center in downtown Grand Rapids. On such tours, visitors get a glimpse at some of the finest homes from the Victorian Era, along with the varied architecture of the day. Visitors can see a number of design styles and decorative treatments, such as beaded spindles, curved muntins (the strips of wood or metal that hold panes of glass in windows), Doric columns, carved brackets, and creative entryways. The public houses available for viewing include: Meyer May House, 450 Madison SE, is a prairie-style'' house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1908 for the founder of May's of Michigan clothing store. It's open free to the public on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and Sundays from 1-5 p.m. Voigt House Victorian Museum, 115 College SE, is a French Chateau built in 1895 for Carl Voigt of the Voigt Milling Company. The home has been carefully preserved and is a fine example of the gracious elegance of the Victorian era. It is open to the public on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month from 1-3 p.m. and every Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. In addition, a few select small businesses and food emporiums have found their way into the district.

"Kerrytown, Ann Arbor","Michigan","Kerrytown, Ann Arbor - Ann Arbor, MI - historic business district and neighborhood in Ann Arbor","Kerrytown is a neighborhood in Ann Arbor, Michigan that couples business with residences with a hometown feel. This part of the city is home to a number of cultural destinations, as well as historic landmarks. The merging of old and new n Kerrytown makes this a popular place to live in Ann Arbor. Kerrytown is located today on the site that was once the original village of Ann Arbor. It is named after County Kerry in Ireland, which was the home of the family who originally founded Kerrytown in the late 1870s. Travelers who visit Kerrytown today can still see some of these historic buildings. The homeowners and shop owners in this neighborhood have worked hard to preserve the look and feel of this part of the city, keeping the bricks and beams of the buildings here in good condition. One of the most popular structures in Kerrytown is their bell tower. Located atop the market building, this tower is home to a 7-ton bell choir, made up of 17 chimes of different tones. Ten of these bells were originally cast in the 1920s for St. Stephen's Church in Cohasset, Massachusetts. In 1997, Kerrytown decided to restore the bells and build the town. They cast an additional seven bells, made by Royal Eijsbouts in the Netherlands. The bell tower is officially classified as a chime, which is a smaller version of a carillon, which has 24 or more bells in total. With 17 bells, though, the Kerrytown chime can play most sons. Tourists can play the bells as part of a unique tour opportunity in Kerrytown. Guests can play or hear the bells every Wednesday and Friday at noon or every Saturday at 10:30 AM. Visitors can also make an appointment at a special time to play the bells. They have a very small staff of just a single person who acts as a Chime Master to facilitate the ringing of the bells. Guests don't need any musical experience to play a song, since the Chime Master has a number of cards that teach aspiring players to play a simple song. Along with the bells, visitors can shop at some of the stores located in this historic neighborhood. Some of the restaurants and cafes in this area, many of which embrace the past, include Sweetwater's, Casey's Tavern, Argerios Italian Restaurant, Eve, Kosmopolitan, and Metro Caf,. Also popular is the Kerrytown Farmer's Market, where residents and visitors can browse through rows of fresh fruits and vegetables. Other interesting businesses include Vicki's Wash & Wear Haircuts and Heavenly Metal, which is a hair salon and gallery in one, and the People's Food Cooperative, which is Ann Arbor's only membership community-owed grocery store. Kerrytown is attractive to shoppers because of the ability to just walk around and visit a number of small shops, rather than having to driver everywhere. They are also a GLBT-friend community, with a gay bar located near the shops, and a number of pride events and groups. They are served by the Ann Arbor Observer, and have a concert house for regular events and shows that come to the area. Kerrytown is just a short drive to all of Ann Arbor's attractions, like the University of Michigan Museum of Art. Kerrytown combines the old with the new to give visitors something completely different, and thus, it will remain a growing neighborhood in terms of tourism and residency."

Located on the Calder Plaza in front of the Grand Rapids City Hall, the sculpture serves as a distinctive landmark and symbol of the city. Its likeness can be found on most things related to the city, from its letterhead, to its street signs, to its city vehicles. Before Calder began work on the sculpture, he studied the architectural plans, scale, and materials of the buildings adjacent to the site. He designed a sculpture that responded well to the plaza and the surrounding architecture. The sculpture was also designed to provide a dramatically different view from each corner of the square. The project was first conceived in 1967, when the city of Grand Rapids was planning a new city hall to help bring the blighted area back to life. A request for funding from the fledging federal National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) resulted in the agency's first project in its public arts initiative - a grant of $45,000 to the city of Grand Rapids. Nancy Mulnix, who co-chaired the sculpture project with Peter Wege, retired vice chairman of Steelcase, and her committee then raised the additional $83,000 needed to complete the project. Alexander Calder, considered one of our country's preeminent artists and sculptors, was then selected to create the first civic sculpture financed by both the federal government and private funds. The nearly complete sculpture arrived in May of 1969 - 42 tons of art in a series of enormous crates. The 27 separate sections of the sculpture still needed to be bolted and welded together, and cranes lifted the towering pieces into place. The entire assembly process took five days, after which the vivid Calder Red paint was applied, proclaiming the project complete. While the sculpture tends to evoke a range of reactions and comments from onlookers - from distinctive,'' to monstrosity,'' to way out'' - it served its intended purpose. It not only helped revitalize the area, but it also sparked the city's interest in art and led to a new art museum, symphony hall and a civic theater soon after. It's also been said by those involved with the project that it gave the community a positive attitude that anything is possible.'' According to City Historian Gordon Olson, It led to a change in attitude so that the assumption now is that every good community project should include a piece of public art.'' In honor of the Calder sculpture's birthday, the City of Grand Rapids celebrates the event with an annual arts festival, which encompasses ten city blocks and is attended by a half a million people."

"Lakeside Mall","Michigan","Lakeside Mall, Sterling Heights, MI","Taubman Centers built four malls in the Detroit region of Michigan. Lakeside Mall is one of the malls located in a suburb of Detroit called Sterling Heights. The mall was opened in 1976, but is no longer a part of Taubman. It was sold to GGP or General Growth Properties, so this company also manages the mall. A total of 150 stores and 5 anchors fill the 1,500,000 square feet. The department stores have between 160,000 and 320,000 square feet of space. The entire mall has two floors, unlike some of the other Michigan malls. At the time of Lakeside Mall's grand opening, Hudson's, Lord and Taylor, Sears and JC Penney were the anchors. The mall also included an ice rink and movie theater. However, the latter was replaced by a water slide before it too was gone and the home to Tilt a video arcade. Crowley's department store took up the fifty anchor spot in 1981. It closed in 1997 and Hudson went through a renovation to change the ceiling. The movie theater closed to become FYE. Eventually Tilt met its end to make room for the food court. Many changes have occurred at Lakeside Mall in a forty year period with Hudson being renamed Marshall Field's, Steve and Barry's being added and then closed, and H&M moving in the FYE location. Macy's, JC Penney, Sears, and Lord & Taylor still remain at the mall, along with H&M. Lakeside Mall is considered a twin to Fairlane Town Center with the similar decor. It has terrazzo tiled floor, recessed accent lighting, hexagonal sky lighting with wood railings and glass inserts. It differs from Fairlane in the 2 floor construction rather than the 2- 3 floor split of the other mall. Mostly minor changes in renovations have been made at Lakeside Mall. Mall hours are 10am to 9pm, except on Sunday which is 12pm to 6pm. Holiday hours can mean extended hours around Thanksgiving Day up till Christmas Eve. The mall is closed for Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Other holidays can also affect mall hours. Mall events such as Santa photos and sales are available for shoppers in the area. Dining and entertainment can be found at the mall at Double Decker Carousel, the food court, Kerby's Koney Island, Macy's Lakeshore Grill, Olga's Kitchen, and Panera Bread. These locations are in the mall, and not out parceled. The carousel is not an antique, but it will run for little children to enjoy. The food court has the typical mall fare including Lil Angel Donuts. Stores at Lakeside Mall include 90's Nails, A&Z Fine Arts, Abercrombie, Aerie, Kid's Foot Locker, Leather City, LensCrafters, Lids, Aeropostale, Limited, Aldo Shoes, Alter Ego, Ann Taylor, American Hot Rod Racer, Majic Window, Manic Shoes, AT&T, MasterCuts, and Mattress Mountain. Other locations are Beau Deli, Merle Norman, Bebe, Millie's Polish Kitchen, Body Shop, Mobile Life, and Carlton Cards. Lakeside has numerous stores for all shoppers and is not currently a struggling mall like a few others in Michigan."
"Lakewood Shores Resort, The Gailes Course, Oscoda, Michigan - The Look and Feel of the Famous Seaside Golf Courses of Scotland","Michigan","Lakewood Shores Resort, The Gailes Course, Oscoda, Michigan - The Look and Feel of the Famous Seaside Golf Courses of Scotland","The Gailes Course at Lakewood Shores Resort in Northeastern Michigan is one of three distinctly different courses found at the resort. The Gailes Course, which opened in 1992, was designed by Kevin Aldridge and features rolling fairways, pot bunkers, tall, fescue-covered mounds and heather roughs, which create the look and feel of the famous seaside courses of Scotland. The Gailes is said be to an old-world'' golf experience - a true Scottish Links design with meandering berms, sod-faced bunkers and occasionally strong winds blowing in off Lake Huron. The fairways at The Gailes are generous and nicely sculpted and, because the grass is cut so short, particularly close to the greens, golfers will find their putters the club of choice even many yards from the actual putting surfaces. The greens themselves tend to be huge, but are fast and undulating. Encountering a crown or swale on the putting surface is not uncommon. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,954 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.0 and a slope rating of 138. Even the much shorter Blue (6,393 yards) and White tees (6,073 yards) can prove a challenge for first-time visitors to the Gailes. That's because Lakewood Shores has chosen not to make use of a pin-placement system - an intentional design feature that forces golfers to adhere to the time-honored tradition of calculating distance for themselves. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 5, the #1-handicap hole. The par-4 plays to 498 yards from the back tees, but a more manageable 408 from the Blues. Difficulties can be encountered with the creek that crosses the fairway about 180 yards from the tee, as well as the fescue-covered mounds on both sides of the fairway. The green is designed for a bump-and-run approach, but golfers must be wary of the pot bunker on the right and a grassy swale on the left. Hole No. 10, Over the Hill,'' is a short par-4 that captures the essence of links golf. Hidden hazards abound and the hole demands one of the best tees shots of the round. There's a forced carry off the tee that requires a long iron to a landing area surrounded by a quagmire of mounding, deep sod-faced bunkers and knee-high fescue. The approach shot that follows plays to a slightly hidden green guarded by bunkers on the left. The Gailes has received a number of awards and accolades since opening, including being named the #1 Resort Course in Michigan by the Detroit News Golf Guide, 1997, and being ranked the #1 Public Resort Course in Michigan by Golf Digest in 1996. Practice facilities at The Gailes include a driving range with 15 tees, two putting greens and the Wee Links, a pitch-and-putt course with holes ranging from 50 to 105 yards. The course also features a full-service clubhouse with both casual and fine dining at the Scotland Cove restaurant. Lodging is also available in the resort's 152 rooms, and other activities include a private beach on Cedar Lake for swimming, jet skiing, canoeing and fishing. The resort is also just minutes away from Lake Huron."
"Lansing Mall","Michigan","Lansing Mall, Delta, MI","General Growth Properties has numerous malls and outdoor shopping centers around the US. One of their properties is in Lansing, Michigan in the small township of Delta. Lansing Mall was opened in 1969, though it is unknown who the developer was. The mall is one floor, with two floors in one of the four anchor stores. Total the mall has retained 100 stores and services. The square feet of the mall are 830,000. When Lansing Mall was first opened it contained three anchor stores: The Fair, Wurzburg, and Federal's. Wurzburg became Knapps before it was closed. Federal's closed in 1972, and The Fair became Montgomery Ward. In 1979 a mall extension demolished the area Federal's used to be in allowing the western wing to expand and house Hudson's. Knapp's was no longer a viable company leaving room for JC Penney, which has the only two floor structure in the mall. In 1987 northern wing was added to Lansing Mall for Mervyns, and the fourth anchor store. General Growth Properties did not obtain the mall until 1997, and they began a 30 million dollar renovation. The remodel added a food court, more seating for customers, and new restroom facilities. Barnes and Noble, and Old Navy moved in at this time. In 1999 Montgomery Ward left due to bankruptcy. Younkers was able to move in during 2002 along with Dunham's Sports. Today the four anchor stores are TJ Maxx, JC Penney, Younkers, and Macy's. Old Navy and Mervyns could not last. There have been discussions about redeveloping the mall again to make an open air center, but nothing has been approved yet. Mall hours will vary during the year when a holiday is approaching. For example the day after Thanksgiving the mall is open longer, yet closed on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Normal mall hours are Sunday noon to 6pm and Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm. Lansing Mall does allow mall walkers. They also have mall events like photos with Santa and sales events. Lansing Mall has a number of restaurants and entertainment areas for shoppers.

This mall is one of the more progressive as one of three Detroit malls to add big screen televisions throughout the mall for store advertising. In 2008 a food court was finally added to the mall near the Marriott Hotel entrance. Mall hours are Monday to Saturday 10am to 9pm. The mall is also open Sunday from noon to 6pm. Hours can vary in the department stores and for special events. For example mall walkers are allowed in the mall in the mornings.

"Livonia Mall","Michigan","Livonia Mall, Livonia, MI","Livonia Mall was first opened in 1964. Its location was in a Detroit, Michigan suburb also called Livonia. The mall is no longer open, having closed in 2008 due to rough economic times and age. The mall unlike Laurel Park Mall a few miles away did not have enough to attract shoppers in the later years. Laurel Park Mall opened in the 80's taking with it numerous shoppers from the Livonia Mall location. However, Livonia will not lack a Livonia Mall for much longer. In 2008 plans for redevelopment were discussed with the Livonia City Council. They came to a conclusion that the mall would be demolished and redevelopment would begin. The demolition began on January 2009 and was completed in August 2009. The new mall will be called Livonia Marketplace. It is to be a power center meaning that it will be an open air mall with at least 250,000 square feet of leasable retail space. The details on this particular center were released in August. The mall will contain 350,000 square feet of space. It will be more about walking around outdoors for exercise and enjoyment during the shopping experience. Rather than a food court, restaurants will be interspersed throughout the space. These open air malls all have anchor stores, and Livonia Marketplace will be anchored by Wal-Mart. As for Lavonia Mall it was owned by Konover Properties. It had over fifty stores with two tenants when it was first built. Sears and Crowley's were the anchors. In the 80's Mervyn's and Child World moved in. The 1990's and 2000's were extremely rough on the mall which is when the mall lost most of its tenants. In 2006 Mervyn's closed. Eventually the Mervyn's space which was filled with Value City also emptied. By 2008, during the mall closure, Sears and Jo-Ann Fabrics were the only tenants left in the area. Sears vacated the areas before demolition began, but Jo-Ann's did not close until demolition began. Besides the anchor stores Children's Palace and a paintball arena were located at the mall. All of this of course began to close in the 90's. Foot Locker, Dollar Tree and other independent shops had presences at the mall until the redevelopment was discussed. It may be that many of the stores that left will move back in after the new development has been built. For now Livonia is going to be named a dead mall, and Livonia will have to wait for the completed construction. Groundbreaking began in September. The Livonia Phoenix LLC in partnership with Grand Sakwa Properties and Lormax Stern Development will take on the new shopping center. Wal- Mart is building a super complex on 7 mile and Middlebelt Roads. Already the developers have some tenants who are interested in the new Livonia Mall though they are not releasing names. This new mall is smaller than the original, but the developers still anticipate it will bring back the shoppers. It will be a $60 million project with $25 million coming from Wal- Mart. The retail space is supposed to be completed in summer 2010."
"Mackinac Island Butterfly House","Michigan","Mackinac Island Butterfly House, Michigan, a World-Renowned Live-Butterfly House","The Mackinac Island Butterfly House is the third oldest live-butterfly house in the United States, and the first of its kind in Michigan. It's located behind the historic St. Anne's Church, just a few minutes walk from downtown in the direction of Mission Point Resort. The facility is 1800 square feet in size, and features a tropical garden filled with hundreds of live butterflies of every imaginable size and color from around the world. In this world-renowned facility, the garden display has been likened to a fairy tale,'' where the butterflies flutter, light and dance'' to the sounds of classical music and falling water. There's even a waterfall at the heart of the garden paradise, surrounded by fragrant blossoms. There are typically between 60 and 80 different species and about 800 butterflies total to be found in the garden at all times. One of the most popular species is the Blue Morpho, which is native to Costa Rica. The butterfly is identifiable by its bright, iridescent-blue coloring and fast, erratic flight. Another popular butterfly on display is the Blue Clipper, which is just one of the many species native to Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Members of this species can vary in color, including blue, green, brown, and orange, depending on the part of Asia from which they originate. Visitors may not realize it, but the butterfly exhibit undergoes constant change. Most adult butterflies live only 10-14 days, so 400 to 450 chrysalides - or nympha,'' which denotes the pupal stage of butterflies - must be purchased from butterfly farms in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe every week from April through September. The chrysalides are then cared for until the caterpillars inside transform into butterflies and emerge, and visitors may even have the opportunity to witness the event. After the new butterflies are able to fly, they are released into the garden. During the summer months, such releases of new butterflies take place several times a day. In addition to the live butterfly exhibit, the house also features Insect World, which displays a variety of mounted insects and live herps'' (another word for reptile or amphibian) from the world's tropical regions. Visitors can see such wonders as a 14-inch walking stick,'' giant beetles and spiders, grasshoppers, scorpions, and six-inch-long centipedes. The exhibit even lays claim as the current record holder for displaying the world's heaviest bug.'' Another feature attraction of Insect World is a large turtle pond, the home to several Red Eared Sliders, which are water turtles commonly found in the United States. Also on display is an Australian Bearded Dragon and two Blue Poison Dart Frogs from South America, as well as other reptiles and amphibians. For visitors who want to see more, Mackinac Island offers a number of historic buildings, biking, hiking, shopping, eating, horseback riding, and carriage rides. And Mackinac Island State Park, which encompasses 80 percent of the island, adds to the majestic geological wonders and visual treasures of the island that is considered sacred to the Ojibwa and Odawa Great Lakes Indian Tribes."
"Mackinac Island State Park","Michigan","Mackinac Island State Park, Michigan, the Second-Oldest National Park in the United States","Mackinac Island is located in the Straits of Mackinac, about seven miles east of the Mackinac Bridge. The island was first named a national park in 1875, making it the country's second-oldest behind only Yellowstone National Park. Today, more than 80 percent of the island is still part of the park and intact as a public preserve that's open year-round, free of charge. The Ojibwa and Odawa (Ottawa) Great Lakes Indian Tribes, who have visited Mackinac Island for more than 11,000 years, say this is where life began and hold the island as sacred. Visitors may well agree, as the island and the State Park provide a blend of breathtaking vistas, geological wonders and gems of history and nature - from lush forests, to high limestone bluffs, to sparkling water. The first thing visitors may notice is that, with the exception of government vehicles, automobiles are nowhere to be found on the island. They were banned more than 100 years ago, making for a quieter and cleaner way of life, as the park seeks to preserve and protect its woods, wildlife and natural wonders. Within the park, history is still being uncovered and discovered, and excavations have been carried out since the 1960s. In 1965, the University of Michigan Mackinac Island project excavated part of the Custer Road dump, which had been used by soldiers at Fort Mackinac. During our country's Revolutionary War, the fort was originally located in present day Mackinac City. It was manned by the British and named Fort Michilimackinac, until they closed it, renamed and relocated the fort to the island on a majestic bluff that towers 150 feet above the Straits of Mackinac. Over the course of the fort's history, it has been held by both British Redcoats and American soldiers. For a brief period during the War of 1812, the British retook the fort. Today, it serves as a living piece of history, where visitors can run their hands over wooden palisades, can still hear bugles, rifle retorts, cannon fire, and the tapping of Morse Cose. Visitors can even drill with soldiers, play a Victorian children's game, or dance to the beat of a 19th-century tune. Another park historical project took place in 2002, when the Wawashkamo Restoration and Preservation fund sponsored an archaeological survey of Wawashkamo Golf Course. The land was the site of the historic battle for Mackinac Island in 1814, and the survey was conducted by a team from the Center for Historic and Military Archaeology. The majority of Mackinac Island State Park is covered by lush forests and wildflowers. There are also a number of majestic natural limestone formations, such as Arch Rock, Sugar Loaf and Skull Cave. Arch Rock is particularly renowned, and is a source of much of the island's tourism. In the lore and superstitions of the Ottawa peoples, the rock is a bridge over which departed souls may pass. From a more scientific perspective, the rock is a 149-foot-tall limestone arch formed during the Nipissing post-glacial period. The State Park also features five historic buildings in the downtown area that allow visitors to further experience 18th-century French-Canadian and early American architecture and living."

The Masonic Order at first attempted to enlarge their current temple facility by purchasing land on either side of the structure, but by 1913 realized that the only solution was to purchase another site. Determined not to face the same problem in just a few years, the organization undertook a search and a building initiative that culminated in the purchase of land on Temple Street in downtown Detroit. Ground was broken for the Masonic Temple on Thanksgiving Day, 1920, and the cornerstone of the new Temple was laid on September 18, 1922, using the same tools that were used to lay the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol. The Temple was completed and dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1926, 30 years after the original Temple opened to the public. The Temple was built in three parts with three separate functions - the Ritualistic Tower, which houses the headquarters for most of the Masonic organizations in Detroit, the auditorium, which houses the theater and is intended for public use, and the Shrine Club. The center section of the Temple also houses public ballrooms and a Drill room which are used for conventions and events. The Detroit Masonic Temple is generally acknowledged to be one of the most complex and beautiful buildings in the United States. It consists of a 14 story Ritualistic Tower at one end, a 10 story Shrine Club at the other end, and between them, a 7 story Auditorium Building. The parts of the Temple include: Scottish Rite Cathedral, which seats 1,586 people The Drill Hall, a 17,500-foot hall that is used for conventions, trade shows and Roller Derby bouts A floating floor The Crystal Ballroom, which seats up to 900 people The Fountain Ballroom, which can seat 1,800 diners Five smaller dinner rooms, which are available for events The Masonic Temple has rooms and halls available for weddings, special events, conventions, trade shows and corporate events.

"Meridian Mall","Michigan","Meridian Mall, Okemos, MI","Okemos is a small suburb in Lansing, Michigan where the Meridian Mall can be found. This mall was opened in 1969 as a fully enclosed location. This same year a competitor mall was opened named Lansing Mall. Despite the competition Meridian Mall has managed to thrive, with over 125 stores and 5 anchor tenants. The current owners and management is through CBL and Associates Properties. CBL is one of the largest real estate and shopping development companies in the United States with more than 130 locations. When the mall was opened they had Woolco and Knapp's as the anchor tenants. There was also a four screen movie theater and supermarket. Over the years the space and the theater were redone to be the Meridian 4 West, and a third movie theater opened in the parking lot of the mall later on. Kmart, which closed in 1995, Best Buy and Meijer are some of the stores that were once at Meridian Mall. Knapp's closed in 1980, at all locations. JC Penney then moved in along with Hudson's. Woolco had to close in 1982, which allowed their space to be broken into a service merchandise catalog showroom, food court and more retail space. In 1987 the mall was expanded again to allow for Mervyn's. A year later, MC Sports moved into the center court area of the mall, which used to be home to an ice rink. The end of this decade marked more changes with the 4 West theater closing and Target opening nearby. Through the next decade shops opened and closed bringing in different options like bookstores and more. Today the anchors are JC Penney, Macy's and two Younkers locations. Other large tenants include Schuler Books and Music, Dick's Sporting Goods, Old Navy, and Bed Bath and Beyond. Not all of these stores are attached to the mall. Some are out parcel locations. The mall is over 970,000 square feet with 1 story, except in Younkers and Dick's who both have two floors. Mall hours of operation are Sunday noon to 6pm, Monday to Saturday 10am to 9pm. These hours can change based on holiday hours, and the department stores might have their own schedules. Events held at the mall occur annually such as Santa photos. Other store locations at Meridian Mall include A&R Fine Jewelry, Body Jewelry, Claire's, Personal Touch Body Jewelry, Sunglass Hut, Waist Land, Abercrombie, Children's Place, Gap Kids, Gymboree, Justice, Aeropostale, and American Eagle Outfitters.

Some of the restaurants are out parcel locations, meaning they are separate from the mall's main building. Other food choices include A to Z Snack Shop, Auntie Anne's, Dairy Queen, and Reed's Candy and Surf City Squeeze, which are spread throughout the mall."

"Michigan Historical Museum, Lansing, Michigan, Flagship of the Michigan Historical Museum System","Michigan","Michigan Historical Museum, Lansing, Michigan, Flagship of the Michigan Historical Museum System","The Michigan Historical Museum brings Michigan's history to life for visitors, from prehistoric times through the late twentieth century. Located in the Michigan Library and Historical Center in Lansing, the museum is the flagship of the Michigan Historical Museum System's 12 sites. The museum features five levels, twenty-six permanent galleries and a special exhibit gallery to convey the story of Michigan's past. Among its most striking visual features are a dramatic four-story atrium and a topographical relief map of the state that stands three stories high and greets visitors to the museum. The map also serves to inform and remind visitors of the natural forces and resources that have shaped the state's history, and to provide a background for stories about how Michigan's land and water have been used for industry, commerce and recreation. Some of the exhibits visitors to the musuem encounter include: The First People'' tells the story of the Paleo-Indian (ancient Indian'') peoples, who probably ventured into North America by crossing from Asia to Alaska via the Bering Straits. These Paleo-Indians traveled extensively and followed the herd animals they depended upon for food, skins and hides. They are believed to have arrived in Michigan about 12,000 years ago, where they hunted caribou, and possibly mammoths and mastodons as well, with spears. Settling a State'' showcases the story of Michigan's settlers and the state's early growth. Michigan became a territory'' in 1805 and a state in 1837, with Stevens T. Mason its first governor. During the period between 1830 and 1840, no state experienced faster growth than Michigan, thanks to access via the Erie Canal and the lure of cheap land. The Civil War gallery documents the story of the more than 90,000 Michigan men - including whites, Blacks and Native Americans - who served in the Civil War. As a strong anti-slavery state, Michigan responded quickly to the war, and the number of soldiers who served accounted for 23% of the state's male population. Though no Civil War battles took place on Michigan soil, these soldiers from infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and sharpshooter regiments fought in virtually every major battle of the war. The Mining gallery features an entrance with a towering mine headframe formed of timber, and a massive piece of float copper (copper that is found loose in the soil). Inside the gallery are exhibits about Michigan's copper and iron mining, other natural resources, as well as a history of the mining communities from the state's Upper Peninsula. The Lumbering exhibit document's Michigan's history as the nation's leading producer of lumber from 1869 to 1900. Michigan was noted for its virgin stands of white pine trees, which grew tall and straight-grained. The history also demonstrates how lumbering changed with the coming of the railroads, making it possible to cut trees far from rivers, which were the primary mode of transport prior to that. The Growing Up in Michigan, 1880-1895'' gallery showcases early life in the state, as seen through the eyes of five young people who grew up during the latter part of the 19th century. Visitors can examine actual diaries and reminiscences, and exhibits such as a one-room school house, living quarters and an outdoor shed. The Farm and Factory, 1860-1900'' exhibit shows how the predominantly rural state moved toward becoming industrialized. Via those and other exhibits, the Michigan Historical Museum brings to life in dramatic visual fashion the history of the state of Michigan."
"Michigan State Capitol, Lansing, Michigan, a National Historic Landmark and the Seat of Michigan's Government","Michigan","Michigan State Capitol, Lansing, Michigan, a National Historic Landmark and the Seat of Michigan's Government","The Michigan State Capitol building is a National Historic Landmark, and has served as the seat of Michigan's state government since the building was completed in 1878 at a cost of $1.2 million. The building was designed by Elijah E. Myers, and its successful completion established his reputation as the leading capitol-builder in the post-Civil War era and one of the country's most renowned architects of public facilities. Myers was one of the first architects to model his designs on the national capitol in Washington, D.C. His Neoclassical Renaissance'' - or Italianate'' - design for the Michigan Capitol set the standard for state capitols for decades. The name of his design is Tuebor, which translates to I will defend.'' The design also provided the inspiration for a national trend after the Civil War to fireproof buildings. The Capitol was contructed to not only house a state government that was growing in both complexity and size, but also to serve as a memento of the war itself. Once the building was dedicated and occupied, the interior embellishment continued over the course of several years. This embellisment included the extensive use of decorative and architectural painting, which was so elaborate and skillful that it still ranks as one of the finest examples of the Victorian decorative arts in the United States. From 1987 to 1992, the building underwent an extensive historical renovation. This included restoring the interior, along with its 139 rooms, and the exterior to their original appearance, as well as upgrading and adapting the building to serve as Michigan's permanent state capitol. The building is located at the intersection of Capitol and Michigan Avenues in Michigan's state capital, Lansing. At one time, the building was large enough to house the state's government agencies and departments. Now, the building houses only the legislative and executive branches of Michigan's state government, as well as the ceremonial offices of the state's governor and lieutenant governor. On the ground floor can be found several offices, such as the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House. The present building is the third to house the Michigan state government. The first state capitol was located in Detroit, which was the original capital of Michigan. The capital was relocated westward to Lansing in 1847 to be more defensible from Brittish troops stationed in Windsor, Ontario, and to develop the western portions of the state. The Capitol building stands 267 feet from the ground to the tip of the spire atop its dome, and is 420 feet, two inches long and 273 feet and 11 inches wide, including its approaches. The Capitol occupies 1.167 acres and has a perimeter of 1,520 feet. There are four stories, two grand staircases in the north and south corridors that go to the top floor. Two of the most distinctive characteristics of the Capitol are its dome (inside and out), and the statue of Civil War Governor Austin Blair that greets visitors at the front of the building. Blair was a Michigan politican who strongly opposed slavery and secession, and a champion of human rights, the effort to ban capital punishment, and the efforts to give women and Black citizens the right to vote. The exterior dome originally matched the light tan color of the building, but was repainted a bright white during the building's renovation. On the inside, the cast-iron dome presides over the eight muses on the ceiling display. On the north wall of the first floor resides a large clock, known as a long-drop clock.'' The clock is at least as old as the building itself, and was restored to working condition in 1990. Another of the building's noteworthy features is its cornerstone, which has the date 1872 on one side and 1878 on the other, marking the start of construction and the building's completion. On the grounds nearby can be found the state tree of Michigan, an Eastern White Pine, a blue spruce called The Freedom Tree'' in memorial to the Vietnam War's MIAs and POWs, and the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. tree planted in memory of Martin Luther King, Jr."
"Michigan's Adventure","Michigan","Michigan's Adventure - Muskegon, Michigan - large amusement part in western Michigan","Originally called Deer Park, Michigan's Adventure opened in 1956 with a number of carnival rides and games. Today, the park has over 50 rides, including seven roller coasters. The park is actually two in one - along with the regular amusement parks, there is also a section with water rides called WildWater Adventure. Michigan's Adventure is owned and operated by Cedar Fair, the same company who owns Cedar Point. The roller coasters are a main attraction to the park. One of the most popular is the Corkscrew, which opened in 1979 as one of the most popular roller coasters in the United States. The corkscrew has two inversions, and reaches speeds of 45 miles per hour. There's also Zach's Zoomer, a wooden roller coaster for children, as well as Wolverine Wildcat, a wooden roller coaster that has a track that goes through a dark tunnel and reaches speeds of up to 55 miles per hour. Thunderhawk, opened in 2008, became the first suspended looping roller coaster in Michigan, and this coaster takes riders on five loops and drops them 85 feet. In 1999, Michigan's Adventure also opened a wild mouse style coaster called Mad Mouse, as well as the Big Dipper, a steel coaster for families. The park's flagship roller coaster, however, is called Shivering Timbers. This wooden coaster opened in 1998 and reaches speeds of up to 65 miles per hour. There are a number of drops during this ride, and is it currently the only roller coaster in the world that has a trick track,'' which throws riders from side to side, not just up and down. There's also a large percentage of airtime on the long ride. After the park opened Shivering Timbers, it was given a number of awards. Since then, it has been ranked as one of the best wooden roller coasters in the United States. Michigan's Adventure has a number of non-coaster rides as well. At the amusement park, guests can find airplanes, a carousel, bumper cars, a flying elephant ride, a flying trapeze, go-karts, motorcycles, and more.

"Model T Automotive Heritage Complex","Michigan","Model T Automotive Heritage Complex - Detroit, Michigan - historical automobile-themed complex","Detroit has long been known as a major center for car manufacturing and one of the best places in the city to get an idea of the important role the city played is to visit the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex, or T-Plex. The building was threatened with demolition when local zoning laws changed, until in 1997 preservationist Jerald Mitchell stepped in, thus ensuring its survival. Henry Ford was born just outside Detroit in 1863 and after becoming skilled at the repair of steam engines, developed a self-propelled vehicle in 1896. Ford formed his own company in 1901 and began to not only build cars, but also revolutionize the industrial world by paying his workers a fair wage. Ford's company purchased the building in 1904 and the famous Model T was introduced in 1908. Over the course of almost 20 years, over 15 million Model T Fords would be sold. In 2006, the plant was designated as a National Historic Landmark; the building is also a Michigan Historic site. Work continues constantly in an effort to restore and renovate as much of the building as possible - much of it done by volunteers. Almost a dozen committees are involved not only with restoration, but everything from loaning out cars to publishing a regular newsletter. The distinctive red brick building still retains many of its original fittings and details from the period, including windows and fire escapes. At the time of its construction, the building was an excellent example of efficient industrial construction. Ford introduced various measures aimed at preventing fire damage, including three firewalls and a 25,000-gallon water tank that fed a sprinkler system. But it is what is inside the building that attracts history buffs and car enthusiasts - in addition to a collection of Model T Ford cars, visitors also see the once secret and experimental room where the Model T was developed. Several other Ford cars were constructed here as well, including the underrated Ford Model N and the model K, considered a luxury car at the time. In addition to several intact cars, visitors to T-Plex also experience a unique look at how cars were made over a century ago. A major exhibit shows the famous Model T car during different stages of its assembly and explains how cars were manufactured before the invention of the moving assembly line. Other exhibits in the building tell the history of both the building and the autoworkers. The T-Plex complex is located in an area of Detroit that is also home to several other reminders of the city's importance in the car industry. During its heyday, the Piquette Avenue area was the home of the US auto industry and in addition to the T-Plex building there are several other fine examples of industrial buildings that were once the home of such well known names as Cadillac, Dodge and Studebaker. There are also several sites relating to Henry Ford in and around Detroit, including the Henry Ford Museum in the nearby suburb of Dearborn."
"Moross House","Michigan","Moross House, Detroit, Michigan","In Detroit, Michigan there are a number of homes and businesses that have been around for more than a century. One particular place for residents and visitors to enjoy is the Moross House. This house is the oldest surviving brick home in Detroit. This factor alone is what places it on the National Register of Historic Places. It received this distinction in 1972. There are conflicting accounts as to when the house was actually built. Some believe the house was constructed in the 1840's by Christopher Moross, while others put it at 1855. Whether the 1840's is right or not, the house has been opened as a museum, with furniture and decorations based on the 1840's rather than the next decade. The house changed ownership throughout the many decades, eventually being purchased by the Detroit Historical Commission in the 1920's. It was restored in 1971 to 1973 to be opened up for visitors. It is also the current home of the Detroit Garden Center. The Garden Center is a non-profit organization. It provides tours of the house, the parlor and hallway. The people running the tours also offer education on garden activities. They focus on educating people regarding gardening, flowers, and the 1840's. There is a tour of the facility and the small garden area the Center has planted. At Christmas there are special open houses to show the old fashioned Christmas theme. The decorations are all relevant to the 1840's. The house is also open in February for an orchid display with a lecture and sale of the plants. The Moross House can be described as a three bay structure, much like a townhouse. It was built in the Federal Style when the Greek Revival was occurring. This means much of the house details are in the Greek Revival style. There are heavy stone lintels and sidelights. This works to transform the front of the house. The building is two stories in height with a river limestone foundation. The roof has parapets and is covered with wood shingles. The shingles have had to be replaced over the last century to keep it looking good and to keep rain damage to a minimum. The wood shingles are ordered to look like the originals. There are also two chimneys on the roof that offer a symmetrical appearance. On the rear of the house is a single story addition and one on the side of the house as well. The Anthropology Museum of Detroit did some work in 1969 with the Moross House. On a dig they excavated a couple of areas. During this period any materials found were excavated and taken to the museum where they are on display. The collection from the backyard provides a number of clues to the early history including how the land was used as a dump by those demolishing the neighboring home. Ceramics, clay pipe fragments, and porcelain items were found during the dig. Also Earthenware, Blue Edgeware, and Mochaware were found with the excavation of the land."

"Motown Historical Museum","Michigan","Motown Historical Museum - Detroit, MI - museum honoring the history of Motown music","Founded in 1985, the Motown Historical Museum celebrates the legacy of the Motown Record Corporation and its impact on United States culture during the 1960s. This museum is located in Detroit and attracts thousands of visitors every year. From the opening of Studio A to the innovative style of the Motown women, the Motown Historical Museum gives tourists exhibits on everything dealing with this musical style. Motown's story begins in 1959 when Berry Gordy, Jr. purchased a two- family flat in Detroit and called it Hitsville USA. Today, that flat is the basis of the museum. Visitors can see the home as it looked in 1959-1960, with the original master bedroom suite and living room furniture. While Motown was first getting off of the ground, their producers, musicians, and administrators sat around the dining room table to prepare records for shipping. Along with this table, visitors to the Motown Historical Museum can see the original Motown control room, which was used to record Motown Sound. Some of the songs recorded on this equipment include Shop Around'' and Please Mr. Postman.'' Even after Motown outgrew its Hitsville USA headquarters and moved to a larger building, some of its recording artists continued to make records in this studio. As Motown grew in popularity, so did the space they needed. Gordy and his family moved, and the company purchased 7 more houses in the neighborhood for their singers, songwriters, producers, and other employees. The Motown Historical Museum includes models of these buildings, which they used exclusively until moving to a high rise in downtown Detroit. Along with the equipment used to make this company one of the most successful record labels in history, tourists can see the original stage uniforms that were worn by some of Motown's biggest stars. In the exhibit Motown Style,'' the museum displays Michael Jackson's famous jeweled white glove and fedora, dresses worn by the Supremes, and outfits that were once designed for Brenda Holloway, among other costumes. Further memorabilia found at the Motown Historical Museum includes original sheet music, photos of Motown's stars in the recording studio, and promotional material from the early 1960s. One of the most innovative recording methods during this time was the use of Motown's Echo Room. When visiting the Motown Historical Museum, guests can play with the special effects processes used before electronics could manipulate the music. They used a hole in the ceiling to create reverb, as heard in songs such as Dancing in the Streets'' and Where Did Our Love Go,'' and today's tourists can sing and clap in this studio to get similar effects. Visitors to the Motown Historical Museum can view the exhibits themselves or participate in a guided tour. The museum offers tours regularly during normal hours, and larger groups can schedule private tours in advance. As this is a popular destination for all age groups, the museum also offers special tours for school classes, church organizations, family reunions, and other groups. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with hours on Monday as well during July and August.

"Music House Museum, Traverse City, Michigan, a Showcase of Some of the Finest and Rarest Automated Musical Instruments","Michigan","Music House Museum, Traverse City, Michigan, a Showcase of Some of the Finest and Rarest Automated Musical Instruments","Among the rural cherry orchards of Acme, Michigan, eight miles north of Traverse City, can be found a renovated 12,000-square-foot white barn and historical attraction known as the Music House Museum. The museum houses an extensive collection of some of the finest and rarest automated musical instruments, showcased in authentic, turn-of-the-century settings. The collection has been meticulously restored and the instruments still play, bringing to life some of the greatest musical artists of the past. The museum's showcase items include a 1924 Wurlitzer Theater Organ and a 97-key Mortimer Dance Organ, built in Antwerp in 1922. There are also antique music boxes and jukeboxes, air-powered music machines, phonographs, nickelodeons, church organs, and radios on display. The one-hour tour is also highlighted by a boisterous demonstration of the Amaryllis - a 30-foot-wide, 18-foot-tall automated organ that once entertained guests in the 1920s at the Victoria Palace ballroom in Ypres, Belgium. The rare, ornate organ makes use of dozens of specially tuned organ pipes and percussion instruments to recreate the sounds of a large European orchestra. In addition, the museum also features re-creations of a general store, saloon and lyric theater. And an exhibit known as the Traverse Model City makes use of scale models to showcase some of the buildings that existed in Traverse City in the 1930s. There are also special exhibits and events, such as the silent films The Blacksmith, along with Seven Chances, The Navigator, and Cops, which all star Buster Keaton, and The Tramp, starring Charlie Chaplain.

"New Detroit Science Center","Michigan","New Detroit Science Center - Detroit, MI - science and technology learning center and museum","Home to the state's only IMAX Dome Theatre, the New Detroit Science Center is located in Detroit's Cultural Center, an area that includes a number of museums, libraries, and other places of interest. Visitors of all ages can participate in hands-on experiments, see live demonstrations, and learn more about the world of science at this museum. Michigan philanthropist Dexter Ferry founded the New Detroit Science Center in the 1970s. He believed that children in Detroit deserved the same opportunities as children in other major cities, but there were no major science centers in the area. In 1970, he opened a small center in an old car dealership building, and construction began on an official center in 1976. They shut down for nearly two years for major renovations, and since reopening in 2001, they've have over a million visitors. Today, one of the highlights of the New Detroit Science Center is the IMAX Dome, which was originally called an Omnimax. When it was constructed in 1976, it was only the second of its kind to ever be built n the United States. The dome is over 67 feet in diameter, and films on this screen have a unique 3-dimensional effect. The New Detroit Science Center has over 110,00 square feet of exhibits, labs, and other learning opportunities. In addition to the IMAX Dome, they have a digital planetarium, a hall for temporary exhibits, and number of theatres and stages. They have five main exhibit laboratories where guests can see demonstrations and participate in science experiments - the General Motors Motion Laboratory, the Waves and Vibrations Laboratory, the Matter and Energy Laboratory, the Dow Foundation Life Sciences Laboratory, and the SBC Children's Gallery. The learning center also has a children's center called Kids Town,'' which is a permanent exploration center for younger guests. Catering to children ages five and under, Kids Town has a play kitchen where kids can learn about mixtures, as well as areas for them to crawl and play while learning about the laws of nature. Kids Town adheres to guidelines set by the Michigan Board of Education for pre-kindergarten and early childhood learning, and they run a number of programs throughout the year to foster excitement about science in children. One of the most popular attractions at the New Detroit Science Center is their Dassault Systemes Planetarium. This three-story-high dome uses digital technology to allow the museum's experts to move the star field as you'd see in nature, rather than providing guests with just a traditional fixed view of the sky. They also provide show kits for some of their productions, which include slides, soundtracks, education materials, and other items to help children continue learning at home or in the classroom. The New Detroit Science Center is open seven days a week, with weekday hours from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM and weekend hours from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. General admission tickets are available at a number of price points, depending on what guests intended to do while at the learning center, and they have membership options available, which include free admission for a year with your contribution. Visitors can learn more by calling 313-577-8400."
"Nichols Arboretum, Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Grandeur and Serenity of Nature","Michigan","Nichols Arboretum, Ann Arbor, Michigan, the Grandeur and Serenity of Nature","Nichols Arboretum is a nature preserve in the Ann Arbor area, established in 1907 just a few blocks from the University of Michigan's Central Campus. Today, the park stretches along one side of the university campus, and has grown to 123 acres, where people come to jog, picnic, stroll, or simply take in one of the most scenic vistas in the region. It is believed that the renowned poet Robert Frost - a resident of Ann Arbor in the 1920s - based his poem The Road Not Taken'' on this serene area. The Arboretum features a 10-acre restored prairie, more than a mile of frontage on the Huron River, a lilac collection, and more than 500 wood plant species. There are also micro habitats which include the Peony Garden (which features the oldest peony collection in the country), Magnolia Cove, Appalachian Glen, and extensive stretches of both native and exotic trees and shrubs. The terrain, carved by glaciers many thousands of years earlier, dips as much as 180 feet as it slopes toward the river, making for a complex topography that includes intimate dales and glens, as well as vast panoramas and broad valleys. Wildlife thrives in the area, and creatures such as woodpeckers, bats and nocturnal flying squirrels make it their home The Arb,'' as it's called locally, offers a number of displays, natural areas, trails/pathways, and exhibits to keep visitors entertained. One such trek is the Clean Water Trail - a self-guided tour in School Girls' Glen and throughout Nichols Arboretum. The trail showcases an erosion control project that attempts to reverse water damage and soil erosion that has occurred throughout the years. Over time, fast-moving water from urban runoff has undercut stream banks, leading to a destabilization of the Glen's slopes. Large trees have been felled and much of the hillside has been washed away with them. It is estimated that an average of one cubic yard of soil has been washed from School Girls' Glen into the Huron River every day for the last 35 years! The project uses what are known as biotechnical erosion control methods'' - i.e., natural, strutural materials, such as plants and boulders - to stabilize the slopes and help prevent further erosion. Another of the Arb's showcase tours follows Laurel Ridge Trail, which provides visitors with both a beautiful experience and a powerful message. That message is a simple one: that azaleas and rhododendrons will thrive if their needs are met. By allowing an old pine stand to provide the acidic soil such shrubs require, combined with the protection from winter sunburn that the northerly slope provides, a beautiful bloom of colors and fragrances results. The azaleas (deciduous rhododendron) bloom predominantly in May, while the evergreen shrubs, which are also hybrid rhododendrons, bloom in late May to June. In addition to such natural wonders, the Arb also features visual and performing-art exhibits, combined with creative activities to help visitors perceive, interact with, and understand the artists' messages. Shakespeare also makes his yearly appearance in the Arb for several weeks every June. During that time, both the players and the audience move throughout the Arb, so that scenes may be acted and viewed in the best settings. The Arb is truly the road not taken,'' and a source of nature's grandeur and serenity amid the hustle of city and university life."
"Northland Center","Michigan","Northland Center, Southfield, MI","Despite the town's name of Southfield in Michigan, the mall is called Northland Center. Southfield is a suburb of Detroit. Northland Center is one of the oldest malls in the state of Michigan, having been built in 1954. Construction on the center actually began in 1952, taking two years for the 2,000,000 square foot retail floor space and 1 floor building to be completed. JC Penney had two floors, with Macy having 4 floors, but the rest of the mall is all on one. The developer of the mall was JL Hudson Company, with management Jones Lang LaSalle. Northland was considered a great achievement for regional shopping during the Post War period. The design originally included a four level Hudson's with a ring of stores around it, hence Macy's four floors today. The mall was open air in the 50's until the 1970's. At this time expansion and closure of the mall created an indoor locale. About 100 tenants inhabit the mall now. When Hudson's merged with Dayton's the store was rebranded. They were eventually to become part of Target, with a rebranding of Marshall Field's in 2001. Eventually Macy's picked up the brand name. May Department Stores, Big Boy, Hughes and Hatcher, Kresge, Kroger, Sanders, and other stores were part of the early mall. Most of these places have closed though. Northland was an architectural delight with an auditorium, bank, post office, infirmary, sculptures, fountains, and landscaping that made it look unique and beautiful all at the same time. It still has a quaint beauty, which has changed during the years of renovations. Today Macy's and Target are the only anchors as TJ Maxx, National Wholesale Liquidators, and JC Penney stores remain vacant. The mall is now owned by Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp. Mall Hours will differ based on the holiday season; however, normal hours are Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm, and noon to 5pm on Sunday. For holidays the mall usually closes early. Events during the year are held at the mall like photos with Santa. Sales events also occur throughout the year. The stores are varied and perfect for any shopper's budget. Some of the store locations include Abilities Pathway, Action Master, Arto's Jewelry, Ashley Stewart, Athlete's Foot, Bakers, Baskets and Gifts, Beautiful Eyebrows, Bhogalli Leather, Brick House Designs, Buckle Creations, C'est La Vie, Champs Sports, Citi Wear, and City Hatter. Other options are City Slicker Shoes, Couture Elegance, Craftsman Jewelers, Creative Tee's Air Brushing, Cynosure, and Dazzle and Glamour. Detroit Gator, Doll House Boutique, Euro Touch Gold and Silver, Finish Line, Foot Locker, Forever Young, Funtyme Toys, and GNC are a few of the other locations offered at Northland Center. Among the various shops are specialty stores and the food court. One can eat at Auntie Anne's, Otto's Crispy Corn, Subway, A&W, Flaming Wok, UMI Oriental N Cajun, and others. Some of the restaurants are not housed in the mall, but as out parcel locations nearby. There are plenty of choices for shoppers in the food department."
"Oakland Mall","Michigan","Oakland Mall, Troy, MI","Oakland Mall located in Troy, Michigan was built in 1965. Troy is a suburb of Detroit, where the mall is at I75 and 14 mile Road. The mall has 120 stores with a food court and several anchor locations. The mall is 1,500,000 square feet of indoor space with one floor except in JC Penney and two wing anchors. The mall is currently owned by Urban Retail Properties. At the time the mall was opened Sears was the only anchor mall. Three years later Hudson's, Wrigley Supermarket, and Kresge moved in. The supermarket was converted into JC Penney in the 1970's before being torn down in 1980 for expansion. The new wing allowed JC Penney to have two stories rather than the one it had before. Along with the new wing a movie theater was built. Kresge closed allowing for the space to be converted into small retail spaces. It took until 1990 for a food court to be added to the mall. Before this only Burger King and Godfather's Pizza were at the mall. Borders bookstore opened in the late 90's. The theater did not survive the next decade, closing in 2000 for a conversion to Steve and Barry's. Hudson's, like many of their stores became Marshall Field's before turning into Macy's. Lord and Taylor was a proposal store, but never actually became an anchor. The center's hours are Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm and Sunday 11pm to 6pm. Holiday hours can vary the store hours. Most often the stores will close around 5pm before a holiday or on a holiday. The department stores can have their own hours. The mall also hosts events like photos with Santa and numerous sales events throughout the year. Today the surviving anchor stores are JC Penney, Macy's and Sears.

"Old St. Mary's Church","Michigan","Old St. Mary's Church - Detroit, Michigan - one of the oldest churches in Detroit","Nestled in the shadow of the towering skyscrapers of downtown Detroit, Old St. Mary's Catholic Church provides a peaceful retreat for both worshippers and tourists alike. The parish from which the church takes its name is the third oldest in Detroit and was founded in 1834 by Catholic immigrants from Neustadt, Germany. Its full name is St. Mary Roman Catholic Church, although most residents today simply refer to it as Old St. Mary's. In 1840, the founder of the parish, Father Martin Kundig was authorized to begin fund raising for a new church; and in 1841, a plot of land that was to be the site of the church was purchased for just one dollar. The cornerstone was laid the following year and the church's construction was overseen by Father Otto Skolla, replacing Father Kundig who had unfortunately suffered a nervous breakdown. From the beginning, construction of St. Mary's was a team effort. Many of the almost 100,000 bricks used were carried to the construction site by women of the parish; a local resident Antoine Beaubien donated the tower's four bells. Even the children of St. Mary's parish weren't forgotten - balconies were installed in several parts of the church, in order to seat the local children. In 1884, construction began on a new church to replace the older structure, under the supervision of Father Appolinaris Hattler. The new building was designed in the Roman style, although the design also contains elements of Venetian Renaissance and Pisan Romanesque. At the time of its construction, the steeple on Old St. Mary's was visible from miles around; today, despite the proliferation of taller buildings, it is still a major landmark in the city. The interior of the church is just as beautiful as the exterior. Much of the inside has been decorated in different shades of blue, creating a calm and relaxing atmosphere. One of the highlights is the beautiful 90 feet high ceiling, with its elaborate frescoes and bright colors of blue and orange. The beautiful granite columns were originally intended to be used in the state capitol building. The church's Stations of the Cross date from 1907 and are all carved from wood. Old St. Mary's prides itself on not only the quality of its music, but on its excellent acoustics and throughout its history has gained a well-deserved reputation for choral singing. One of the highlights of the Christmas and Easter seasons is the chance to enjoy the choir performing orchestral masses. The church's present organ dates from 1928 and is sister organ to the one in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. Old St. Mary's Church is conveniently located a short distance east of downtown Detroit and is just off I-375 in the area of Detroit known as Greektown. As the name suggests, this part of the city was settled during the 18th and 19th centuries by Greek immigrants and it's a good chance to sample some traditional Greek food before or after a visit to the church."
"Oval Beach, Saugatuck, Michigan, One of the Best Beaches and Shorelines in the World","Michigan","Oval Beach, Saugatuck, Michigan, One of the Best Beaches and Shorelines in the World","Oval Beach in Saugatuck, Michigan has been rated by Cond, Nast Traveler as one of the 25 best shorelines in the world, while MTV has it ranked as one of the country's top five beaches. National Geographic Traveler takes it a step further, rating it as one of the top two freshwater beaches in the country. Those rankings come thanks to the area's combination of towering sand dunes, white sand beach, beautiful views, seclusion, and services, such as life guards and concessions. Oval beach can best be reached via North America's only hand-pulled chain ferry boat, which crosses the Kalamazoo River from nearby Saugatuck. A climb of 282 steps then takes visitors to Mount Baldhead, where they are rewarded with a splendid view of the harbor and Lake Michigan. From there, visitors descend onto the grassy coastal sands and the stunning shoreline. Along with the customary beach activities of swimming and sunbathing, visitors can also take a freewheeling ride on the dune schooner'' - a converted pickup truck that traverses some of the towering nearby sand hills. Visitors can also book some time on an old-fashioned sternwheeler shuttle that tours the river and the Lake Michigan shoreline, taking in a variety of sights, such as lavish area homes and cottages, wetlands, forests, and dunes, as well as the Ghost Town of Singapore that now lies buried near the mouth of the Kalamazoo River. There's also a WWII Duck'' that provides ferry service between the towns of Saugatuck and Douglas. Biking, hiking, strolling a winding boardwalk, and picnicking are also popular local activities, and there are a number of scenic city parks adorned by Victorian-style gazebos along the riverside. That makes the setting ideal for simply relaxing or watching some of the port's 900 yachts and sailboats glide by. The area is also a haven for anglers, who can charter boats in search of salmon, pike, trout, and perch. And anyone who wants to make a bigger splash can rent anything from kayaks, to jet skis, to sailboats and yachts. Horseback riding and equestrian training are also available in the area. Midwest Living magazine ranked the Saugatuck-Douglas area #5 on its 2007 list of Best Small-Town Getaways, and the two towns provide a variety of sights, shopping and activities for visitors. Together, they are known as The Art Coast of Michigan,'' thanks to the number of artists who have taken up residence and operate studios and galleries in the area. In addition to such small-town, rural charm, visitors will also find a number of unique shops, fine dining and lodging, professional summer theater, jazz music, and some outstanding golfing, including an 18-hole championship course designed by Arnold Palmer. In Douglas, history buffs can take a tour of a floating, maritime museum, the S.S. Keewatin - a 350-foot passenger steamship once sailed the Great Lakes - or visit the award-winning Historical Museum for a look back in time at the area's earliest settlers. The Saugatuck Dunes State Park and the Allegan State Forest are also nearby, as well as a tour of a local vineyard. The area is vintage, small-town Americas at its best - a combination of scenic, beautiful beaches, 19th-century architecture, and 21st-century shops and activities."

A great attraction for kids, in particular, is the zoo's Barnyard and petting zoo. The Barnyard features a number of exotic animals, such as pygmy goats from Africa, yaks, burros, Saanen goats from Switzerland, toy China pigs, giant Aldabra tortoises, and even reindeer. The zoo also offers a Bird & Reptile House with more exotic creatures, such as Emerald Tree Snakes, Gila Monsters, Boas, the endagered Bali Mynah bird, Macaws, and owls. There are only a few dozen of the Bali Mynah birds still in existence, and the Potter Park Zoo is attempting to breed a pair of the birds to help prevent their extinction. The park also features a Feline/Primate House, which was originally built in 1930 and renovated in 1989. This building houses some of the zoo's most remarkable animals, such as its two Siberian Tigers, also known as Amur Tigers. The house also features Snow Leopards, two species of Lemurs, Mandrills (closely related to baboons), African Lions, the endangered Cotton Top Tamarin monkeys and Golden Lion Tamarin monkeys, which are on loan to the zoo from the Brazilian government. The park also features the Wolf Woods, which simulates an adventure into the wild woodlands of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Canada. A log cabin with a large picture window allows visitors to see an exhibit of endangered Eastern Timber Wolves, and also view a variety of wildlife artifacts. The park also has a Coral Reef Exhibit, where visitors can enter an oceanic world. The exhibit features living reefs, exotic, rainbow-colored fish, crustaceans, eels, shrimp, living corals, and even sunken ships. One of the more scenic and relaxing areas of the park is its Duck Pond, where ducks, swans, and geese enjoy their watery habitat and children can feed them. There are even a few pelicans, and deer can sometimes be seen grazing in the meadows beyond. The beatifically landscaped Backyard Gardens provide an area for both strolling, reflection and education. There are also educational signs along the way to tell visitors how they can transform their own backyards into areas that can attract wildlife, birds and butterflies. Another attraction of the park is its Education Center, opened in 2000. The facility includes the Safari Room for meetings, classrooms, a special exhibit room for temporary wildlife presentations, as well as offices. In addition, the park offers special tours and educational programs, such as: Sensational Zoo'' teaches visitors about how animals see, hear, smell, taste, touch, and survive in the wild. Fur, Feather, Scales & Slime'' explains why some animals have fur while others have feathers or scales and slime. Animals in Winter'' shows visitors how animals not only prepare for winter, but use their coats, fat deposition, hibernation, and migration to survive in the cold. What's for Lunch'' demonstrates strategies animals in the wild use for either catching their next meal...or avoiding being something's dinner, via camouflage, stalking techniques, etc. The Last Ark'' explains how zoos are not only fun places to see and learn about wild animals; they're also becoming the last hope of survival for many endangered species. The park also offers two very popular activities: pony and camel rides during the summer and early fall, which provide a fun ride for the kids and some great photo opportunities for parents."
"Potter Park Zoological Gardens","Michigan","Potter Park Zoological Gardens - Lansing, Michigan - zoo and garden covering over 60 acres","In 1915, J.W. and Sarah Potter donated nearly 60 acres of land to the city of Lansing for a new park. They added another 27 acres in 1917 and got their first animals in 1920. The zoo began to grow with the addition of lions, monkeys, and other animals, and they added an aviary in 1949. Over the years, more and more visitors have come to the Potter Park Zoological Gardens every year, and they've added more animal species to their ever-growing collection. A number of the exhibits at the Potter Park Zoological Gardens are in large houses and other indoor enclosures, so guests can visit the zoo even during inclement weather. The Bird and Reptile House is especially popular, with emerald tree snakes, gila monsters, owls, boas, macaws, and a number of other animals. The zoo's Bird and Reptile House is home to a pair of Bali Mynah birds, one of the most rare animals in the world. Researchers believe that there are just a few dozen of these birds still in existence, so zoos like this one are attempting to breed these birds and bring them back from the edge of extinction. The Feline and Primate Building is found nearby. The structure was originally built in 1930, and it housed the zoo's lions. In 1989, it was expanded and renovated to hold both big cats and primates. Some of the species found in this facility include Amer (Siberian) tigers, snow leopards, lemurs, lions, tamarins, and mandrills.

"Red Hawk Golf Course","Michigan","Red Hawk Golf Course, East Tawas, Michigan - A Northern Michigan Golf Course in the Tradition and Style of the 1920s and 30s","Red Hawk Golf Course is an Arthur Hills design set amid 205 acres the Huron National Forest in Northern Michigan. The course, which opened in 1999, is situated in a valley and features many of the hallmarks of Northern Michigan golf, such as natural ridges, ravines, valleys, wetlands and an abundance of trees. Towering pine, oak, maple, birch and beech trees line the fairways and provide both a challenge and a dramatic backdrop. One course feature that tends to surprise golfers is the elevation change found on a course on the east side of the state, an area not typically known for it. Hole No. 3, for example, features an elevation drop of 63 feet from tee to green, and the green is perched above Fountain Creek farther below. The 18-hole, par-71 public course plays to 6,589 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 71.6 and a slope rating of 139. It's a relatively short course, with the White tees playing to only 5,676 yards. The challenge comes from the rolling landscape and undulating greens that feature subtle, yet deceptive, breaks. The landing areas are not as tight as they might appear off the tee, and bunkering on the course is minimal, but has been described as magnificent. When taken all together, the course is a classic design that is said to mirror the great courses designed in the 1920s and 30s. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 2, a short par-4 that plays to only 292 yards from the back tees, and a mere 262 from the Whites. Golfers thinking of driving the green may think twice, however, as the hole features seven bunkers, the most of any on the course. The fairway and green are both elevated, guarded on the left by dense trees and the right by deep bunkers. Hole No. 11 is a scenic and demanding par-5 that plays to 509 yards from the back tees and 486 from the Gold. Tee shots should easily carry the large pond just in front and find the large uphill landing area, but it's what comes next that makes this hole tricky. The hole doglegs left from there, and the green is two-tiered and severely slopes from the front to the back. The course has accumulated a number of awards since its opening, including being ranked #40 by Golf Digest in 2007 among the Top Public Golf Courses in America. And Great Lakes Golf Magazine rated Red Hawk the #3 Public Golf Course in Michigan in 2003. Practice facilities at Red Hawk are some of the finest in Northeastern Michigan, and include a driving range with two tiers. The same Bent grass as found on the course is used on the teeing area and the practice fairway. There are also four target greens complete with bunkers. There's also a short-game practice area, with Bent grass green and practice sand bunker, along with another 7,000-square-foot putting green. Lessons are also available. Red Hawk also features a clubhouse with a fully stocked pro shop, as well as the Red Hawk Grill for dining."

"Shepherd's Hollow Golf Course (2nd & 3rd Courses)","Michigan","Shepherd's Hollow Golf Course (2nd & 3rd Courses), Clarkston, Michigan An Upscale Northern Michigan Golf Experience Just North of Detroit","Shepherd's Hollow Golf Course is located just 30 miles north of Detroit, yet provides the layout and terrain that will have golfers thinking they're playing an upscale course in Northern Michigan. The course plays through 350 acres of wooded, rolling land that's been called by renowned golf course architect Arthur Hills as good a piece of inland property as one has ever seen for a golf course.'' The course opened with 18 holes in 2000, and has since expanded to 27 holes, with the 2nd and 3rd nines considered the best combination. There was actually enough land available to build 36 holes, but developers wanted to keep the holes far enough apart to provide some privacy and add to the feeling of seclusion often found on courses far to the north. The course also features wide, undulating fairways that play through a mix of hardwood trees, ridges, and valleys, with 160 feet of elevation change throughout. Four ponds also come into play, but don't dominate the course. The course also features a unique bunker style, with sand higher on the faces, that's different from any other Arthur Hills course and provides a distinctive look amid all the trees. Each of the nines plays to at least 3,585 yards, with the par-72 Shepherd's Hollow 2 and 3 combination playing to 7,235 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 76.1 and a slope rating of 144. There are five sets of tees from which to choose, and the course plays to only 6,116 yards from the Whites. It's been said that no two holes are alike on this course, and some of the more noteworthy holes include Hole No. 13. This hole is both scenic and challenging, a par-5 that plays to 565 yards from the back tees and is the #2-handicap hole. The tee shot must carry the large pond just beyond the tee box, then contend with four bunkers that guard the right side of the fairway. Ideally, second shots should reach a plateau 100 yards short of the green, while approach shots will have to be wary of more bunkers along the way. Hole No. 18 is similar, another par-5 that plays to 564 yards from the tips and ranks as the #1-handicap hole. From the tee box, golfers will see a long fairway that slopes left-to-right toward seven bunkers that guard the right side. Second shots will then have to contend with a large pond as the fairway wraps around it, while approach shots will take aim at a multi-tiered green tucked right behind the water hazard and guarded by four more bunkers at the back. Since opening, Shepherd's Hollow has received raves from golf critics and players, and is now considered the King of Metro Detroit golf courses.'' Golf Digest also recently ranked it as the 37th best public golf course in the country. Practice facilities at Shepherd's Hollow include a full-service driving range and short-game practice area. Lessons are also available and there's a fully stocked golf shop. The course also features an elegant clubhouse, and the dining experience has been called second-to-none''."

This is perhaps one of the most intricately developed malls in Michigan. It has numerous floors with glass windows, elevators, and much more. The mall was developed by The Forbes Company and they still own it. The mall first opened in 1969 as Somerset Mall. In 1992 and 1996 Somerset South and Somerset North were built.

Annual sales are about $600 million for the Somerset Collection. In 1967, Saks Fifth Avenue built a store on Big Beaver Road. This led to the idea of an indoor mall, which is why Somerset Mall was built with Saks as the anchor. The other anchor was Bonwit Teller. Bonwit had to close in 1990 due to bankruptcy issues. Their space was reduced to rubble in 1992 in order for Neiman Marcus to have a newer location. Tiffany's also joined in the mall at this time. Numerous stores opened during this period in the 90's like Nordstrom and Macy to add on to the mall. The expansion not only allowed for more stores but an update in architecture. Inside is an amazing fountain with four statues and a moving sidewalk. The grand court has a glass dome roof with arched glass like the Mall at Millenia in Orlando, Florida.

"The Detroit Institute of Arts","Michigan","The Detroit Institute of Arts - Detroit, MI - art museum and collection","The Detroit Institute of Arts, or DIA was founded in 1885 and christened a temple of art.'' It was originally called the Detroit Museum of Art, with the name being changed in 1919 when the collection was given to the City of Detroit. Over the years, a number of expansion renovations took place, including a major build that lasted from 1999 to 2007. Today, the museum is home to more than 100 galleries covering over 670,000 square feet. This is one of the largest art collections in the United States, and their overall mission, according to their website, is to help every guest find personal meaning in art.'' The DIA is known for its diversity in art. They have a number of exhibits ranging from prehistoric and ancient art to modern work. This museum was the first public collection in the United States to ever own and display a Van Gogh painting when the institute acquired the artist's Self Portrait in 1922. Many years later, in 2000, the museum put together Van Gogh: Face to Face along with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Some of these pieces can still be seen at the DIA today in celebration of this artist's work. There are a number of permanent displays at the DIA, as well as temporary displays that are changed every few months or years. The permanent collections include artwork from Africa, Oceania, the Indigenous Americans, the United States, Europe, Asia and the Islamic World. They also have specific collections that celebrate prints, drawings, and photographs. While at the DIA, visitors may also want to visit their performing arts department, the General Motors Center for Africa American Art, and The James Pearson Duffy Department of Contemporary Art. In addition, the museum's director has hand-picked a series of 12 works, called the Director's Dozen'' In order to help preserve all of the artwork owned by the DIA, the museum has its own Conservation Department, complete with a state-of-the-art facility. Art history experts and scientists work side-by-side in this department to analyze artwork for information about its age and creation, which helps teach the museum how to best store the pieces. The DIA provides a number of educational options to visitors. They have classes for youth and adults interested in creating art, school programs for child of all ages, downloadable lesson plans for teachers, monthly artist talks, and guest lecturers throughout the year. Tourists can visit the DIA on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, on Fridays from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM, and on Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The DIA is closed to the public on Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission ranges from $4 to $8, depending on age, and museum members can visit for free. In addition, the DIA had package deals available through a number of nearby hotels, including The Detroit Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton in Dearborn, The Inn of Ferry Street, and the Townsend Hotel. For more information, visitors can call 313-833-7900 to talk to a museum staff member."
"The Detroit Opera House","Michigan","The Detroit Opera House - Detroit, Michigan - century-old opera house in Detroit","Throughout its almost 100 years of existence, the Detroit Opera House has enjoyed a distinguished history. In addition to being the permanent home of the Michigan Opera Theater, it has also been host to many famous names, such as Louis Armstrong, Luciano Pavarotti and Roy Orbison. Today, it is considered to be one of the best venues in the Midwest to see world class opera and dance. The building was designed by the local architect C. Howard Crane and opened in 1922 as the Capitol Theater. The huge building could seat up to 4,250 people and was the fifth largest theater in the world at the time. Crane, who also designed Detroit's Fox Theater, intended that the building would be as stylish as any opera house in Europe, with lavish and beautiful fittings and excellent acoustics. The interior of the building is even more impressive than the exterior and many of the features are still intact today. Crane designed the building in the Italian Renaissance style and included such touches as marble staircases, brass fixtures and chandeliers. He also made dark red one of the predominant interior colors; the draperies and the curtain on the main stage were constructed from Italian damask. Throughout the 1920s and 30s the building changed its name several times; and by the 1950s was in a state of disrepair. After renovations, it re-opened in 1960 as the Grand Circus Theater, only to close again eighteen years later. Its future was assured when the Michigan Opera Theater purchased the building in 1988 and beginning in 1996 put on a program of regular events, including five dance productions and five opera productions each year. During the last few years, the Detroit Opera House has staged productions of some of the world's best known operas, including La Boheme, Porgy and Bess and The Barber of Seville. Past ballet productions have included Romeo and Juliet and Sleeping Beauty. A comprehensive program of special events has included such diverse offerings as Chinese dance, a comedy tour and a blues festival. The Opera House has also worked hard to make opera more accessible to all; a new program called Access tries to make opera and dance more enjoyable and affordable for young people. In addition to offering a wide program of events, the Opera House also offers visitors guided tours; it's a chance to go behind the scenes and learn about the building's history and ongoing restoration. The Opera House also has a comprehensive program of state wide educational visits and workshops as well as a program in which volunteers assist with the various aspects of production. The Opera House is located in the heart of downtown Detroit, overlooking Grand Circus Park in an area of the city known as the Theater District. The well known Fox Theater is a short distance away and there is a good selection of hotels and restaurants within walking distance; some area restaurants even provide free shuttle service to the Opera House."
"The Detroit Symphony Orchestra","Michigan","The Detroit Symphony Orchestra - Detroit, Michigan - fourth oldest symphony orchestra in the country","The Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) is the fourth oldest in the United States, and for most of its almost 100 years, has been one of the most respected orchestras in the country. In addition to its regular program of concerts that are listened to by an estimated 450,000 people every year, since 1926 the orchestra has also hosted a popular series of free educational concerts for children. The DSO had modest beginnings. In 1914, a small group of Detroit society women each contributed $100, hired a young church organist named Weston Gales to be the first musical director; and the Detroit Symphony was born. The orchestra's first performance was given at the Old Opera House in Detroit, although it soon became clear that a more permanent home would be needed. The orchestra enjoyed a major boost when in 1918, the well known Russian pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch accepted the post of music director - only on condition that a brand new and permanent venue be constructed. Orchestra Hall was designed by local architect C. Howard Crane, who was also responsible for designing several other Detroit theaters, and was completed in 1919 in just a few months. In 1922 it was the venue for the world's first radio broadcast of a concert symphony. During the 1930s, the DSO suffered two major misfortunes. Gabrilowitsch died in 1936, and the Great Depression resulted in serious financial problems and the orchestra having to move to various different venues. In 1989, the DSO finally returned to Orchestra Hall, following extensive renovations. Neeme Jarvi became musical director during this time period, remaining at the helm until 2005. In 2003, further renovations helped to make Orchestral Hall one of the top venues in the city and in the entire Midwest, and an education wing and a recital hall were also added. In 2007, the DSO announced that Leonard Slatkin would become the DSO's 12th music director. Slatkin is the current director. The DSO has enjoyed many successes over the years; it has released recordings on many famous labels, including Victor, Decca and RCA; and also provided the backing strings on many big Motown hits during the 1950s and 60s. The DSO also released the first CD to win the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque, with its recording of Stravinsky's The Rites of Spring. The Detroit Symphony Youth Orchestra was established as part of a training program in conjunction with the DSO, and today this is one of the most prestigious programs for children living in the Detroit area. Today, the DSO still enjoys success in its permanent home in Orchestra Hall, a grand building which is located on Woodward Avenue in Midtown Detroit and accessible by public transportation. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and is generally considered to be one of the most acoustically perfect venues anywhere in the world. Guided tours of the building and the behind the scenes production are available, and the DSO also encourages volunteers, both individual and corporate, to support their music."
"The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel","Michigan","The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel - Detroit, Michigan - underwater border crossing into Canada from Michigan","The Detroit-Windsor tunnel is one of the busiest and most important border crossings between the United States and Canada. It also has the distinction of being the only vehicular underwater border crossing between two countries anywhere in the world. An estimated 28,000 vehicles take the mile long trip under the Detroit River every day, which means around 9 million vehicles cross into Canada or the United States at this location every year. As far back as 1870, Detroit engineers were considering a tunnel or a bridge to link the cities of Detroit and Windsor. Several attempts to build a tunnel were actually made in the late 19th century; all were abandoned for various reasons, including prohibitive costs and the discovery of harmful gases. The growth of the car industry in the early 20th century made it clear that a tunnel for road traffic was necessary. Construction proper began on the tunnel in 1928, after sufficient funding was made available by a group of Detroit bankers and a New York architectural firm verified that the tunnel would be both possible and profitable. Work commenced on both the US and the Canadian ends of the tunnel simultaneously using several different methods - a major engineering feat at the time. Construction also involved the difficult task of sinking nine steel tubes into a trench in the riverbed. The tunnel cost of around 23 million dollars and was completed in 1930, a year ahead of schedule. President Hoover dedicated the tunnel on November 1st 1930, in a ceremony from Washington that rang bells in both Detroit and Windsor to officially declare the tunnel open. Two days later, on November 3rd, 1930, the first cars made their way through the tunnel. One of the most impressive features of the tunnel is its innovative system to pump fresh air in to the tunnel; in fact the air inside is cleaner than the air at street level. Tall ventilation towers at both ends of the tunnel contain huge fans and are each responsible for ventilating half of the tunnel. The system is so effective that the air in the tunnel is changed completely every 90 seconds. Apart from the volume of traffic that it handles, the tunnel's other statistics are just as impressive. During its construction, an estimated 80,000 cubic yards of concrete were used, as well as almost 12,000 tons of steel and 50 miles of electrical cables. The interior of the tunnel is illuminated by almost 600 lights and contains 250,000 wall tiles. At any one time, up to 600 laborers worked on its construction. Today, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel provides a fast and convenient link between the US and Canada. The tunnel is jointly owned by both cities and efforts are continually being made to improve the overall travel experience. In 1993, a major renovation program costing $50 million was launched; work included improvements to lighting, the road surface and the stone covering. Current improvements are concentrating on allowing customers to pay the toll electronically, thus reducing wait times at the tolls and helping to improve traffic flow."
"The Fox Theater Building","Michigan","The Fox Theater Building - Detroit, Michigan - top theatre venue in Detroit","Detroit's Fox Theater is considered one of the premier entertainment venues in the Midwest. Over the years, the theater has played host to such famous names as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison and Mariah Carey. It is also Detroit's top venue for Broadway shows and is the second largest theater in the country, after New York's Radio City Music Hall. The theater was constructed in 1928; one of several built by the film pioneer William Fox and designed by local architect C. Howard Crane. The building was designed with a beautiful and lavish interior featuring motifs from Persia, India and China, as well as a six story high grand lobby and a huge 13 foot diameter chandelier. The Asian theme is used on the building's exterior as well; the fazade is illuminated at night and can be seen from several blocks away. Much of the original decoration can still be seen today and behind the scene tours are available at the theater for groups of 15 or more. Another way to experience the grandeur of the building's interior is to be invited to one of the special events or conventions that are regularly held here. The Fox Theater can accommodate almost 4,000 guests at a time, including 500 in the huge lobby alone. Since its opening day, the Fox Theater was Detroit's major movie venue for many decades, managing to remain open into the 1970s when other local theaters were closing. In 1988 the theater was purchased by local entrepreneur Mike Ilich, who undertook a huge restoration program, costing an estimated $12 million. His efforts helped revitalize the surrounding area, which is sometimes known as Foxtown. The theater is owned by Olympia Entertainment, which itself is owned by Mike Ilitch. Olympia also owns several other of Detroit's well known entertainment venues, such as City Theater, the Masonic Temple Theater and the Joe Louis Arena. Ilitch Holdings has its headquarters in the Fox Theater office building and has been largely responsible for renovating many buildings in downtown Detroit. Since it became a venue for live productions in the 1980s, the Fox Theater has put on an ever changing program of diverse shows. In addition to featuring many of the biggest names in the entertainment world, it has also hosted the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, the cast of Sesame Street., and shown a selection of plays and movies. One of its most popular and successful ventures was the Radio City Christmas Spectacular which ran from 1997 until 2005. Apart from the quality and range of its productions, the Fox Theater has several other distinctions. By using Fox's patented movietone sound system, it was the world's first movie theater to be constructed with equipment built in to enable it to show sound movies. Today, it is one of the most profitable theaters of its size in the country; it was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 and became a National Historic Landmark in 1989."
"The Lakes Mall","Michigan","The Lakes Mall, Muskegon, MI","Built in 2001, The Lakes Mall is located in Muskegon, Michigan. It has over sixty different stores and five anchor tenants. This mall is owned and operated under CBL and Associates Properties. CBL is one of the larger real estate investment trusts in the United States, offering more than a hundred malls throughout North America. They were also the developers of the mall. The mall has over 645,000 square feet of space all in a one story building. Construction on the mall started in 1999, but it took two years for the completion based on the sheer size of the building. When the mall opened it had these anchor stores: Sears, Bed Bath and Beyond, JC Penney, and Younkers. Dick's Sporting Goods moved in three years after the mall was completed. Before the mall was built there was a small strip mall called Lakeshore Marketplace. The area was for a former outlet site and it did get redeveloped into larger stores with Toys R' Us, Barnes and Nobles, Old Navy, TJ Maxx, and Elder Brothers. There was also Muskegon Mall that opened in 1976, which was no longer a major draw for retail stores due to Grand Rapids malls. It eventually lost the two anchors it had. As a result of the lack of good malls in shoppers' opinions, The Lake Mall development quickly became a great place to shop. It had enough of the big box stores to be a huge draw for residents. While the outlet mall area still has some of the big stores and restaurants surrounding them, they are more linked with The Lakes Mall. Muskegon Mall was demolished a little while after the new mall was built. The construction helped to bring money back into the local economy, as well. The Lakes Mall is open Monday through Saturday from 10 am to 9 pm. The mall is also open on Sundays from 11 am to 6 pm. Events and sales events are held at the mall annually to entice shoppers. Some events include photos with Santa and the Easter Bunny in spring. With close to a hundred stores in the mall there are plenty of shops for all parties to enjoy. Aeropostale, Alltel, American Eagle Outfitters, Attitudes, Bargain Books, Bath and Body Works, Beautiful Eyes by Farzana, BonWorth, Buckle, Calendar Club, Centennial Wireless, and Charlotte Russe are a few of the stores. Also at the mall are Christopher and Banks, Children's Place, Claire's, CJ Banks, DEB, Di's Hallmark, Fast Jewelers, Finish Line, Foot Locker, Forever Angels, Fred Meyer Jewelers, FYE, GameStop, Gap, GNC, Global Treasures, Gold Recyclers, HeerMee Studios, and Hollister Co. In the food court are Little Easy China, Sbarro, Stir Fry 88, Brooklyn Bagels, and Mrs. Fields Cookies. Throughout the mall one can find Auntie Anne's, Chuck E. Cheese, Cosmic Candy Company, Maui Wowi, and Sweet Temptations. Compared to other malls the food court is rather small; however, there are plenty of restaurants surrounding the mall which offer shoppers more choices."

"The Majestic Theatre","Michigan","The Majestic Theatre - Detroit, Michigan - theatre, bowling ally, and tourist location in Detroit","Detroit's Majestic Theatre is one of several in the city designed during the early 20th century by the well-known and prolific local architect C. Howard Crane. The theater was opened in 1920 and could seat almost 1,700 people; at the time it was the world's largest purpose built movie theater; today it is probably best known for its varied program of live music, including rock, jazz and blues. However, the Majestic is much more than just a great place to hear live music; it also has the distinction of being home to one of the country's oldest operating bowling alleys, the Garden Bowl. The 16 bowling lanes glow in the dark and bowlers also enjoy music from an accompanying disc jockey. The bowling alley was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The building's Majestic Cafy has long been a favorite place to meet in Detroit, even for those not attending a concert in the building. The cafy offers a selection of American and Mediterranean dishes, served in a dining room featuring exposed brickwork and wooden floors, as well as a good view overlooking the busy street below. The cafy also shows a constantly changing display of paintings by local artists. The theatre's fazade was designed in an elaborate Italian style, although this was later changed to an Art Deco theme, when the street was widened. It also featured a couple of innovative features for the time: a state of the art lighting system that could be turned up and down and an air-conditioning system that kept the theater cool by using huge fans to blow air on to blocks of ice stored in the basement. Like several other Detroit theatres, the Majestic has had to change with the times in order to survive and has had several other uses over the years, depending partly on the economic situation at the time. Throughout its almost 100 years of existence, it has been a church, a photographic studio and a shop selling trophies, as well as a movie theatre specializing in third run films. The Majestic is perhaps best known for its two live music venues, the Magic Stick and the Majestic Theater. Rolling Stone magazine declared that the Magic Stick was the best venue for live music in Detroit. Several local bands have got their start performing at one of the two venues; they have also hosted better-known groups such as Jimmy Cliff, Los Lobos, and Burning Spear. In addition to its program of live music, the Majestic Theater is also available for banquets and can provide outside catering to parties of all sizes. The building, located on what is often described as Detroit's main street, Woodward Avenue in the heart of the city's Cultural District, also boasts a pizza restaurant and several bars. It has become one of the city's most popular meeting places, as well as one of the best venues for live music in the Midwest and a popular choice for private parties and other events."
"The Palace of Auburn Hills","Michigan","The Palace of Auburn Hills, Auburn Hills, Michigan","Detroit, Michigan is home to a number of different venues that a vacationer may be interested in. Just outside the Detroit area is Auburn Hills, Michigan, which is home to the Palace of Auburn Hills Arena. The building is a sports and entertainment venue for local residents and visitors. The arena was opened in 1988 as a home for the Detroit Pistons, an NBA team. The arena has also hosted the Detroit Shock of the WNBA. It used to be the home for the Detroit Vipers, an IHL team. However, the team ended in 2001. It was home to Detroit Safari of the CISL and the Detroit Fury of the AFL, also. The Detroit Piston's never had a real home, until the 1988 building of the Palace. Before that they were in Olympia Stadium and Cobo Arena, which were both undersized for the NBA team. Bill Davidson, the owner of the Joe Louis Arena for the Detroit Red Wings refused to share his space with the team. For a time the team was at the Pontiac Silverdome, but it did not offer great sight lines for basketball viewing. Eventually the team was able to get $70 million in private funding for the Palace of Auburn Hills. It is more than a home for the basketball team, though. Each year there are concerts held at the Palace. The first concert at the arena was Sting in 1988. David Lee Roth, Pink Floyd, and Crosby, Stills and Nash followed suit. The Palace is rich with history as it was the site of an assassination attempt on Jimmy Page, the Led Zeppelin guitarist in 1995. The Cure recorded a live album at the arena in 1992 and Kiss also recorded their third live album in 1992 at the arena. Phish was at the arena in 1997, as well as 1995, 1996, and 1999. The Palace of Auburn Hills hosted WCW World War 3 for pay per view in 1997 and 1998. The WWF's SummerSlam was also at the arena. Madonna broadcasted live for her HBO Drowned World Tour and TNA's Slammiversary was held at the arena in 2009. For many years artists and sporting events have been held at the arena. In previous years and coming soon will be acts like Van Halen, Rod Stewert, and Aerosmith. The arena tries to keep popular concerts and events at the palace. The capacity for the arena is 22,000 people and up to 23,000 for concerts. There are luxury suites on site, 180 in all. Most of them are leased throughout the year despite the large number. Concessions located at the Palace include such items as fresh baked cookies, chicken sandwiches, chicken strips, pizza, Philly steaks, roasted almonds, and BBQ chicken sandwiches. Bratwurst, kettle corn, fresh popped popcorn, hot dogs, and Italian sausage are also available for food items.

"TimberStone Golf Club, Pine Mountain Resort, Iron Mountain, Michigan An Upscale, 5-Star Golf Course and Resort in Michigan's Upper Peninsula","Michigan","TimberStone Golf Club, Pine Mountain Resort, Iron Mountain, Michigan An Upscale, 5-Star Golf Course and Resort in Michigan's Upper Peninsula","TimberStone Golf Course is part of the Pine Mountain Golf & Ski Resort in Iron Mountain in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The course is set amid the towering pine trees and hardwood forests atop rolling mountain terrain, making for some spectacular scenery and some of the hallmarks of Northern Michigan golf. The 18-hole, par-72 public course was designed by Jerry Matthews and opened in 1997. TimberStone features plush, Bent grass fairways as it plays through majestic oak trees, red and white pine trees, and some of the largest stones found on a golf course. Water hazards come into play on six of the 18 holes, and there are numerous sand traps along the way as the course steadily climbs the underlying mountainside. The course plays to 6,937 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.2 and a slope rating of 148. From the middle (White) tees, the course only plays to a modest 5,832 yards. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 6, a par-4 that plays to 413 yards from the back tees, but only 349 from the Timber'' (White) tees. The challenge comes from the large water hazard that cuts in front of the tee boxes, then tracks the hole along the left side all the way to the green. The putting surface is sizable, but long and narrow, which may help golfers on the approach shot as they'll be playing over the water hazard once again. Hole No. 8 is a par-3 that plays to 211 yards from the Forest'' (Championship) tees, and 157 yards from the Whites. The hole plays downhill to a green surrounded by water at the back, so club selection is the key challenge on this tee shot. Hole No. 9 is the longest par-4 on the course, and the #3 handicap. The hole plays to 471 yards from the back tees and 448 from the Blues. This tree-lined hole features a fairly tight fairway as it jogs downhill and then doglegs left, where water hazards right and left come into play on the approach to the green. Hole No. 12 is a picturesque and challenging par-4 that plays to only 345 yards from the back tees and 325 yards from the Blues. The tee shot calls for a carry over water to a snaking landing area, followed by an approach shot to a green guarded by bunkers. Hole No. 17 is the signature hole on the course, a par-3 that plays severely downhill. From the tee box, golfers have a stunning view of two states and three counties, as well as Bass Lake. From the back tees, the hole plays to 215 yards, but the 110-foot drop in elevation to a green tight to a row of trees on the right will make club selection the biggest challenge regardless of tee choice. Since its opening, TimberStone has received a good deal of acclaim. In 1998, Golf Digest ranked it #3 among the Best New Upscale Public Courses, then gave it a 41/2-Star Rating in 2001. Subscribers of the magazine rated the course even more highly, giving it a prestigious 5-Star rating, making it one of only 16 courses out of the 3,500 rated to receive the award. Practice facilities at the course include a multi-target driving range and practice putting green. There's also a full-service pro shop and lessons are available.

The bay has two arms, and the park is located at the south end of the bay where the Boardman River empties into its western arm. In its totality, the bay is 32 miles long, 10 miles wide and as deep as 600 feet in certain areas, and its name is derived from the 18th-century French sailors who named it la grand traverse'' for the long crossing'' they had to make at the bay's mouth. The park's 343 sites are nestled among a completely wooded setting of hardwood (fruit and nut-bearing) and softwood (conifers, such as pine, fir and spruce) trees. Some of the most popular warm-weather activities for visitors include picnicking on the grass, the beach, or at tables and grills available to day-use visitors. The park also adjoins the TART (Traverse Area Recreational Trail), which is of particular interest to bikers and hikers in the warm months, and cross-country skiers in the winter. The TART is a 10.5-mile trail that runs from the west side of Traverse City to Acme, Michigan and, for the most part, follows the roadbed of the old Chicago and West Michigan Railway. The trail is intersected by a number of other non-motorized trails throughout the Travers City area, including the Boardman Lake Trail, the Leelenau Trail and the Vasa Pathway found in the Pere Marquette State Forest east of Traverse City. Swimming, sunbathing, power boating and sailing are also prime park activities during the summer, and there's even a playground for children. Fishing charters can also be found in Grand Traverse Bay for anglers looking to hook some trout, salmon or panfish. There's also an element of Michigan's early history to the park, which was established in 1920 after the logging industry had begun its decline. The Ottawa branch of the Algonquin Indians were the area's original inhabitants, and there are still about 15,000 Ottawa living in the state."
"Treetops Resort, Masterpiece Course, Gaylord, Michigan - a Robert Trent Jones, Sr. Design at One of the Best Golf Resorts in the Nation","Michigan","Treetops Resort, Masterpiece Course, Gaylord, Michigan - a Robert Trent Jones, Sr. Design at One of the Best Golf Resorts in the Nation","Treetops Resort in Gaylord, Michigan is the home of five different golf courses, all designed by renowned golf-course architects. The Masterpiece Course was the first of the five to open in 1987, and is the design of Robert Trent Jones, Sr. The Masterpiece Course is said to derive its name from the moment when Jones was first surveying the property. As he and owner Harry Melling stood atop the hill that would become the 6th tee, overlooking the Pigeon River Valley, Jones envisioned his Masterpiece.'' As the story goes, Jones also suggested the name Treetops'' for what was at that time the Sylvan Knob Ski Area. The Masterpiece Course features a number of the hallmarks associated with golf in Northern Michigan, including rolling terrain, lots of trees and some beautiful scenery, including views of up to 30 miles. The course also is known for its large greens (averaging more than 6,000 square feet), challenging pin placements and elevation changes. There's also no shortage of hazards, from water to sand to deep ravines, and the greens are known for not offering much room for error on approach shots. The 18-hole, par-72 championship course plays to 7,060 yards from the Black tees, with a USGA rating of 75.5 and a slope rating of 144, making it one of the tougher courses in the state and true to designer Jones' motto, Hard par, easy bogey.'' The Masterpiece plays to a much more manageable 6,399 yards from the Blues and 5,817 from the Whites, and it's not uncommon for the staff to recommend golfers play one tee shorter than normal on this course. The more noteworthy holes on this course are many, including the opening hole, which is considered one of the best opening holes in the state. The par-5 hole plays to 524 yards, but a good drive will find the downhill side of the fairway. A pond guards the front of a wide, narrow green, giving golfers pause if they're thinking of getting on in two. It's been said that course designer Jones was the first golf architect to envision the concept of a signature'' hole, and the signature hole at the Masterpiece is No. 6, where the course and resort name were born. The tee box for the par-3 hole sits 120 feet higher than the putting surface, and golfers will find themselves looking down at the treetops as they take aim at the green. Holes 7, 8, and 9 all incorporate the headwaters of the Pigeon River, and comprise some of the most scenic on the course. Hole No. 8 is a long par-4 that plays downhill through a funnel of trees to a 44-yard-long peninsular green surrounded by water. And, just to change things up, Hole No. 9 features an island tee box. The accolades and honors the course has received include 4.5 Stars among Places to Play'' in 2008 and a ranking at #56 among America's Top 75 Golf Resorts'' in 2006. The course is also home of one of the finest instructional programs in the nation, the Rick Smith Golf Academy. The Masterpiece course has its own clubhouse and pro shop, and the resort also features two restaurants, as well as a Conference Center."
"Tullymore Golf Club","Michigan","Tullymore Golf Club, Standwood, Michigan - One of the Most Unique Resort Golf Courses in Michigan","Tullymore Golf Course is one of two courses found at the Resorts of Tullymore and St. Ives in Standwood, Michigan. Collectively, they have been called the highest-rated pair of golf courses of any Michigan resort. Tullymore was designed by Jim Engh and Jerry Matthews and features a unique layout that incorporates elements of European courses and traditional American designs. One of the most noteworthy elements of the course is some dramatic bunkering that is unlike anything most golfers have encountered. Soft, white sand is often surrounded by intricate, contoured mounding and the bunkers weave throughout the fairways as well as the green complexes. Such hazard are sure to affect shot and club selection, and may create more of a challenge than the many pines and hardwood trees that line the fairways. There are also some daunting water hazards, including Shinglebolt Creek, found on the course, as well as some subtle ups and downs as the tranquill course winds through 800 acres of woodlands. The course has been described by Golf Digest critic Ron Whitten as having an art deco flavor with its greens and fairways that follow precise and parallel zigzags, its artictically shaped bunkers and it symmetrically repetitive mounding. That architectural artistry is only part of what will fascinate you during your round.'' Whitten also had this to say: Tullymore is a bedazzling golf course, a unique style of golf design that's imposed upon the landscape without being an imposition.'' The course plays to 7,148 yards from the Silver tees, with one of the highest slope ratings in the Midwest at 148. From the Whites, the course only plays to 5,550 yards, so most golfers will choose something in between and play either the Black or Blue tees. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 2, rated the most difficult on the course. This par-4 hole plays fairly straight, but is a bit lengthy at 456 yards from the back tees, but only 397 from the Blues. What makes this hole so challenging is the water that runs up the left side for most of the hole, the undulating fairway, and the signature bunker that looms upon the right about 130 yards from the green. Hole No. 7 is par-3 that plays to only 148 yards from the Blue tees, but it's said to have one of the testiest greens on the course. The putting surface is 47 yards deep, and also features some dramatic undulations, which makes bogey on this hole a very frequent occurrence. Another great hole is the par-3 12th, which golf writers have said resembles the famous Dell Hole at Lahinch Golf Club in Ireland. The holes plays to 257 yards from the back tees, but only 157 yards from the Blues. What makes it so daunting, however, is the carry over water to a green tucked behind some mounding that can obscure the target. The finishing hole is a par-5 that plays to 478 yards from the Blue tees, and is also one of the most photogenic to be found. The hole wraps around a lake, and has been called by Golf Chicago as one of the greatest finishing holes in Michigan.'' Practice facilities at Tullymore include a generous driving range, and a short-game area for pitching and putting. Free range balls are included with every round of golf. The course offer features a new clubhouse with a Pro Shop, as well as several options for dining, including the Tap Room at Tullymore and Devine's Fine Dining,"
"Twelve Oaks Mall","Michigan","Twelve Oaks Mall, Novi, MI","Twelve Oaks Mall is one of the upscale super malls in Michigan. This mall is located in Novi, a suburb of Detroit. It was built by Taubman Centers in 1977, as part of a three mall development. The other two malls are Fairlane Town Center and Lakeside Mall, which opened a year earlier. The mall offers 200 stores with 5 anchors. Retail space is 1.5 million square feet total with 122,000 to 300,000 square feet per anchor. The mall offers over 7,000 parking spaces. The square footage of the mall includes two floors for all but Macy's, which has 3 malls. At the time the mall opened Lord and Taylor, Hudson's, JC Penney, and Sears were the anchors. The mall actually sets on a site of an old gravel pit. The development plans began in 1971, and construction began in 1975. The mall was partly built to stop landfill from being placed in the old gravel pit. Over the years changes occurred to the mall through renovations. The closed United Artists theater was demolished to make room for the Lifestyle Cafe food court. It also allowed floor kiosks to be added in 2002. In 2005 a $63 million expansion occurred offering more store space. Nordstrom was able to move into the mall as an anchor at this point. Macy's, Hudson's originally, also got an upgrade. The architecture of Twelve Oaks Mall is unlike the other malls. Its interior offers wood railings with steel bars, terrazzo flooring, and sculptures. There are also a number of modern art pieces and trees. The renovations to the mall included adding an elevator, seating areas, new flooring, and much more. The interior has a lot of silver and mirrored accents as a result of the renovation. Mall hours of operation are Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm, Sunday 12pm to 6pm. Events are held at the mall including photos with Santa. During the year one can expect to see sales events at a number of different stores. Ticketmaster also has a box office at the mall for anyone wishing to see a concert in the Detroit area. Armani Exchange, Abercrombie, Aerie, Aeropostale, Aldo, American Eagle Outfitters, Ann Taylor Loft, Artisans Jewelers, Aveda, Bachrach, Bakers, Banana Republic, Bare Essentuals, Bath and Body Works, Bebe, Belli Culture, and Bestsey Johnson are a few of the 200 stores inside Twelve Oaks. Borders Express, Brighton Collectibles, Brookstone, Build a Bear, Cache, Carnival Cuts, Champ Sports, Charlotte Russe, Chico's, Delia's, Fine Touch Tailoring, Finish Line, For Love 21, Forever 21, Fossil, FYE, GameStop, Hollister, Intrinsic Collections, J Crew, and Janie and Jack are a few of the other locations. The mall is not without a decent selection of food including A&W, Auntie Anne's, California Pizza Kitchen, Dale and Thomas Popcorn, Great Steak and Potato, Haagen Dazs, Just Baked, Kerby's Koney Island, and Lakeshore Grill. Also for restaurants one has Mrs. Fields, Nestle Toll House, Nordstrom Cafe Bistro, Olga's Kitchen, Pretzel Time, Quizno's, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Sanders, Sbarro's, and Starbucks."
"Universal Mall","Michigan","Universal Mall, Warren, MI","Detroit, Michigan has a number of suburbs, and therefore a requirement for numerous malls. Universal Mall is in the suburb Warren. It was a fairly old enclosed mall, having been built in 1965. Universal Mall as it was in 1965 is no longer at the Warren location. The mall was closed in June 2008 as it lost shoppers and retail stores. However, there will be a new Universal Mall shopping center on the same site. Construction began in July 2009 to bring an outdoor shopping center into the mix. At the time the old mall was built the anchor stores were Montgomery Ward and Federal. Federal became Crowley's. The mall was expanded in the 80's to offer a food court, movie theater, and Mervyn's. Montgomery Ward closed in 2000. Mervyn's left in 2006 along with Value City in 2008. Burlington Coat Factory moved into one of the empty anchor store locations as did AJ Wright. At the time the mall closed there were 5 anchor tenant spaces with over 765,000 square feet of retail space on one floor. By the 1990's Universal Mall was considered a dead mall having lost most of their tenants. The demolition is making way for a $20 million complex that will have Target as one of the anchors. In fact Target opened in July 2009. It is thought about 35 businesses will be a part of the mall. The only stores to survive the dead mall and demolition were AJ Wright, Burlington Coat Factory, and the movie theater. Del Taco and Petco are also slated to be at the new mall complex. The new mall hours will be Monday through Saturday 10am to 9pm, and Sunday 12am to 5pm. Since the new mall is to be an outdoor style complex there will only be sales events held during the year. A lot of these outdoor complexes are being built throughout the United States. They tend to have blocks of stores set up in a huge area of land. For example an anchor tenant like Target could stand alone or be a part of a larger block of stores; however, Target would be the center of that block. Typically the anchor is either in the middle or on one end, with things like Brookstone and other smaller retail stores surrounding it. Some of the stores that might be included in the mall will include All the Kings Men, Auto Photo Systems, Bamboo Gardens, Brain Games, Bo Rics, Chase Bank, Clothes Den, Chic Hair Fashions, City Hatter Men's Store, and others. Blockbuster Video is also slated to be within the complex. The restaurants surrounding the new mall have yet to be released. However, one can assume there will be a mixture of fast food and sit down restaurants. These complexes generally bring in places like TGI Friday's or Chili's, as well as McDonald's and other popular chains. A few of the stores will be Michigan specific, but one can also expect to find some of the top brand companies at this new mall location in the coming months."
"Van Andel Arena","Michigan","Van Andel Arena, Grand Rapids, MI","Grand Rapids, Michigan is a fairly large city, though nowhere near the scale of Detroit. As such a large place it has been necessary to build a multipurpose arena to house the many concerts and sporting events that come to the area. The Van Andel Arena was finished in 1996 after $75 million was put into the construction and materials. The arena is the official home for the Grand Rapids Griffins Ice Hockey Team. It also is the home for Grand Rapids Hoops basketball team and the Grand Rapids Rampage AFL team. For ice hockey the center can host 10,800 people and concerts can handle 13,100 people. The concert type will vary the seating arrangements. Endstage concerts can only handle 12,800 people, whereas center stage can take on more. When the facility was created they made room for 16 luxury suites. The upper bowl seating area handles 20 each with 24 in the lower bowl area. 1298 retractable seats are offered at the Van Andel Arena. Events like Disney on Ice, NCAA Hockey Regional Championships, the AFL ArenaBowl XV, and Detroit Pistons against the Michigan State University Basketball games have been at the arena.

Parking is located at the arena with handicapped accessible spots, as well as plenty of parking for larger vehicles. The parking area opens a few hours before the event to make sure everyone can get in the center on time. Tickets are not accepted until an hour before the event to make sure the arena is safe and enough time for people is left to reach their seats. Safety considerations also means no large backpacks or purses are allowed into the arena. No outside food or drinks are allowed either. Van Andel Arena supplies concession stands and portable carts for food. Depending on the event various concession options can be offered. For concerts sometimes there are less concessions like popcorn, soda, water, and alcohol. For sporting events visitors can expect hot dogs, popcorn, pretzels, hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, fries, peanuts, and much more will be provided. Beverages at games include beer, wine, a variety of sodas, bottled water, snow cones, and lemonade.

"Westland Center","Michigan","Westland Center, Westland, MI","Westland is a section of Detroit, Michigan. The Westland Mall is part of the four land'' malls in the Detroit area. The others are Southland, Northland, and Eastland. All of the land malls have over 100 stores of upscale origins. This particular mall was built in 1965 by Hudson before being turned over to Jones Lang LaSalle for management and ownership a few years back. The mall has four anchor tenants in 1.056,000 square feet. The anchor stores are 89,000 to 354,000 square feet each. The mall has one main floor with a small basement and mezzanine. The only exception is Macy's, which has 4 floors and a basement. The Hudson Corporation began the mall as an enclosed center with climate control. It was the first fully enclosed mall in Michigan. The building of the mall helped create a new city in 1966. Livonia was trying to annex Nankin Township. When the mall was built the people decided to change Nankin into a city, calling it Westland. This stopped Livonia from overtaking the township, and making it the fourth largest city in the county. Besides Hudson as the anchor, there was also Kresge and Kroger. These two stores closed, allowing JC Penney to move in during 1976. MainStreet also joined the mall in the 80's before leaving and allowing Khol's to come to the mall in 1988. Hudson became Marshall Field's in 2001, when Hudson became Target. This eventually turned into Macy's in 2006. Center hours at Westland are Sunday 11am to 6pm and Monday to Saturday 10am to 9pm. The mall offers sales events during the year at various stores. There can be mall wide sales events or store specific. Other events include photos with Santa during the holiday season. At this time the mall will also change their owners for the Christmas shopper. Westland Mall offers Aeropostale, Alvmni, American Eagle Outfitters, Art Glass Pendant, Bath and Body Works, Benson Diamond Jewelers, Body Arts, BonBons, Borders Express, Brilliant Diamonds, Champs Sports, Charlotte Russe, The Children's Place, Christopher and Banks, CJ Banks, Claire's Boutique, Dance Academy, and Empire Today as some of its stores. Also at the mall are Exotic Images, Express, Far East Trading, Fischer's Hallmark, Foot Locker, Forever 21, FYE, and Game Stop.

As with any mall there are food locations inside and out. A few of the places to eat are Coffee Beanery, Mrs. Fields Cookies, Pretzel Peddler, Pretzel Place, Subway, Lakeshore Grill, Longhorn Steakhouse, Olga's Kitchen, and Panera Bread. Westland Mall is a lot like the other four land malls in the stores being offered. Most of the shoppers at Westland Mall are locals, though they do get a few tourists at the mall that come to Detroit for business or holidays."
"Windmill Island, Holland, Michigan, a Municipal Park and a Beautiful Oasis of Dutch Culture","Michigan","Windmill Island, Holland, Michigan, a Municipal Park and a Beautiful Oasis of Dutch Culture","Windmill Island is an oasis of beauty located within the city of Holland, Michigan. It's a 36-acre municipal park filled with well-tended gardens, canals, dikes, and a 240-year-old, authentic Dutch windmill that produces stone-ground flour. The De Zwaan,'' as the windmill is called, means graceful bird'' - an apt name as the windmill towers over the island park and its stunning palette of colorful flowers and sights. It is the only authentic Dutch windmill in operation in the United States. The island also features an antique, hand-painted Dutch carousel that's more than 100 years old. The antique carousel is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship that was imported from East Groningren, the Netherlands in 1971. The carousel features hand-made animal figures and a barrel organ that plays music produced from paper music albums, which can play for two hours without repeating. The carousel stands more than 15 feet tall and is more than 25 feet wide, making it one of the island's most noteworthy attractions. The island is particularly beautiful in the spring, when more than 150,000 tulips are in bloom, coinciding with the Holland area's renowned Tulip Time Festival in early May. The festival draws more than half a million visitors and was named by Reader's Digest in 2004 as the Best Small Town Festival in America.'' In the summer months, flowers and annuals continue to cover the island in a sea of colorful and fragrant blooms. Other attractions on the island include the Posthouse Museum, which is an exact replica of a 14th-century wayside inn. Inside, visitors are entertained by a 12-minute presentation about Windmills, including the island's own De Zwaan, and The Netherlands. There is also a miniature Netherlands Village on display, and the sights and sounds of costumed dancers performing in old-time klompen (wooden shoes). A number of souvenir shops offer mementos of a visit to the island, and treats such as the area's world-famous fudge abound. There are also costumed guides and tours, as well as a number of additional Dutch displays and shops. Around the island lies the city of Holland, Michigan, which is a blend of traditional Dutch architecture, ambiance, and some of the most solemn aspects of the culture, combined with modern diversity and charm. In addition to the Dutch culture and attractions, the area boasts an array of recreational activities, beautiful beaches, galleries and unique shops, visual and performing arts, and exceptional dinining. The city of Holland has also been honored with a number of awards, including being named one of the country's Dozen Distinctive Destinations'' by the National Trust for Historic Preservation; One of the Top Five Places to Retire,'' by Money Magazine; and an All America City'' by the National Civic League. Downtown Holland even has a unique snowmelt system'' that keeps its streets and walkways clear and dry in winter. Together, Windmill Island and Holland make for a destination that is rich in Dutch culture and history, as well as small-town charm in a beautiful setting along the shores of Lake Michigan."
"Woodland Mall","Michigan","Woodland Mall, Grand Rapids, MI","Woodland Mall is one of the two malls in Grand Rapids, Michigan and the more popular option. This mall was opened in 1968, one year after Centerpointe Mall. However, Woodland Mall being just across the street is much larger, yet designed by Taubman Centers like Centerpointe. Management and ownership of the mall is currently Pennsylvania Real Estate. Woodland Mall has 100 stores, with four anchors. Total space is 1,100,000 square feet on one floor. The current anchors are JC Penney, Sears, Macy's, and Barnes and Noble. There is also a movie theater on the premises. Sears and JC Penney have been at the mall since it opened in 1968. During its original construction Kresge Dime Store was also at the mall. Hudson's moved in during an expansion in 1975. Kresge closed in 1987. Hudson's in 1997 sued the mall when they were going to allow a fourth anchor store- Lord and Taylor. They won the case and the store was never built. In 2001 Hudson's became Marshall Field's, which lead to Macy's in 2006. During the late 90's renovations were made to the mall to include a food court and play area. Eventually in the early 2000's a 14 screen theater owned by Cinemark was created with Red Robin and On the Border restaurant located nearby. It was not until 2008 that Barnes and Noble built a location near the mall. Though it is considered an anchor store the two story bookstore is an out parcel. In 2007 Interurban Transit Partnership created six bus routes to the mall. Shopping hours for visiting the mall are usually Monday through Saturday 9am to 9pm, Sunday 12pm to 6pm. Holiday hours will change the mall hours such as being closed on Christmas day, with the mall open 8am to 9pm the day after. Stores at Woodland Mall include Claire's, Dakota Watch Company, Icing, Lids, Piercing Pagoda, York Country Designs, Bath and Body Works, Body Shop, Trade Secret, and European Spa.

Other clothing options include Campus Den, Wet Seal, President Tuxedo, Ann Taylor, Cache, Charlotte Russe, Chico's, Coldwater Creek, Forever 211, J Jill, Motherhood Maternity, New York and Co., Limited and Vanity. Sleeping Tiger, Select Comfort, and York Country Designs are a few of the specialty stores. Shoppers needing a little rest can spend time in the food court and restaurants. These places include Auntie Anne's, A&W, Bar Louie, Barnes and Noble Cafe, EuroPan, Great Steak and Potato Company, Lotus Express, Nestle Toll House Cafe, Olga's Kitchen, Red Robin, On the Border, Sbarro's, Sensational Salads, Starbucks, Subway, Suki Hana, Surf City, and Wetzel's Pretzels. Like Barnes and Noble some of the sit down style restaurants are actually out parcel, meaning they are in the area of the mall, such as in the outer regions of the parking area. They are convenient, but allow for shoppers to eat outside of the mall."
"World's Largest Stove","Michigan","World's Largest Stove - Detroit, Michigan - tourist attraction featuring a large novelty stove","Standing 25 feet high and weighing around 15 tons, the world's largest stove is located in Detroit Michigan. This stove measures approximately 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. It was originally created for the Michigan Stove Co.'s 1893 Columbian Exposition, and it was restored and moved multiple times, most recently for the Michigan State Fair in 1998. This stove is designed as a large-scale replica for an old coal or wood burning stove, modeled after the company's Garland kitchen range model. The stove was designed by William J. Keep and is actually carved from oak, but painted with black and silver paint to look like metal. The sculptor is unknown, but most speculate that it was created by either John Tabaczuk or Joachim Jungwirth. It is located within the Michigan State Fairgrounds, and is most popularly viewed during fairground events, so viewing hours and admission costs depend on the event being held. Visitors can also call the fairgrounds in advance to access the area in the off-season. Originally, it stood on a 20-foot-tall platform above a large display of stoves, and today, it stands on a smaller platform and has a plaque talking about the Michigan Stove Company and the history of this large tourist attraction."
