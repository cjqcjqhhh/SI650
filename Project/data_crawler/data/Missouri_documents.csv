"18th and Vine District in Kansas City - Kansas City MO Jazz Negro League Baseball Museums","Missouri","18th and Vine District in Kansas City - Kansas City MO Jazz Negro League Baseball Museums","The sharp bleat of a trumpet and the smooth crooning of a saxophone let you know that you have arrived at the 18th and Vine District in Kansas City. Located just east of the current downtown area, this historical downtown hub is considered to be one of the cradles of jazz. Former residents include many well known musicians, the most famous of whom remains Charlie Parker. Known for short riffs and jam sessions in its crowded clubs, the 1920's and 1930's were the heydays for jazz in the area. A multi-million dollar restoration of the area began in the 1980's and has culminated in the recent opening of several museums celebrating the history of the area. Visitors will find the restaurants, clubs, and exhibits in the 18th and Vine District informative and distinctive. Some of the new museums which have opened in the area include the Kansas City Jazz museum, the Negro League Baseball museum, and the American Jazz museum. Any one of these museums is worth a trip out to the district. The Negro League Baseball museum is especially noteworthy because it recreates the look, sound, and feel of the early games. Many visitors are not aware that there was a separate league until the 1960's as most consider the 1947 signing of Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers to be the end of the color barrier. Coming down to the 18th and Vine District in Kansas City would also not be complete without a visit to the Gem Theater Cultural and Performing Arts Center. A 500 seat theater, the location has been restored with historical accuracy but modern sightline techniques to ensure that there is not a bad seat in the house. Local and national performing acts are showcased, with an emphasis on dance and multi-media events. A rotating cultural exhibit is housed on the second floor."

"Anheuser Busch in St. Louis, Missouri","Missouri","Anheuser Busch in St. Louis, Missouri","The Anheuser Busch Company in St. Louis, Missouri first opened in 1852, after Eberhard Anheuser purchased the financially ailing Bavarian Brewery; he named the company E. Anheuser and Company. Though he had no experience in the brewery business, his son-in-law Adolphus Busch was a business entrepreneur in his own right. Busch was a successful German-born businessman, who joined his father-in-law in business in 1860, and together they formed Anheuser Busch Company, which became a leading local brewery business. During the 1870's, Busch became the first brewer in America to use pasteurization, which allowed the brewed beer to be transported over a long distance. Busch also introduced artificial refrigeration, refrigerated railcars and ice-houses by the rail side. All of these technologies combined together to allow beer to be shipped all over America without spoiling. The grounds contain three buildings that have been designated historical landmarks; the Old School House, the Brew House and the Clydesdale Stables. The Old School House was where the children of August Busch were educated and once the building was no longer needed for school, Busch purchased the building and converted it into offices for the company. The Brew House has been expanded over the years and as of 2007, it has an average capacity to produce 15.8 million barrels, today the building serves as the heart of the brewery. The Clydesdale Stables were originally designed to be the private stables of August A. Busch, and is now home to the world famous Budweiser Clydesdale horses. Anheuser Busch continues to enjoy its top spot as the largest brewery in the United States. The brewery was designated a historical landmark in 1966 and contains some 189 separate structures spread out over an area of 142 acres, many of them done in the Romanesque red-brick style. In 2008, Anheuser Busch was named the number one most admired company in the United States and in the world.

Despite the harsh weather that plagues fans in the winter months of the season, the stadium has sold out for more than 17 consecutive seasons. Ice storms and freezing rain have delayed games, but it is not the weather that has earned the stadium Sport's Illustrated's title of Toughest Place to Play''. Once measured at an ear splitting 116 decibels, the maniacally loyal Chiefs fans cheer on their team at top volume. The result is that the Chiefs have the best at-home record of any team in the NFL. The stadium has its own band, the TD Pack Band, led by the DiPardo family, who provides live music in addition to the fan volume. For their contributions to the overall atmosphere and several customized team songs (ie, The Chiefs are on the Warpath''), Tony DiPardo was awarded a Superbowl ring along with the regular team members after the Chiefs victory at SuperBowl IV. Renovations in 2007 and 2008 are providing upgrades to the stadium. These renovations include luxury suites, a Chiefs Halls Of Honor and upgraded visual media equipment.

With the renovations, the Chiefs have pledged to remain at Arrowhead through 2031. Comforted, fans will continue modifying the national anthem that is sung at the stadium. Loudly and proudly, they declare Arrowhead to be the  . . .land of the free, and the home of the CHIEFS''."

"Branson Creek Golf Course","Missouri","Branson Creek Golf Course, Hollister, Missouri - A Tom Fazio Championship Golf Course Set in the Southern Missouri Ozarks","According to many golf publications, the Branson Creek Golf Course isn't just the class of the Branson area, it's the class of Missouri. The course is the design of renowned golf course architect Tom Fazio, and plays through the hills and high plateaus of southern Missouri's Ozark Mountains. The 18-hole, par-71 championship layout plays to 7,036 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 73.0 and a slope rating of 133 on Zoysia grass fairways. The course has been described as postcard ready,'' which is a tribute to the natural beauty of the area and the views, as the course plays along high, rocky ridges, hills covered by purple flowers, and down into plunging valleys. The course, which opened in 2000, also features the other elements expected of a mountain course, with lakes, ponds, mountain streams, rugged rock outcroppings, along with pine, cedar and dogwood trees. It's been said of the course that one beautiful hole flows to the next, and there's also a bit of a links-style'' feel to the course as well, as bunkering and mounding come into play on a number of holes. Some of the more noteworthy holes include Hole No. 2, which is the #1-handicap on the course. This par-4 plays to a lengthy 471 yards from the back tees, playing downhill into a tight landing area. Approach shots then take aim at a green guarded by high mounds and rocks on the right and a bunkered slope for any shots to the left. Another challenging hole is No. 5, which sports the name Heller High Water.'' This par-4 plays downhill to a lengthy 449 yards from the back tees, but only 369 from the Silver tees. This scenic hole provides a stunning view of the spacious fairway and the valley, as well as the green which is guarded by a lake. Hole No. 7 has been called one of the most demanding par-3s in the country.'' The hole plays downhill, but that only slightly offsets its length - 245 yards from the back tees and a respectable 195 from the forward men's tees. A large bunker guards the front-right of the green, with a lake at the rear. There aren't many golf courses where caves are visible, but Hole No. 17 is one of them. This short par-3 plays downhill to a green set against the backdrop of a rock ledge, where a cave was exposed during construction of the hole. The finishing hole is a replica of Pebble Beach's No. 18, making for a memorable end to the round. This par-5 is a dogleg left guarded by numerous bunkers and a sea of trees'' on the left for any golfer who tries to shortcut too much of the fairway. Since its opening, Branson Creek has drawn rave reviews. Golf Digest ranked it the Top Public Course in Missouri in 2001-2002, and also named the course one of the Top 10 New Upscale Public Courses in 2000.

Located in the Central West End, the church was built in the early 20th century and was a replacement for the Church of St. Louis IX, King of France located on the riverfront since 1770. The cathedral was designated as a basilica on April 4th, 1979, by the late Pope John Paul the II. During 1912, the installation of mosaics began on the interior. The project was finally completed in 1988, and now contains some 41.5 million pieces of glass tesserae pieces using over 7,000 different colors. The mosaic covers over 83,000 square feet, and were created by over 20 different artists and is one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. In the basement of the church, there is a museum and artifacts that have been found within the cathedral over the centuries. Also located in the lower level, is a mortuary chapel which contains the remains of former leaders of the archdioceses. The remains of Cardinals John J. Glennon, John Carberry and Joseph Ritter are interred in the crypts. Outside of the Cathedral stands the Angel of Harmony. The statue stands 14 feet high and is made of welded stainless steel, by native St. Louis artist Wiktor Szostalo. The statue was installed on the grounds of the Cathedral in 1999, and is located in between the rectory and the church. It is of an African-American angel that stands behind three children of Hispanic, Asian and European descent. The wings of the statue are made of wind chimes and are designed to represent peace, harmony and racial justice. The organ inside the church is another unique feature of the basilica.

"Celebration City Theme Park","Missouri","Celebration City Theme Park - Branson MO - Amusement Park Rides Route 66","Billed as a night-time theme park, the Celebration City theme park in Branson was a raging success right up until the end. Together with its sister park, Silver Dollar City, the park celebrated American life and various elements of the geography of the United States. Attractions included a miniature Route 66, a boardwalk from the 1920's, and a small town America from the 1900's. The theme park opened in 2003 on the site of a former park known as Mutton Hollow. It had been purchased by the Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation and completely redesigned and redecorated. The park featured several rides, including a log flume opened in 2008, as well as a water, fire and laser show that ran nightly. The typical season for the park was May to October. Unfortunately, like many other parts of the country, Branson has felt the effects of the economic downturn. Lower visitor levels had left many attractions with unmet financial obligations. Celebration City found itself struggling to pay the bills as the 2008 tourist season progressed. After much deliberation and speculation in the local press, the Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation made an announcement. The park would finish the 2008 season but would not be reopening for the 2009 season. The recent upgrades and additions such as the log flume ride had put the park into an unprofitable position. It is not known what will happen to the Celebration City theme park location. With the recently refurbished attractions still in good working order, it could make an attractive item on the auction block. The Herschend Family may also decide to simply let the park sit out a year while the market recovers and tourist traffic goes back up to former levels. Either way, the night-time entertainment of the park will be sorely missed in Branson."
"Central West End Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Neighborhood As sociation Entertainment","Missouri","Central West End Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Neighborhood As sociation Entertainment","The Central West End Neighborhood in Saint Louis claims to be the very heart of the city. With its beautiful basilica and booming cafy culture, it may be justified in its claims. Either way, the area has a long history as an important corridor in the city's development. In addition to upscale homes owned by former prominent city members, Tennessee Williams also wrote plays living in the area. The most notable attraction in the area is also one of the largest. The Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis towers over the neighborhood. Not merely a religious fixture, the Basilica also houses the world's largest collection of mosaic art. Built by a father and son team over the course of 80 years, there is no denying that the Basilica is an impressive anchor to the neighborhood and provides a strong draw for tourists. Also drawing in the tourists and other St. Louis locals are the shops. The Central West End Neighborhood in Saint Louis has a large collection of specialty and boutique shopping options that just can't be found elsewhere in the city. As a result, the shops are packed with people looking for that perfect thing in out of the little boutiques, or having it specially made. The shops make the neighborhood good for people watching and being seen. As a result, many restaurants and cafy stops have sprung up in the neighborhood, giving it a Continental feel while still allowing locals to feel at home. Visitors will enjoy a glass of regional wine and a sunny spot to watch the hustle and bustle. There are not many activities for children, and parking can be an issue at peak hours and during the three annual festivals. Be sure to plan ahead and take a cab into the area during the rambunctious Halloween Festival, the summer Central West End Wine and Art tasting, and the yummy Greek festival that happens over Labor Day."
"Chase Park Plaza","Missouri","Chase Park Plaza - St Louis MO - Chase Park Plaza Hotel","The Chase Park Plaza hotel in St. Louis is a four star hotel with a one million square foot footprint in the west side of the downtown district. Built by Harold Koplar, the hotel has been operating for nearly 50 years in the downtown area. It has a tradition of classic elegance and upscale amenities. The building is considered something of a St. Louis landmark due to the age of the hotel and the fact that the building also housed the TV station KPLR for a time. The large size of the hotel makes it a popular location for banquets, charity events and society balls. Weddings and conferences also take advantage of the hotel's ability to handle large groups and bookings need to be made some time in advance to get around the popularity of the place. Chase Park Plaza hotel in St. Louis offers five different dining options to guests. The restaurants are popular, with reasonable prices and a strong following from locals. The bar, Chaser's, is an especially popular destination for theater goers and movie fans who have been over to the Chase Park Plaza Cinema. Because the hotel building itself can be a destination, the location does not get deserted at night like some of the other downtown area hotels. The restaurants are busy and there is foot traffic between the neighboring attractions to put travelers at ease. Valet parking is available to complement the street parking options and provide an alternative to the local covered garages. Rooms are primarily single kings or queens, with large bathrooms and workspaces. T1 high speed internet is available along with satellite TV service. Group reservations and family packages are offered but should be negotiated with the front desk rather than booked through the website. Seasonal packages can also offer room discounts, but generally not in the summer time months."
"Chateau on the Lake Resort in Branson - Branson MO Hotel Lake Family-Friendly Convention Center","Missouri","Chateau on the Lake Resort in Branson - Branson MO Hotel Lake Family-Friendly Convention Center","Overlooking beautiful Table Rock Lake, the Chateau on the Lake resort in Branson has been referred to as The Castle in the Ozarks''. Designed by John Q. Hammons Hotels & Resorts, the Chateau has won a number of professional awards for design and innovation. It has also won over a decade's worth of travelers - Expedia listed over 112 positive reviews for the site, and TripAdvisor had more than 80 reviews, many of which gave the facility a 5/5. The Chateau is also the only 4 Diamond AAA hotel in the Ozarks. What is motivating many of the reviews? Service, plain and simple. Since its opening in 1997, the hotel has been managed by the same team, giving it a consistency that many other locations lack. Whether guests are using the convention center, the marina, or taking advantage of the children's programming, the staff receive outstanding marks for service. Naturally, the hotel itself is top of the line as well. One doesn't get nicknamed The Castle'' without cause. Built in a European style with rounded towers, the 301 room hotel features a 10 story lobby atrium with a 30 foot Swarovski waterfall chandelier. The hotel bar, known as the Library Lounge, draws 200 - 300 guests nightly. The Lounge underwent a $600,000 makeover in 2007 and showcases the lake and mountain views with leather paneling and live musical performances. However, all that posh luxury is not out of the price range for many. Many reviewers reported surprise at the affordability of their stay. That price, coupled with the superior service reported by many, leads to a high level of customer loyalty. The onsite childcare service program, Crawdaddies, is also a big point winner as parents are happy to leave the kids with the staff and head in to town for a show or out on the lake for fishing at boating. Customer loyalty and rave reviews mean that in the summer and at Christmas rooms are hard to obtain. While visitors don't have to be a guest to spend time in the Library Lounge or on the grounds, to ensure that space is available at the Chateau on the Lake resort it is best to book ahead."

Popular among locals and tourists both, the museum attracted over 600,000 visitors in 2007, and invites guests to feel, touch, climb and play among the exhibits. The City Museum was founded by Bob and Gail Cassilly, when they purchased the abandoned International Shoe building in 1993. Construction on the building began in January of 1995 and the museum opened its doors to the public on October 25th, 1997. Since being opened, the museum has continued to grow and expand. Added exhibits include MonstroCity, the Enchanted Caves, the Shoe Shaft, the Shoelace Factory, the World Aquarium and the City Lofts. The first floor is home to a life-sized replica of a Bowhead Whale and guests are invited to walk through a life sized aquarium. Also on the first floor are a series of fiberglass tunnels that run across the top of the ceiling and give the appearance of gigantic icicles. To access one of the tunnels guests can climb up a life-sized Slinky or through a tree house that takes them to a cabin on the other side. The entire first floor is covered in mosaics which run along the columns and climb to the ceiling. Through one of the tunnels guests will come to the Underground Whaleway'', which then leads underneath the floor and into the Original Caves''. The second floor connects to MonstroCity and the Enchanted Caves, to enter; guests go through an area called the Vault Room''. Bob Castilly originally got the 1800's model gigantic vault from a now defunct business located on Locust Street. Off the side of the Vault Room is an opening into the Enchanted Caves and St. George's Chamber. Within the chamber are a collection of opera posters, and a giant statue of St. George, from a catholic church in Chicago. The Enchanted Caves and Shoe Shaft run directly through the middle of the museum, the caves were man-made by Bob Castilly and his crew. Around every turn in the caves there is a different creature to greet guests and the caves were originally used as part of the shoe factory. When the museum originally opened the caves in 2003, there was only one shaft and since 2008, the caves have been expanded to include a total of ten. The third floor of the museum is home to the Skateless Factory, which is a collection of skateboard ramps without the skateboards. Also located on the third floor is the Everyday Circus, which is the only circus school in the Midwest.

"Coco Key Water Resort-Kansas City MO-Water Park Slides Family Fun","Missouri","Coco Key Water Resort-Kansas City MO-Water Park Slides Family Fun","Coco Key Water Resort in Kansas City is a family-friendly water park located inside the Sheraton Kansas City Sports Complex. Some sources may lead to the Clarion Coco Key Water Resort, but the park is the same although different area sites seem to have some confusion with the naming. It's a newer facility, but with 55,000 square feet of water park entertainments, there simply aren't two of them to be found. As part of the hotel complex, the Water Resort is available free of charge to all hotel guests with their room rate (varies between $129 - $189 for doubles). However, it is also open to the public. Several non-guests complained about the $20 per person daily rate during the week, which goes up to $25 per person on the weekend. Bargain hotel buyers with large families may find an overnight stay cheaper than a guest pass. For the money, full access is granted to the Coco Key Water Resort. Attractions include slides and entertainment options for all ages. There are areas specially designated for younger children, with shallower water, more gentle slides, and high staff levels to ensure no mishaps occur. Older children and adults will enjoy the option of high-intensity slides and wave pools as well as lazy river tubing and wading options. A new attraction is the Dip-In Theater, which is like a drive in theater but with innertubes instead of cars serving as seats. This is the latest of several multimedia features at the park. Some of the wading pools and grottos have backgrounds that shimmer and change, are musically themed, or have moving visuals. The combination of sounds, activities, interactive stimulus and hundreds of thousands of gallons of water is sure to impress and entertain even the most recalcitrant sibling into having a decent day of entertainment. Kept toasty warm year-round, the park also offers a winter retreat for those looking to recapture the days of summer during the big chill of winter."
"Compton Heights Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Compton Heights  Tower St Louis","Missouri","Compton Heights Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Compton Heights  Tower St Louis","Compton Heights Neighborhood in Saint Louis has been a restricted and planned community since its inception in the 1800s. Founded on the Northwest corner of what once a communal grazing area, the neighborhood lies between Nebraska, Shenandoah, Grand Boulevard and 1-44. Development for residential uses kicked off in the 1860s, and was mainly done by German planners and citizens. Targeted for use by wealthier homeowners, the building restrictions dictated size, style, setback, fencing and a number of other details about the homes. Rental and commercial use was prohibited, and permanent covenants adopted in the 1880's govern the look of the homes even today, ensuring that the neighborhood viewed by modern visitors looks much the same as the original plans. Most of the homes in the Compton Heights Neighborhood in Saint Louis are now on the registry of historic places. Yet over and above the stunning pre-Victorian homes are the other attractions of the area. Many visitors come every year to see the Compton Hill Tower, Pelican Building, Reservoir Park and Tower Grove Park. The Compton Hill Tower is the most visual of the three. Standing more than 180 feet high, it serves as both a symbol and water tower for the community. Built from limestone and terra cotta, it holds more than 56 million gallons of water and uses a gravity based distribution system. Since 2000, it has been restored to repair natural weathering that had deteriorated the exterior aesthetics since its construction during the McKinley years. New additions to the neighborhood include the popular Sterling's Market. Older attractions remain in service, and the primary draw continues to be the community covenants and excellently preserved period architecture. Longfellow Boulevard and Hawthorne Boulevard have some of the best houses and are popular Sunday driving destinations for locals, so tourists may want to choose another day of the week for their visit."
"Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri","Missouri","Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri","Prior to the 20th century, the Brush Creek Valley was a stop-over destination for people on the way to somewhere else. Along the banks, Indians, fur trappers and pioneers settled, and it was here that Jesse Clyde Nichols saw potential. J.C. Nichols and his roommates purchased the land during a bankruptcy sale in 1903.  After a flood, the land was the only high ground available for people to settle on. Taking the money he made from the sale of the land, he turned around and in 1907; piece by piece he purchased an additional 55 acres of swampland for over $1 million. In 1907, the first formal design plans for Country Club Plaza were drawn up. Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, Missouri encompasses a 15 block district and has over 120 different boutiques, restaurants and galleries and is one of the premier shopping locations in the Midwest. A number of pleasant surprises can be found around every corner and the plaza has a year-round calendar of events that provides entertainment and activities for all age groups. The Plaza is home to such popular draws as the Plaza Lights Show and the widely popular Plaza Arts Fair. The Plaza was designed in 1922 and is done entirely in Spanish-style architecture. Indoors there is a museum filled with European artwork that has been collected over the years. Outdoors there are fountains, murals, sculptures, a statue of Winston Churchill and replicas of two of Spain's most popular landmarks the Giralda Tower and Seville Light. There are Spanish tiled courtyards and manicured grounds that lend an air of beauty to the historical shopping plaza. In 1998, the Plaza was sold to Highwood Properties, Inc. which breathed new life and interest in the shopping plaza. In 2000, a 325,000 square foot addition was added to 47th Street, which brought in several new businesses and restaurants to the complex. The Highlands group has continued to work diligently to upgrade and improve the Plaza, while still maintaining its historical integrity and old-world charm.

"Crown Center in Kansas City - Kansas City MO Shopping center Hallmark entertainment complex","Missouri","Crown Center in Kansas City - Kansas City MO Shopping center Hallmark entertainment complex","Each year, more than five million visitors flock to Crown Center in Kansas City. The 85 acres of mixed-use space has been called a city within a city. While it can be overwhelming for first time visitors, by stepping back and examining the different elements of this massive complex it is possible to enjoy oneself while taking advantage of everything available. First, it is helpful to know why the Crown Center evolved as it did. In the 1960's, the area was a slightly seedy series of rutted parking lots. Joyce Hall and his company, Hallmark, envisioned revitalizing the area with the complex and the Hallmark headquarters forms a key anchor point of the compound to this day. Five interconnected buildings formed the initial complex, opened in 1971. Rutted parking lots have now been replaced with jammed parking lots. Crown Center in Kansas City has become one of the premier shopping and entertainment destinations. There are also 230 condominiums located in the complex, for those who need to be at the heart of everything going on at the Center. Naturally, the condos and the Hallmark headquarters are off-limits to most visitors. Instead, visitors can see the Hallmark Visitors Center, a top draw, or explore the Union Station exhibits and train station. However, if museums and exhibits fade away when presented with shopping options, then Crown Center will be a paradise. More than 60 shops and restaurants live in the three story Crown Center mall. The locally owned Crayola store is very popular, as is the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store with its on-site chocolate manufacturing facilities visible to the public. While some visitors dismiss the Center as upscale, there are in fact a number of stores catering to all kinds of shoppers. From November to March, Crown Center also offers the Ice Terrace. As Kansas City's only public outdoor skating rink, the low cost of skate rental and the smooth flat surface of the rink have made this a winter favorite for locals for more than 30 years. Skaters can come for a few hours and then retreat to some of the fun restaurants located in out of the cold, like Fritz's Railroad Cafy, where the food is delivered by train. Couples on special dates can visit the city's only four star restaurant, or enjoy some of the live jazz performances happening at the Center throughout the year."
"Crowne Plaza Hotel","Missouri","Crowne Plaza Hotel - St Louis MO - Crowne Plaza Hotel Downtown","The Crowne Plaza Hotel St. Louis downtown is a three star property with a high rise layout. The hotel has almost 350 rooms in a stacked formation so that upper stories have a commanding view of the downtown and greater St. Louis area. A rooftop pool is open seasonally with additional views from the sun deck of downtown. The hotel seems to be aimed at the mid-market and budget conscious leisure traveler. Several postings on travel sites have indicated that steep package discounts are available, and off-season room rate specials gave good discounts as well. In the summer months, the hotel's proximity to the riverfront and downtown attractions keeps it fairly well booked. The hotel is just a few blocks from the Arch, Laclede's Landing, and Busch Stadium. Most of the people who commented on staying at the hotel seemed to be in town for business purposes, although all commented on the location near the Westward Expansion Park. Parking did not seem to be an issue, as the hotel has a validation program that reduces the cost of garage parking downtown to $10/day. Airport shuttle and town car services are available, as well as nearby Metro Link access for rail riders. The fitness center was completely renovated in 2006, and most of the facilities are up to date. Rooms are medium-sized with a mix of queens, kings and doubles. Staff got good feedback from guests, especially those who had needed local sightseeing information. The hotel restaurant got mixed reviews but there are a number of downtown dining options within easy walking distance of the hotel. Conference space and business center services were available.

Shuttle service to and from the airport is available as well as town car and limousine service on request. The MAX bus stops right outside the hotel as well, making it easy for guests to get out to explore the rest of the city. Drivers complained of the parking situation, as parking ran between $10 - $15 per day. Several local garages and convention parking stations are nearby, but during a major convention or downtown event spots are pricey and hard to come by. The hotel can give recommendations, but the convenience of the location does need to be considered - lots of people like this area! There are suites and regular rooms available, with a mix of queens, kings, and doubles. The beds are sleep number beds. There is a pool, but it is only open seasonally. The fitness center is open year-round. The lounge area and bar serve as good meeting spaces, but most reported eating nearby rather than in the hotel restaurant. Room service is available. Special packages for conferences and events are available through the website, but many travelers also reported steep discounts available during the winter season through Priceline and other hotel booking sites.

"Crystal Cave","Missouri","Crystal Cave - Springfield MO - Cave Rock Formation Crystal","Visitors on travel board all over the country had two things to share about Crystal Cave in Springfield. The first was a near-unanimous enthusiasm for the exhibit followed by the warning to call first. Although the Crystal Cave is only 5 miles from Highway 44, it is still disappointing to arrive and find that the cave is closed for the day. The number to call the cave is 417-833-9599. The reason to call ahead is that the cave is a privately owned operation. Run by just two people, the cave is exhibited in its natural state during a limited set of hours which can vary. Typically, tours run 80 minutes, and happen in the mornings. Group tours can be arranged by called the cave number. The Crystal Cave has been shown continuously by the family owning the land since 1893. It is not a steep climbing experience, but there are a few tight spots to bend around and claustrophobics are warned in advance. However, inside the cave there are many areas that are quite roomy and photographs inside are encouraged. The interior of the cave has a number of unique geological features. Along with the underground waterfalls, stalagmites and stalactites, the cave has an upside down well, fossil crinoids, and a multi-hued rainbow falls. There are also climbable areas for truly unique views of the formations. As it is a smaller operation, the owners know the lay of the land intimately and can recommend good shots and places to walk for the best views and photos. The cave stays 59 degrees all the time, so visitors may want a jacket to stave off a chill. Lights will be provided, and the cave is state inspected and approved for safety. Admission for children is about half that of adults. There is a gift shop along with the museum that has a number of items that were found in the cave and in the area to collect as souvenirs of the trip."
"Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Missouri","Missouri","Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Missouri","The Dickerson Park Zoo was first established by the Springfield Park Board in 1922. The zoo was developed using funds from the Works Progress Administration in the 1930's, but during the following years, the zoo received very little development or support. As a result in 1975, the zoo had become a rundown facility and was on the verge of being shut down. A commitment from the newly formed Friends of the Zoo, resulted in the zoo being saved. The Friends organization developed a membership base and launched educational programs, which garnered support from donors for new projects and renovations. Money was budgeted from the City of Springfield, and an admission fee was instituted to assist with offset of the costs. The zoo was spared and a plan was developed to secure the future of the facility. The Master plan was adopted in 1985, and brought a new visualization to the zoo. The plan utilized geographical schemes and phased development, which addressed the mission statement of the zoo as its guiding concept. After being updated and revised, the Master Plan was finally completed in 1996, and with both public and private funding in place, the plan will be completely in place by 2010. In 1986, the Dickerson Park Zoo received accreditation by the Association for Zoos and Aquariums, and again on two other occasions, most recently in 1996. With continued growth and expansion, the zoo has experienced an increase in the number of annual visitors. Because of increased travel to the Ozarks, the zoo enjoys being another attraction for people to visit. The Dickerson Park Zoo is home to more than 500 animals that represent 160 different species. Exhibits in the zoo are themed and center around 5 geographical areas and the Diversity of Life, which showcases animals found all over the world. The zoo invites visitors to explore and enjoy a narrated walk-through'' tour of the exhibits and displays. A tour of the Dickerson Zoo begins with the South American exhibit. Here visitors can see Rheas, walk through a Chilean Flamingo aviary, view Maned Wolves and Cotton Top Tamarins. Across the boardwalk is Hamlin Lake, featuring Patagonian cavies, two species of Macaw, a pair of Toucans, a Squirrel Monkey enclosure and a family of Black-handed Spider monkeys. Upon concluding the South American exhibit tour, visitors enter Australia'', which features Red kangaroos, emus, wallabies and Black swans. At the Outback Corral, guests can feed and interact with a wide variety of domestic and protected animals in a contact setting. Other animals found in the Australia'' exhibit are kookaburras, Electus parrots and several others. Missouri Habitats is a natural forested exhibit devoted to the Missouri wilderness. The exhibit highlights the commitment between the Dickerson Park Zoo and the Missouri Department of Conservation. Guests are invited to view Black bears, coyotes, Red foxes, raccoons, bobcats, and North American river otters can been seen through underwater viewing windows. In the summer of 2004, the zoo opened the final phase of the Missouri Habitats exhibit and added Mountain lions, Gray wolves and White-tailed deer. The final representation of the Master Plan was Tropical Asia'', which opened in two phases, in 2004 and 2006. The most popular addition to the exhibit is the zoos herd of four Asian elephants, which are housed in an outdoor space with a 40,000-gallon pool and enclosure. Malayan tigers were returned to the zoo in 2004, and continue to be one of the most viewed animals at the zoo. Beyond the elephant enclosure lies an exhibit devoted to White-cheeked Gibbons, the display is open year round because of both indoor and outdoor viewing areas. In the Africa region, guests encounter exhibits beginning with Cheetah Country, Greater Kudu, European White storks, African antelopes, East African Crowned cranes and ostriches. In the adjoining African Plains Yard, visitors will see Baringo giraffes. Of particular interest is the elevated viewing platform and during the warmer months guests are invited to feed the giraffes. Once done touring the African exhibits, guests can enjoy the Diversity of Life exhibit. The exhibit is an enclosed remodeled animal nursery that features American alligators, meerkats, Burmese pythons and Aldabra tortoises.

"Discovery Center","Missouri","Discovery Center - Springfield MO - Childrens Museum Springfield","The Discovery Center of Springfield was started as a project by the Junior League women, who saw that there was a need in the community for a creative children's entertainment center that would work with the community and schools. Providing programming for children in conjunction with the other developmental infrastructure in town proved to be a very successful model. The Discovery Center underwent an expansion project in 2006. The new, expanded Discovery Center still offers many of the same things that made children love the smaller version. Extremely hands on play and learning, as well as cutting edge technologies. The museum's use of virtual technologies has won accolades and is being used as a teaching model for other children's museum facilities. As an added bonus, the building expansion was done as a green building project. That element of the building doubles as an environmental display. Throughout, there are classes hosted for students and visitors year-round. Special 8 week summer sessions for individual children provide strong ongoing learning initiatives and visitors are welcome to drop in to these classes and sessions. While there is a high staff ratio, children under the age of 16 visiting the museum must be accompanied by an adult. The museum is closed on Mondays, but offers extended hours on Friday nights until 9 pm. The museum is not open on major holidays. General admission prices are low, and the price includes everything but the high wire bike ride, which is an additional $3 fee at the moment. Exhibits and displays change regularly at the museum, insuring that there will always be something to pull children back. Now in its 11th year of operation, the museum gets consistently high marks in forums and visitor boards, making it a must-stop adventure for families traveling through the area looking for quality children's activities at a reasonable price."
"Dixie Stampede Dinner and Show - Branson MO Dinner theater music show Dolly Parton","Missouri","Dixie Stampede Dinner and Show - Branson MO Dinner theater music show Dolly Parton","Leave it to Dolly Parton to create a memorable performance. The Dixie Stampede dinner and show has been a packed house since the day it opened in Branson. The Branson location is the third venue in the franchise, which was founded by Dolly Parton in 1988 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. However, for a franchise show it retains many location specific characteristics. The Branson location features an opening act that plays bluegrass and more country western style music than the Pigeon Forge location which features a hillbilly band. Performers are also all sourced locally. Each edition of the Dixie Stampede dinner and show package starts an hour before the scheduled performance time when patrons are escorted into the area known as the Carriage House. The local opening act performs in the Carriage House until the show and dinner are ready. At that time guests are taken into the main arena for the meal and the show. The Dixie Stampede is a mix of North vs. South and `How the West was Won'. Done in the style of a revue show, the different elements blend into each other to create the overall down home feel. Live animals are used in the performance. There are 32 horses, ostriches, pigs and other animals used for races, tricks and stunts. The performers play the part of Southern belles and gentlemen for the North vs. South elements of the show and cowgirls and cowboys for the Wild West portions. Singing, dancing and humor are incorporated into all aspects of the show. The performers get very close and are interactive with the audience. The meal is a four course affair, designed to be eaten without needing utensils. Patrons who love a down home meal may want to sit a bit back from the arena, as the proximity of the performers to the audience means that the dirt kicked up by the horses can get all over front row sitters. However, this right-in-your-face element only contributes to the popularity of the show. It generally sells out each night in the summer so advance reservations are recommended."
"Drury Plaza Hotel","Missouri","Drury Plaza Hotel - St Louis MO - Drury Hotel Downtown Arch","The universal reaction to the Drury Plaza Hotel in downtown St. Louis seems to be raving praise. Either most guests have never stayed in a decent hotel in their lives, or this hotel really does go above and beyond in terms of ensuring guest pleasure. Post after post on TripAdvisor and Travelocity gibbered on about the staff, the staff, the staff . . .followed by the service, the service, the service. . . .and oh, the rooms were nice too. Naturally, this is no guarantee that your stay at the hotel will be equally life-changing. However, the Drury family of hotels is headquartered in St. Louis, so it is reasonable to expect that one of their flagship locations will deliver good quality year after year. Thousands of repeat customers are demanding it and won't accept anything less than the best. The location also makes the hotel an attractive choice for those seeking value in downtown St. Louis. The hotel is convenient to the Arch and many of the other downtown attractions. Business travelers have access to a business center and internet is available throughout the hotel for all guests. Families can also take advantage of the free continental breakfast, although they may want to keep children from loading up on the free popcorn and soda available in the lobby area. The evening reception is for adults only, as there are free alcoholic beverages on offer - up to three per guest per day. Yet this is not a party'' hotel - many guests are in town for a specific purpose or to see a game, so rowdy halls are not the norm here. Instead the rooms are quiet enough to allow guests to get a decent nights sleep in clean, comfortable dycor with an upscale flair. All for less than $100 . . . .with shuttle service to the airport as needed."

In addition, this site is used for concerts, events, and other kinds of sporting events. With seating for nearly 70,000, this dome is one of the most popular event locations in Missouri. The Edward Jones Dome is fully enclosed, so during a football game the field is comprised of artificial grass, known as FieldTurf. It was made of AstroTurf until 2004. The dome was officially opened on November 12, 1995 with a game between the St. Louis Rams and the Carolina Panthers, and the construction cost $280 million to complete. As part of the America's Center complex, the dome hosts several events every year, and some of the past events help at the dome include Big 12 Conference Championships, The NCAA Men's Basketball Regionals, The AMA Supercross, and the 2005 NCAA Men's Final Four tournament. One of the most unique events held at the Edward Jones Dome was a mass by Pope John Paul II, which was attended by over 102,000 people. The roof of the dome is fixed (i.e., non-retractable) and the floor covers over 100,000 square feet. During a football game, there are 67,000 available seats, which include upper and lower levels, club seats, and luxury suites. There are press boxes for the media, with space for up to 150 people in the main press box and smaller boxes or booths for other members of the media. The dome also has chairs that can be set up on the floor for events where a smaller space is needed for the event. There are also 13 conference rooms in the dome, which can accommodate from 50 to 1000 people each, so there is plenty of space for any event. The dome was specifically designed to be accommodating for many events, even though it was mainly built to house Rams home games.

The club level is 43,000 square feet, making it the largest in the country, and across all 120 suites there are over 2,700 seats available for fans. Alone with the Rams Club, there are a number of other concession stands that are open before and during games for fans who need food. The dome has five locker rooms for players, and the fans can follow the game by watching the two large video replay and score boards. Each of these boards is 20 feet by 26 feet, so you can see what's going on no matter where you sit. There are over 36,000 off-street public parking spaces within a short walk from the dome, and this location is great for travelers since the St. Louis airport is less than 15 miles away and easily accessible on the public transport routes.

"Fantastic Caverns","Missouri","Fantastic Caverns - Springfield MO - Show Cave Drive Through Jeep","First explored by a group of 12 women in 1867, Fantastic Caverns in Springfield has evolved quite a bit over the years. Initially merely a curious local attraction, the Caverns later served as a speakeasy during Prohibition. In the 1960's they were used as rock and roll concert halls. Later, the rough interior was further refined into the modern show form it has now. The Caverns are America's only 100% ride-through cave. The tour lasts 55 minutes, is conducted entirely in a jeep drawn tram. This makes it is for those who have been doing a lot of local exploring to sit back and just enjoy the scenery in the caves. It also avoids any potential for tripping and falling in the cave, which makes the Caverns a very family, ADA and senior-friendly attraction. The interior of the show cave rests year-round at an even 60 degrees. Somewhat humorously for locals, although seasonal visitors wouldn't know, is that the billboards advertising the caves refer to that as a cool 60 degrees in the summer time and a warm 60 degrees in the winter time. Either way, most feel it to be a very comfortable touring temperature. The Fantastic Caverns stay open year round. Tours are offered each day, and generally depart every half an hour so there will be a limited amount of time to wait between tours. The hours of operation are between 8 am and dusk, defined by whatever that is at that season. Admission is a little steeper than at some of the other show caves in the area, but much of it likely goes to cover the cost of the ride. Uniquely, for an addition small fee, it is possible to turn a single pass ticket into a season ticket to come back and try the caves over and over."

The location is very convenient for those seeking to enjoy a luxurious stay in downtown St. Louis. Out of town guests will be please that the airport metro link is just two blocks from the hotel, which along with the shuttle and town car service ensures that transportation logistics will run smoothly. The extended terrace overlooks the downtown and has a good view of the Arch and riverfront, and Busch Stadium and the casino are just minutes away. Several guests pointed out that the parking situation was tricky; downtown St. Louis is not entirely safe or convenient for parking. The Four Seasons Hotel has its own valet service as a result. However, guests noted that by parking in the garage behind the front of the building it is possible to obtain free off-street parking and duck the $24 valet charge. Inside the hotel, the rooms are well-appointed as one would expect at a five star property. The dycor is blond wood and upscale. Dining options are plentiful but pricey and received mixed customer reviews, even from those who loved the rest of the hotel. Fortunately, there are many dining options nearby so eating out is not a worry. Staying at the hotel is not recommended for those seeking child-focused ambiance.

It was originally housed in the mental hospital, but after patient numbers dwindled the hospital became a prison and the museum moved out as well. George Glore retired in 1996 but still advises the museum on his creation. Admission is low, with lower rates available for large groups. Visitors spend varying amounts of time in the museum depending if they find it intriguing or disturbing. Children are welcome but if they are sensitive the museum may be a bit much for them.

The Hamner Barber show is held is the former Braschler Theater, now known as the Hamner Barber Theater. The location has been renamed several times over the years to match the current performing act. This most recent iteration was built from a Victorian home. Construction overruns meant that on opening night in 1995 the stage was painted only hours before the first patron arrived. Nevertheless, the productions have been a consistent success allowing the theater to recover from its haphazard beginnings. The current show has two distinct elements. The first is illusion. Dave Hamner is a world renowned illusionist. His act uses live animals, fiber optics, and traditional techniques to provide first class illusions and entertainments for guests. His work with exotic birds has been a long standing feature of the performance. The second element is puppetry. Jim Barber is a ventriloquist who has been featured on the David Letterman show and in several other venues around Branson. His portion of the show, Seville and Jim Barber, features a variety of puppets including the non-traditional variety. One of the puppets appears to be holding and manipulating him in a reversal of the traditional roles. The show strives to be funny yet tasteful. Mindful of their family audience, while some jokes may be crude a filter is in force to keep them from straying to the obscene. Additionally, Dave Hamner is an ordained minister, so nothing in the theater's act will leave a family wishing they had left their children at home.

It was the first library created under the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955. It sits on a small hill facing highway 24 in Truman's old hometown, and he, his wife, daughter and son-in-law are all buried in the library courtyard. The library opens with a short film about the life of President Truman, and then visitors are invited to check out 2 floors of exhibits about the life and deeds of the former president. The amount of material the library has been able to amass or acquire is impressive. As one of 12 Presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration, the library has had more than 13,000 researchers come specifically to study its files. The library files include 15,000,000 pages of manuscript material, of which 6,500,000 are White House files. There are also 30,000 books, 112,000 photographs, 1,000 hours of audio and some 75 hours of video. Don't forget the 10,000 magazines and mountains of microfiche, either. Custodians of the library accept that most people will not be interested in seeing the whole collection.

"Hilton Promenade at Branson Landing - Branson MO Hotel Shopping Convention Center","Missouri","Hilton Promenade at Branson Landing - Branson MO Hotel Shopping Convention Center","The Hilton Promenade at Branson Landing is a top of the line entrant in Branson's hotel market. The 4-star 243-room hotel offers guests the opportunity to stay in comfort right in the heart of the popular Branson Landing complex. Visitors who are looking for a hotel with convenient shopping nearby will have to look long and hard to find its equal. The Hilton Promenade is a new hotel, opening its doors on February 14th, 2007.

Other room amenities include flat panel television screens, high speed internet, and suite-style layouts. The rooms have been designed so that an extended stay is possible.

Outside of the room, the Hilton Promenade offers an indoor pool, health club and meeting rooms for those trying to do business while the family hits the Branson Landing shops. The hotel also has a contemporary American restaurant known as Liberty Tavern. Given its prime location in downtown Branson, the hotel tends to book solid in the high season.

Rates also fluctuate based on seasonal availability and events being held at Branson Landing."
"Hilton St Louis Airport","Missouri","Hilton St Louis Airport - St Louis MO - Hilton Hotel Airport","The Hilton St. Louis Airport hotel is located just across from Lambert Field. It is a perfect stopover for business travelers and caters to the business set with free shuttle service to top area employers like Boeing, Emerson and Express Scripts. There is also shuttle service to and from the gates for guests. The hotel just completed a major renovation project, so rooms are now up to snuff for those who work on the road. High speed internet, modem jacks, flat screen tv's and thick, comfy bed sets are the cornerstone of the hotel's offerings. Children's play areas, pools, and fluffy hang out spots are not featured here. The hotel does have some well reputed dining options. The main restaurant is Veranda's, which has gotten decent marks for affordability and quality of fare. Room service is available from the restaurant. In-house catering for larger events is also available. The Hilton St. Louis Airport hotel has more than 30,000 feet of function space for conferences, retreats, or training sessions. There are 397 rooms in the hotel, and group rates for large events can be negotiated with the front desk conference planner. Business center services are also on site to support whatever needs arise from events and presentations. Specials run periodically, but the proximity to the airport makes this hotel popular year-round. Reasonable marks for service and cleanliness, coupled with the Hilton Hotel rewards program make the location very popular with road warriors. Other than the sounds of the airport, which are muffled by sound-proofing, nights at the hotel will be fairly quiet.

"Hilton St Louis at the Ballpark - St Louis MO Hilton Hotel Ballpark Baseball","Missouri","Hilton St Louis at the Ballpark - St Louis MO Hilton Hotel Ballpark Baseball","The Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark couldn't be much closer to Busch Stadium without moving into the stands. Game time means traffic jams and crowds, but guests of the hotel have the advantage of having an extremely short stroll to their seats and back to their rooms. The floor to ceiling windows in the hotel also mean that guests who arrive late can still watch the fireworks after the game without having to ever leave the comfort of their rooms. The rooms are done in a contemporary style, with modern furnishings. The hotel website repeatedly describes the location as chic and slick. Visitor postings on the major travel sites didn't say much about the styling. Room reviews focused on good standards of cleanliness, good views, plenty of space and comfortable beds. The hotel is good for groups as well as professional and business travelers. There is an airport shuttle or town car reservation service available. As one would expect of a Hilton hotel, conference space and business centers are available 24 hours a day, with all the accompanying gadgetry for presentations. Complaints about the hotel mirrored the praises. The location is fabulous for those taking advantage of the downtown without having brought a car along. The cheapest parking next to the hotel is $16 per day, with valet parking running upwards of $20 per day. Thus, carpoolers, flyers, and caravaners will get the most benefit from the location. Street parking downtown is not an option due to limited spaces and the high number of break-ins that occur. However, it is one of the trade-offs for the location - no one can have everything! Rooms can be booked to overlook the Arch as well as the field, and package deals including passes to local attractions are available in season. For more information or to book rooms call the hotel at 1-800-551-2409."
"Hilton St Louis Frontenac - St Louis MO Hilton Frontenac Hotel Wedding Shopping","Missouri","Hilton St Louis Frontenac - St Louis MO Hilton Frontenac Hotel Wedding Shopping","The Hilton St. Louis Frontenac is a mixed use hotel that offers leisure and business travelers the facilities to meet their needs. The midtown-suburban location avoids the downtown traffic while still remaining within reasonable distance of many area attractions. Washington University, the Arch, Busch Stadium and the Casino are just short drives down 64-40 away. Most noted for the large amounts of function space, the Frontenac is popular for conventions and weddings. The largest meeting room is the 10,000 square foot Ambassador Ballroom, which can accommodate up to 1,000 people. All told, there are 23,000 square feet of function space in the hotel. Catering for events is available and surprisingly good for hotel food according to posted accounts. The Hilton St. Louis Frontenac fell off the map temporarily as the main entrance spent nearly a year undergoing serious renovation. Completed in late 2008, the renovations make the main entrance a French-inspired tribute with an elevated dome and sparkling chandelier. The grand entrance road leads subtly away to the covered parking deck in the back and the expanses of uncovered parking that are behind the hotel. The large amounts of free parking available are in part due to the hotel's proximity to the Plaza Frontenac, which has many upscale retailers on site. Weekends can be extremely busy, especially near the holidays, so park carefully and try to shop at off-peak hours. School-time traffic between Manchester and 64-40 can also cause congestion near the hotel so plan accordingly. Dining and drinks are available on site, as well as hair care and tailoring. For other needs the Plaza Frontenac is just steps away, or the front desk can make arrangements to meet your needs. Families and large groups are welcome, and group rates for weddings and conferences can be arranged by working with the conference planner or the front desk,"
"Hilton St. Louis Downtown","Missouri","Hilton St. Louis Downtown","The Hilton St. Louis Downtown blends the past with the present. The hotel is located in the historic Merchants Laclede Building just a few blocks back from the riverfront and the Jefferson Expansion Memorial Park. Those in town to see the Arch or take in a Cardinal's game at Busch Stadium will find the hotel to be perfectly located to meet those needs. As with other Hiltons, the St. Louis Downtown location caters expressly to the business traveler. Just 15 miles from the airport, shuttle and town car services ensure smooth transport logistics. Valet dry cleaning offers overnight service. Free high speed wi-fi is available throughout the hotel. A full-service business center is also available, although conference space for meetings is limited. Smaller rooms are available. The hotel has a state of the art fitness center that focused on circuit training, which is popular with travelers pressed for time. There is a Jacuzzi but not a full pool. Covered parking is available to those who drive in to the area. The hotel is not particularly child-friendly. Harried travelers demand peace and quiet despite the downtown location, and there are not children's play facilities. Couples will find the hotel okay as will families with older children. Customer reviews of the location are mixed, and it seems to depend very heavily what the client was in town to do. The hotel is not a hangout location, and is best thought of as a place to leave the suitcase while heading off to explore nearby attractions. All of the downtown dining and entertainment options are at hand, so the hotel itself does not offer many dining or entertainment options. Seasonal specials can discount rooms by 20 - 30%, and package offerings for major sports events and holidays are available by visiting the Hilton website or calling the front desk. The hotel is on the corner of Olive & 4th Street, just off of I-70."
"Holiday Inn Aladdin","Missouri","Holiday Inn Aladdin - Kansas City MO - Holiday Inn Hotel","The Holiday Inn Aladdin is consistently listed in traveler's top 10 hotel choices for the Kansas City area. Located just across from the Convention Center, this 16 story building is done in the Romanesque style. Longtime visitors to the Kansas City area will also note that the Holiday Inn name replaces the Citi Centre & Plaza brand that formerly ran the hotel. The hotel earns points with travelers for a number of reasons. First is price. Looking at the downtown hotel options, there are many price points to choose from. The Holiday Inn Aladdin is a mid-market player, with occasional specials bringing the room rates down under $100 for those who are watching package deals and Priceline closely. Next is the location. Just across from the Convention Center, the hotel is within walking distance of all of the other downtown districts and the downtown attractions. Many found that this enabled them to combine business trips with leisure outings, and also made the hotel attractive to couples and families looking for a good base for a weekend getaway to Kansas City. Finally, service and convenience are also factors. Staff turned in solid performances, and the convenience of the clean, restful hotel makes an impression. The lounge area is a popular meeting place, and the martini bar is also frequently packed with locals as well as guests from out of town. This blend keeps the hotel's ambiance from seeming too distant from real'' Kansas City. The usual amenities are readily available. Pool, conference space, business center and room service all got fair marks. Parking is available at the hotel or guests can take their chances in the local garages and on the street. Group rates and special events packages are available and can be booked by contacting the front desk directly to make arrangements."
"Holy Corners District Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Holy Corne rs Church Churches","Missouri","Holy Corners District Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Holy Corne rs Church Churches","The Holy Corners District Neighborhood in Saint Louis earned its name through the construction tendencies of the town. Many similar buildings tend to occupy set neighborhoods - Victorian homes here, brick colonials there, condo complex just yonder. In the Holy Corners area, the similarity is not with construction type but with building use. The area is home to several churches of all denominations, built within sight of each other. Generally accepted as being bounded by the visual limitation of a person standing at Kingshighway and Washington, the churches and former churches offer a variety of architectural styles. Doric, Corinthian, and Ionian columns are all on display, as is a variety of steepling and cross-topping motifs. While there are no guided tours, visitors are encouraged to stop by each attraction. The Angelic Temple of Deliverance is the former Temple Israel, and features heavy Corinthian columns. St. John's United Church of Christ offers school care and a specialized black box theater inside for community performances. A spare Scientology church sits next to a Methodist church, and the Tuscan Temple brings a Doric columned finish to the group. Also noteworthy in the Holy Corners area are some former religious buildings. The Saint Louis Public Schools Recruitment office was part of the Temple Israel House before becoming a high school and then being converted to offices. The Washington Apartments building neighbors three churches and was a meeting place before being converted into condominiums in 2007. To have so many religious buildings so close together is rare, and design students often visit the area for school studies and projects. Developers have also been targeting the region, and several developments will be moving forward for multi-use buildings and apartment complexes in currently vacated properties. The gentrification project has many coming to see what Holy Corners looks like now to understand what it will be in the future or to consider it as a potential new home."

It has been operating as a timeshare resort for more than eighty years. Over that time, staff have learned how to consistently deliver a high-quality experience to guests, and repeat business is brisk. Horizons resort is centrally located. It is close to all of the city's attractions and shopping, with many theaters within walking distance. This makes it easy to restfully have a night out.

"Horny Toad Entertainment Complex","Missouri","Horny Toad Entertainment Complex - Lake Ozark - Games Dining Cooncerts","As one of the newest and most rapidly expanding entertainment complexes in the Lake Ozark region, the Horny Toad Entertainment Complex is being thoroughly vetted by locals. Attempting to offer multiple dining options, concerts, and nightclubs under the same roof, the Toad represents a new chapter in business at the Lake. In some areas the Toad seems to be succeeding beyond expectations but in others, buyer be warned. The Toad has definitely received high marks from the younger set for entertainment options. The dueling piano bar, guest performers, and the nightclub aspect have all been well received. Acts are national - Randy Travis, Steve Martin - and promises live up to the hype. The restaurants in the complex seem to be another story. While the Toad started out in 1999 as Malari's on the Lake, a fine dining establishment, that restaurant didn't resonate with locals and formats have been lurching along with restaurant names ever since. Several reviews from 2008 indicated that the perfect balance of dycor, meal, and service had not yet been found in the dining arena. The outdoor sports element of the complex does much better according to reviews. The tiki bar is much loved, and the coup Toad's got by earning the Offshore Super Series National Championship Competition bid was celebrated by all. A waterfront version of a NASCAR-type speed race, the Super Series has been growing in popularity and Toad's is happy to join them. Future expansions include building out a resort and yacht club, adding more restaurants, and working on additional shore-side play ideas. It's a large and growing complex replacing many old businesses on the 7 mile cove, and the web page speaks in glowing terms of the opportunities for Toad in the area in the years ahead. Despite stumbling blocks, the complex is likely to be a major player in the region for some time."
"Hotel Phillips - Kansas City MO Hotel Phillips Business Getaway Downtown","Missouri","Hotel Phillips - Kansas City MO Hotel Phillips Business Getaway Downtown","The Hotel Phillips is located near the historic Power & Light district of downtown Kansas City. Close to the Convention Center, Sprint Center, and all of the offices of the financial and government district, the location is suitable for business travelers or couples who want to have a weekend out in the city at a nice hotel. Reviews gave the hotel high marks, placing it in the top 10% of all hotels in Kansas City. Most visitors remarked on the high quality of the service experience. Although the Hotel Phillips is only classified as a three star hotel, a recent renovation has brought the amenities to a higher level. One couple rated the service as cruise-style pampering'' and vowed to be back again. Loyal returning customers make up a fair portion of the clientele, making the hotel hard to book in peak season and near big conference dates. The building is done in an Art Deco style, and the public spaces mix old and new to create a comfortable vibe. The 11 foot statue of Dawn in the hotel lobby and the original crown molding pull all the pieces together to create a very cohesive look, and meeting at Dawn'' is a popular hotel insider joke. The hotel has been operating since the 1930's, which has given it plenty of time to get things right. The Chophouse restaurant in the basement of the hotel is well known for its Kansas City Strip steaks, and the extensive wine and drink menu make it popular for business happy hours and post-deal dinners. The 12 Baltimore serves more casual fare and lunches, while allowing guests to watch the traffic and passer-by at street level. Valet parking is available for $15 per day, the same as the self park garages in the area. Fitness rooms and a business center are also on site for guests, along with a very extended list of maid and dry cleaning services to ensure professionals look fresh. The high-touch service also makes June busy - the historic hotel is a very popular wedding reception location."
"Hyatt Regency","Missouri","Hyatt Regency - St Louis MO - Hyatt Hotel","The Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown St. Louis is in the process of taking over the building where the former Adam's Mark Hotel was located. As part of that process the hotel is undertaking a multi-year renovation project. Travelers who visit the hotel prior to the completion of the renovations should be prepared for uneven experiences as some areas and rooms will be updated before others, and there is likely to be a certain amount of construction inconvenience. However, the Hyatt Regency, also known as the Regency Riverfront, does have quite a bit of work to do if one is to believe all of the traveler reviews. The Adam's Mark hotel transition evidently had left several rooms in poor repair; guests may want to review rooms before agreeing to stay for the night to ensure they are getting updated facilities. Also, during busy seasons, parking waits for the valet were common and alternatives were not available due to closed off areas. The location of the hotel is quite convenient to the downtown attractions. The hotel is right across from the Arch on the riverfront, giving it great views and helping those who want to catch the first cars in the morning an advantage. Busch stadium is also within easy walking distance, and the riverfront landing attractions are literally at the door. Conference space and business services are available to professionals and road warriors. Shuttle and car service to the airport can be arranged. Packages for seasonal events, games, and river festivals are readily available through the Hyatt website or by calling the hotel directly. Being in the process of upgrading, there are some deep discounts available for off-peak visitors.

The location and size of the hotel make it very popular for conferences, corporate retreats, and large wedding or social events. The interior dycor is decidedly upscale, with a lighted fountain in the lobby entrance and sculptures and local artwork scattered throughout the hotel. Rooms can face either toward or away from downtown Kansas City, offering great views. If a particular vantage point is desired, it is best to talk with the front desk in advance as depending on the season certain viewpoints are booked up. Packages related to events are available. The conference catering group has a good reputation and the all inclusive hosting makes event planning easy for professionals and amateurs alike. The conference and business center all offer high-touch support to ensure that things go smoothly. Entertainment options are everywhere at this hotel.

"Hyatt Regency St Louis Riverfront","Missouri","Hyatt Regency St Louis Riverfront - St Louis MO - Hyatt Hotel","The Hyatt Regency St. Louis Riverfront hotel is located just back from the river park in downtown St. Louis. The hotel is currently in the middle of a major, multi-year renovation project. The renovations are part of a plan to completely update the building and make it over from its previous life as the Adam's Mark Hotel. The renovations are being done in stages, so travelers will want to be mindful of the construction when booking their stays here. Judging from traveler's reviews on the major site, the hotel has quite a bit of work to do. During the hotel's final years as the Adam's Mark, several facilities were allowed to fall into disrepair, and the rooms were not updated. The current renovations are tackling these issues, but travelers may want to exercise caution and either preview a room or specifically request an updated room before committing to the hotel for the night. Regardless of the construction, the Hyatt Regency St. Louis Riverfront does have a great location for those seeking to be close to all of the downtown attractions. Right across from the Arch, guests will have good views of the monument from the hotel. As it is only a five minute walk, catching the early cars for riding to the top will not require getting up at dawn. Busch stadium is also only a few minutes away in the other direction. The rest of the downtown dining and retail attractions are literally at the doorstep, so parking and walking the rest of your stay is an option. The hotel offers business services and conference space for meetings or social functions. Airport shuttle transfers and car service can be arranged with the front desk. Promotions for river festival events and sports events are available and can be booked through the Hyatt website. Due to the construction, there are some deep discounts available for the hotel. This is especially true during off-peak seasons. Budget travelers may want to keep this in mind, but also balance the discounts against the construction. Calling the hotel for status updates on the construction will be helpful to those for whom a working pool, fitness room or conference area are a must."

"Jesse James Home Museum","Missouri","Jesse James Home Museum - Saint Joseph MO - Jesse James Bullet Killed","What people really want to see at the Jesse James Home Museum in Saint Joseph is actually turning out to be something of a false attraction. For years, visitors flocked to the Jesse James house behind the Patee Hotel to see the bullet hole in the wall where James was shot in the head by Robert Ford. The recent movie by Brad Pitt has only continued the home's popularity. For real fact finders, the famous bullet hole is nothing but a collective delusion. For many, many years guests could even touch the hole, which is now behind glass (and quite large). However, while it is a real bullet hole, it is not from the bullet that shot Jesse James. The other exhibits in the house tell the story. Some had believed the death of Jesse James was a grand hoax to allow the man to live out his life in peace. Thus, a petition was circulated and exhumation of the body was permitted so that it could be proved that the man in the grave was actually Jesse James. The dead man was, but the bullet hole wasn't. A model of his skull in the house shows no bullet hole. This had crime analysts all in a twitters. It also had the museum docents quite excited and the exhibits reflect this - a lot of care and attention has been put into presenting the life and death of the man who was famous for his crimes. To find out the true story of the bullet hole, visitors should stop by the museum daily from April - October and weekends October - March. Call ahead in the shoulder seasons to verify if the weekend rule is in effect, and call for group tour rates and options if needed. Also, satisfying curious minds is inexpensive here - adult admission is under $5 with lesser rates for children."
"Joplin Museum Complex","Missouri","Joplin Museum Complex - Joplin MO - Mining Museum Joplin","The Joplin Museum Complex is actually several museums rolled under two main umbrellas. The overall goal of the complex is to tell the story of mining in the Tri-State district. Through true to life exhibits, interactive displays, and extensive showcases of artifacts, the museums want to pass on the stories of the early days of life in Joplin. Joplin was one of Missouri's boomtowns, springing into life in the 1870's with the discovery that mining the area could be very, very lucrative. In Joplin, lead and zinc mines were dug. After many years of booming business, the commercial mining operations in Joplin ceased in the 1960's and 1970's. Left unchecked, rising groundwater has flooded all the old mineshafts, rendering them useless. Each of the museums in the complex addresses some area of the effects, both positive and negative, that mining had on Joplin. Some focus specifically on the geology of the area, like the Everitt J. Ritchie Tri-State Mineral Museum. Others focus on local accomplishments, like the Joplin Sports Authority Hall of Fame. The mix of near and far exhibits creates a broad but slightly disjointed understanding of the local industry and history. Then there are the museum exhibits that don't seem to fit. The National Cookie Cutter Museum is here, along with a miniature circus tent exhibit. Visitors to the Joplin Museum Complex definitely come away with a broad swath of knowledge after their visit. The museum complex is closed Mondays. Admission is free on Tuesdays and Fridays. Regular admission fees are nominal, and a flat fee covers and entire family. For group rates and to arrange special group tours, call ahead to the museum. Private gatherings can also be arranged. Those with animal allergies will also take note that the Joplin Museum Complex has a feline museum greeter, Percy Katz, who has the run of the entrance area."

Built as an accompaniment to the Hallmark Crown Center, Kaleidoscope focuses exclusively on children and, like the other Hallmark offerings at Crown Center, Kaleidoscope is completely free. Parents or an adult must accompany a child at Kaleidoscope, but instructors are on hand to lead families and children through creative art projects. All the materials are provided free of charge by the Kaleidoscope staff through the sponsorship of the Hallmark Corporation. More than 100 volunteers staff the center and do special events. Summer and school time programs are offered, so before a visit it may be wise to check and see if there are special sessions scheduled that a child would be thrilled to attend. Most children seem thrilled to even be at Kaleidoscope. The area was designed with children's creative process at the center, and staff just try to provide guidance while staying out of the way. All children are welcome, even if they have special needs, and accommodation can also be made for school groups, scout troops and home school meet-ups. Birthday party groups are welcome although there are no food or drink products allowed at Kaleidoscope. Parking validation is available for 3 hours by bringing the ticket into the Kaleidoscope center for a stamp. In peak times, like weekends and rainy summer days, it may be wise to think twice if crowds would be a problem for children as the center is very, very popular. Most visitors stay for 1 - 2 hours, depending how long it takes to complete a project and tour the different activity centers. Theme day programs may last longer so plan accordingly when scheduling visits."
"Kansas City International Airport - Kansas City MO Kansas City flights airport","Missouri","Kansas City International Airport - Kansas City MO Kansas City flights airport","The Kansas City International Airport is an all-civilian airport that was built in 1954 - 1956. It represented the combination of two smaller airports that had been partially destroyed in a 1951 flood. It is considered a mid-sized airport, and primarily serves as a hub and transit point for Southwest Airlines and Midwest Connection. The airport was built in an unincorporated area off a highway . . .right across from a tourist attraction commemorating the death of Buck Barrow, brother of the infamous Bonnie & Clyde robbery duo. From an RV court and camping area, a three runway air complex grew. The airport now serves more than 500 flights daily. The airport has expanded continually since it was founded. The most recent renovations were completed in 2004. While the new renovation improved the look and weather sealing of the airport, they neglected to address a basic issue for most travelers. Bathrooms were neglected. Not neglected in the sense that they are not up to date . . . .they are just in the wrong place. Travelers with children will want to be sure everybody goes to the bathroom before going through security as there are limited facilities available after the checkpoints. Kansas City International Airport is served by just one Kansas City Transit route, 129x. This bus runs 18 times a day from 6 am to 6 pm. Outside of those hours driving or taking a cab are the best options although some private bus services are available. Voters have consistently defeated measures to add light rail service to the area. Airport and regional authorities are lobbying for link rail connections into downtown, but so far nothing has come of it.

Initial planning sessions were held in 1907, with the zoo opening for business in 1909. In 2009 it will celebrate 100 years of continuous operation. In 2008 it was voted as one of America's finest zoos. The zoo has evolved over its many years of operation. It consistently refreshes and expands its offerings to maintain audience allure. From the interactive Kidzone where children can feed the animals three times a day to the IMAX theater which attracts more than 400,000 visitors annually, the zoo works hard to be successful. The zoo started with one building and a mere 60 acres of space. Today, the zoo is more than 202 acres and has over 1,300 animals. It is particularly noted for its 95 acres African exhibit. This exhibit showcases elephants, giraffes, hippos and monkeys of all kinds. Jane Goodall has been quoted as saying that the museum has the finest chimpanzee exhibit in the country. In 2006 the museum was selected as a new breeding facility for baboons and elephants. Visitors to the zoo will find that parking structures were updated in 2008. Stroller rental is available. Golf cart tours run throughout the day. FOTZ, the Friends of the Zoo, receive special admission rates and help support upcoming projects. Highly anticipated exhibits will be opening in 2009. These include the Tropics House, slated to open in the Spring of 2009, and expansions on the KidZone offerings. Also late in 2009 will see the beginning of construction of a Polar Bear House. The Kansas City Zoo runs a number of special events throughout the year for visitors. These include special feedings and visitor exhibits as well as weekend events at the zoo for adults and children.

As one of only two dedicated baseball-only stadiums built between 1962 and 1991, it was known as Royals Stadium until 1993 when it was renamed in honor of the original founding owner of the Kansas City Royals, Ewing Kauffman who had passed away in the spring of that year.

The stadium has remained operational throughout the renovation, and fans have raved about the improvements (like upgraded bathrooms) experienced already in the 2008 season. One of the biggest additions has been the $8.3 million dollar high definition viewing screen. At 84 feet wide and 105 feet tall, it was assembled in 55 separate segments. Fans have given it high marks. The park's best known feature is not affected by the renovations. The fountain and waterfall display, known as the Water Spectacular, is located behind the right-field fence. The largest privately funded fountain in the world at 322 feet high, it runs before and after the game as well as between innings. The renovations, good sightlines, and strong fan base for the stadium led to the selection of the stadium as a host location for the MLB All-Star game sometime between 2011 and 2014. With a seating capacity of 39,000 and a traditional open air layout (a roof bond failed in the polls) the stadium will provide the All-Star attendees with an excellent show. Tickets go fast. Jackson county residents are eligible for 50% off two tickets to Royals games as part of the All-Star game initiative. All others may purchase tickets directly from the Kansas City Royals website or through ticket brokers."

A race is hosted every year, however, and many do turn out for the event. Picnics, weddings, and family reunions are also regularly hosted in the park. The winter attractions, however, make the summer beauty pale in comparison. Decorated to within an inch of its life and free to the public, Krug Park is transformed into a holiday park. Lighted arches, trees, winter scenes and other adornments light up the night for miles around.

"Lafayette Square Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Lafayette Squar e Historic Park","Missouri","Lafayette Square Neighborhood in Saint Louis-St Louis MO-Lafayette Squar e Historic Park","Surrounding the city's oldest park, Lafayette Square Neighborhood in Saint Louis was created by a city ordinance in 1836. As the neighborhood developed, it became home to many of the civic and industrial leaders in the city at that time. In the 1850's - 1870's, when St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country, Lafayette Square Neighborhood was one of the preeminently fashionable areas in the country to live. Done up as mostly Victorian homes, the fashionable dycor of the era was done in grand style. A tornado in 1896 damaged many of the homes, and helped move the area from crime de le crime to has-been. By 2006, however, the has-been status of the neighborhood was gone and it was back in St. Louis in a big way. Almost all of the grand old houses have been restored, and a plethora of shops and restaurants has flooded into the area. The row houses which had spent much of the past century as tenements and low income housing are being reconverted back into trendy townhomes for professionals. Just as in the old days, neighborhood associations are a big part of life in Lafayette Square. Responsible for maintaining standards and generating entertainment and interest in the neighborhood, the community associations have done a good job at restoring a touch of class to the neighborhood. While the restored homes may never again rival San Francisco's Painted Ladies, they are a member of the same family. Visitors to the area will find that dining options are varied, with parking relatively easy to fine. Nightlife is good, with some small brew-pub well-established in the area. The proximity to downtown also makes Lafayette Square convenient for many who wish to see a bit of history while also visiting the Arch or taking in a sporting event downtown."

"Little Italy Neighborhood-Kansas City MO-Italian Food Little Italy Commu nity","Missouri","Little Italy Neighborhood-Kansas City MO-Italian Food Little Italy Commu nity","Hearing about a Little Italy Neighborhood in Kansas City, some newer residents seem surprised. Little Italy is famous in New York, but locals also know that the Columbus Park area has historically been Kansas City's Italian neighborhood. Although ethnic lines are less distinctly drawn than in years past, the unique character of the neighborhood remains, making the area well worth a stop. Unlike other Little Italys that bleed into other neighborhoods, Columbus Park has firm boundaries thanks to the Missouri River on one side and the Heart of America bridge on the other. As one of Kansas City's oldest immigrant neighborhoods, it has also had plenty of time to develop social infrastructure and culture. The main business area of this neighborhood is found along 5th street, where there are many restaurants and ethnically themed grocery shops. Retailers also line 5th street. The other heart of the community is the Holy Rosary Catholic Church. Built in 1895, the Church was the result of petitioning by the local Italian community for a church. Bells still toll on Sunday mornings and services have continued in the building for more than 100 years. Neighbors stroll into services and chatter, providing a great view for those who enjoy people watching, group dynamics, and societal studies. Some good places to stop in the area to taste and experience other elements of the neighborhood include Garazzo's Ristorante, LaSala's Deli, and LaRocca's Grocery. Traditional foods and products are sold in all of these, and visitors to the area may also want to include a stop over to Vocci's Italian Products for a further fix. The area is quite safe for walking, and families with children are welcomed. Many shops are closed Sunday mornings, but there are still many restaurants open throughout the weekend to accommodate visitors. Local residents are also more than willing to share stories about growing up in the area with those who inquire."
"Loose Park in Kansas City-Kansas City MO-Loose Park Wedding Events","Missouri","Loose Park in Kansas City-Kansas City MO-Loose Park Wedding Events","Located at the corner of 51st Street and Wornall Road, Loose Park in Kansas City is the third largest park in town. Although the official name is Jacob Loose Memorial Park, locals just call it Loose. A popular hangout spot for families and young people, the park has walking trails, ponds, reading benches, a rose garden and a meeting center. Of all the places in the park, the rose garden is by far the most popular. It is a desired prize of many area brides, who are often saddened to know that for a Saturday wedding in June it may be necessary to book more than a year in advance. Regular visitors to the park should be forewarned as well if they are planning an outing in the park that weddings, senior photo shoots, and family reunions are also popularly held at the rose garden in nice weather. The popularity of the area is causing a need for improvements, so the rose garden is slated for additional development in 2010. Fortunately, the enclosed meeting spaces in the park will remain available during this time. Enclosed spaces include 2 large meeting rooms with small kitchens attached at the Loose Park Garden Center, which is located formally at 5200 Pennsylvania drive. Parents of small children may want to be mindful of the park's many geese and ducks. Feeding the birds is a popular activity, but some of the birds are so used to getting handouts that they've developed an entitlement mentality and will chase people for bread. If a child is only bird high, a greedy Canadian goose could make an outing a tearful experience and so it is best to avoid the birds in the peak migration times. Ultimate Frisbee, Kickball, and other sports'' leagues also compete with the birds for space on the lawns. Most are organized through craigslist or community associations and are open to all comers. Playing in the park can be a great networking opportunity, especially for those new to the area."

The house on Hill Street was where Mark Twain lived for 11 years as a child and teen and got the inspiration that fed scenes into his stories for the rest of his life. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1962. A big draw for the home and museum are the accuracies between the settings and the scenes in the book. It's a real thrill to most visitors to pull up to the property and realized that the white picket fence that borders the property figured prominently in the Tom Sawyer book. The larger museum complex is actually much more than just Twain's home - there are six buildings in all. These buildings include the home of his sweetheart, the Huck Finn house, Grant's drug store, a Justice of the Peace office and the Museum Gallery. Together they form a walking exhibition that makes the books more life-like for readers visiting. The Museum Gallery has a large collection of books by Twain in their first edition format as well as a large number of personal pieces of memorabilia. The museum also sponsors many programs, especially for children. The largest is the 4th of July Tom Sawyer days, with competitions living out scenes from the book. The museum hours are longer in summer than in winter, but the museum is open every day except holidays year-round. Families with children are welcome; some displays are interactive. Admission is nearly $10 for adults with discounts for seniors, children and groups.

Twain would make the cave quite famous in his book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the 55 minute tour of the cave mentions all the scenes from the book that are used in the cave. Also, the descriptive narrative in the book has been remarked to quite accurately reflect the cave in several visitor reviews. Less attentive readers of Twain's work should note that this includes seeing bats in the cave during the tour. Cameron Cave came on the scene nearly 100 years later, becoming a show cave in 1925. The two caves are quite close to each other, and share a common campground. Cameron Cave is a bit more involved, and the average tour runs for more than 90 minutes. It is cool in the caves and suggested that visitors wear coats and be prepared for the chill. Both caves receive high marks from visitors for not being overly commercial''. The cave tours are rustic, with lantern lighting carried by participants. There are bats and rough grounds.

The wildlife enclosure can also provide opportunities to see how native wildlife once roamed the area. Seeing the few building of the town area in the midst of the larger park makes it clear that the early pioneers were bravely a real wilderness when they came west. Admission to the park is $5 for adults and $4 for children. Parking is free. The town is staffed seasonally, but generally open between April - October. A Children's Day is held in June with old-time games and activities for the younger set, including gunnysack races and a pie eating contest. For the older crowd, Old Missouri Days, a music festival with dancing and crafts, takes place in October as a season ending event and draws large crowds."

"Museum of Transportation Saint Louis MO-Museum Transportation History Train","Missouri","Museum of Transportation Saint Louis MO-Museum Transportation History Train","At the Museum of Transportation, Saint Louis visitors will be able to see historical exhibits about all kinds of transportation. From the automobile to the covered wagon, the museum has interactive exhibits that appeal to transportation junkies of all ages. While there are many exhibits that are catered exclusively to children, adults with an interest in restored trains and collectibles will also find many things at the museum to enjoy. The museum is closed on holidays, but does offer guided tours on each of the other days that it is open. Private and group tours are also available, although a non-refundable fee of $25 for the private guide is required. Admission is quite reasonable and well under $10, with children under 4 getting in to the museum for free. It may be a bit above the kindergarten crowd, although it is popular with stroller moms. Many parents have also noted that the museum tickets are bought in the gift shop, which is a hard temptation for parents with children obsessed with toys or transport gear. Chuck full of Thomas the Train gear, car paraphernalia, and plane toys, several parent boards have suggested having one parent or adult go in to buy tickets for the group rather than allowing children in the gift shop area. There will be plenty for the children to do in the grounds. Model cars, trains and planes can all be touched and driven'', and there is a mini-train ride available for a small fee. The grounds are expansive, so be prepared to walk to fully appreciate the extent of the exhibits. The museum was founded in 1944, and started with trains and retired steam engines. Initially a private venture, it is now run by the St. Louis Parks association. Funding is through private donation and gift shop purchases, and the museum also raises funds by renting out the facilities for private parties."
"Museum of Westward Expansion Saint Louis-St. Louis MO-Lewis & Clark Westward Expansion Museum","Missouri","Museum of Westward Expansion Saint Louis-St. Louis MO-Lewis & Clark Westward Expansion Museum","The Museum of Westward Expansion, Saint Louis, is one of the downtown's most overlooked attractions. Millions of visitors each year pass through the museum, but few take the time to appreciate it or even give a second glance at the exhibits. They are too busy being on their way to do something else. This is a cultural shame because the Museum of Westward Expansion has many interesting historical objects of note on display on a year-round basis. The Museum of Westward Expansion is most emphatically not simply the loading and unloading zone for the far more famous St. Louis Arch. While the Archway dominates the museum, it is not the entire museum. Being located in the basement of the famous structure does not help the Museum of Westward Expansion stand on its own, but the museum can do it. Part of what drives the Museum of Westward Expansion are the detailed exhibits of early western exploration. Items from the Lewis and Clark expedition, letters from Thomas Jefferson about the Louisiana Purchase and Native American items are all featured in the collection. Pioneer reenactments and period photographs are also on display with covered wagons, model homes, and shelves of implements used by early settlers to survive. The museum is open seven days a week, but closed on major holidays. While riding the main attraction, the Arch, can be expensive, admission to the museum itself is free. Children and adults are targeted in the displays, and short videos coupled with life-size models should be enough to keep children entertained. The many historical items provide a unique window on early American life that should not be skipped over or ignored. Seasonal programs also supplement the standing exhibits, so visitors should check for special events or offers throughout the year when planning their visits."
"Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art - Kansas City  MO Museum Asian European Art  Architecture","Missouri","Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art - Kansas City  MO Museum Asian European Art  Architecture","Built on the grounds of historic Oak Hall, visitors to the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art will be struck by large badminton shuttlecocks. Visually, of course. The installation of oversize pieces by Claus Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen is part of the renowned Kansas City Sculpture Park that fills the immense lawn of the gallery. Yet the sculpture park is one of only many worthy attractions at the museum. Founded in 1915 at the bequest of William Rockhill Nelson, publisher of the Kansas City Star, the museum quickly amassed one of the largest art collections in the country. One of the ways in which the museum expanded its collection was a series of buying sprees that started in the Great Depression, when many family collections could be had for pennies on the dollar. Uniquely among American museum gifts, Nelson's bequest had been of space and dollars rather than pieces of art. This allowed the museum to start from scratch and exercise professionally discriminating taste in its acquisitions. The result is a blend of European paintings, Chinese Imperial Art, photography and sculpture. The museum also has the largest collection of works by Thomas Hart Benton, a Kansas City native. In 2006 the photography collection took center stage when Donald Hall of the Hallmark Corporation donated the company's entire collection of photograph to the museum. Spanning 1839 to the present, it is primarily American in focus. The newly opened Bloch addition greatly increased the size of the museum. The Bloch addition was labeled a top-10 New and Upcoming Architecture Marvel by Time Magazine in 2007. While controversial throughout its planning stage, the cubed structure has proved popular with guests and the main visitor entrance has been moved to the Bloch Gallery. The museum is free everyday. Supported through bequests and donations, it is open to the public year-round. Visitors are also welcome to explore the sculpture park free of charge during daylight hours."

"Omni Majestic Hotel - St Louis MO Omni Hotel downtown arch busch stadium","Missouri","Omni Majestic Hotel - St Louis MO Omni Hotel downtown arch busch stadium","The Omni Majestic Hotel in downtown St. Louis is a four star hotel that prides itself on giving high-touch service to guests throughout their stay. As a privately owned hotel chain with just 36 properties nationwide, the hotel focuses on client satisfaction as a way to set itself apart from other non-descript chains. Based out of Irving, Texas, the hotel is an American owned enterprise. The St. Louis location is a restored nine-story building. With just 91 rooms, the hotel bills itself as a boutique experience hotel. It has a number of old-time touches mixing with the modern luxury, and the building itself is on the National Historic Register. Yet the amenities at the hotel cater to the modern traveler. There are 1400 square feet of meeting space and a top of the line business center. Airport shuttle and car service are available, as well as valet parking for guests. The valet parking is recommended by guests, as while the hotel is very nice the downtown St. Louis area is unfortunately prone to vehicle break-ins that can be avoided by having your car in secured parking with an attendant on duty. Indeed, the parking is really the only complaint about the hotel, other than its limited amenities for children. The upscale furnishings in the rooms, which include Italian marble, invite guests in for a restful and luxurious experience. Management is ready to respond to every need, and the manager also makes a point of following up with guests who post on the message boards to acknowledge praise and fix any lingering dissatisfaction that prevented the hotel from earning top marks. Those who do choose to go out will find that the hotel is within walking distance of all the downtown attractions. The Arch and Arch park, Busch Stadium, Union Station, and the riverfront area are all easily accessed from the Omni Majestic Hotel. Budget conscious travelers can watch as well for the off-season deals that occasionally offer 40 -60% off the nightly rate."
"Optical Science Center and Museum","Missouri","Optical Science Center and Museum - Hannibal MO - Glasses Optics Museums","Uniquely, this is the only museum in America dedicated to optics. The Optical Science Center and Museum in Hannibal is a one of a kind museum. With more than 4,00 square feet of displays and interactive media, the museum can easily be a 2 - 3 hour visit. Located just blocks from the Mark Twain Boyhood Home, the Optical Center has more than 500 pairs of spectacles on display. Many can be tried on and several are novelty items.

The light show is one of the many optical tricks that can be experienced at the museum. Optical illusions and eyes are also scattered throughout the museum. Visitors are encouraged to try each one. The museum promotes a hands-on learning environment, so giving each activity a fair try will provide a great deal of learning as well as laughter as visitor after visitor falls for the same visual ploys.

The museum is not open in the winter season or during major holidays, except by special appointment or for private events. The open season runs from April to October and the regular museum hours are 10 am to 6 pm, Monday through Saturday. Admission prices vary season to season, with discounts available to children, student groups, and seniors. Large groups will want to call ahead to make sure the museum is prepared. Reviews of groups have given mixed feedback as tight timeframes make it hard for everyone to play with the different illusions, so be sure to give the museum a couple of hours if there is a big crowd."
"Osage Beach Premium Outlets","Missouri","Osage Beach Premium Outlets - Osage Beach MO - Shopping Sale Outlets","The Osage Beach Premium Outlets may be located in tiny Osage Beach, MO, but don't let the tiny town fool you. This is a serious shopping destination. With Osage Beach's location on the shores of Lake of the Ozarks, hundreds of thousands are shopping here each year. The Outlets have more than 110 stores, arranged in an indoor/outdoor configuration. It's designed to give the outlets a village look that many shoppers have reported they found pleasing. Less pleasing, of course, is the traffic. Peak summer weekends will have brisk crowds competing for space in the parking lot and in line at the shops. The outlets are managed by Chelsea Premium Outlets. It's a chain that targets more upscale, fashion conscious consumers. The mix of stores at the mall reflects their desire to attract a more brand-savvy shopper. Brooks Brothers, Nautica, Nine West, Gucci, Guess and Giorgio Armani are just a few of the brands that can be found at the outlets. Savings reports vary, naturally. Some claim that the Osage Beach Premium Outlets are little different than mall prices back home, while other claim to have gotten steals at 60 - 70% off. As marketers and retailers continue to get more market savvy and personalized with their selling techniques, who's to know? Whatever the price, the selection will have shoppers drooling as it is rare to see so many different kinds of brands and stores together in one place. The shopping mall can also be a welcome break from all of the Lake of the Ozarks outdoor activities. As a way to balance a vacation between playing hard and just playing, the relaxed atmosphere and cozy look of the shops will be a comfort. Open year round, the summer dusk among the cottaged-roofs shops is particularly lovely. Visitors will feel right at home."
"Patee House Museum","Missouri","Patee House Museum - Saint Joseph MO - Pony Express Patee House","Over the years, the Patee House Museum has never quite fit into a traditional museum mold. It's just got too many interesting things stuffed inside. Visitors stop in thinking that they will be seeing a quick tour of a former hotel, and realize that they have stumbled on something truly unusual and fascinating. Review after review mentioned the Oh Wow'' that they felt over something in the museum. The outside is a bit oh, yawn. It fools people. A former luxury hotel, the Patee House Museum is famous for two reasons. One, Jesse James is connected to it. Two, the Pony Express used it as a headquarters. Three, the fourth floor was a sanatorium for epileptics. Four, they have a working hangman's gallows. Five . . . oh, right. Just two reasons for fame appear on the nice but unassuming four story stone and brick exterior. Inside? Visitors don't see it coming. Children will enjoy the museum, as there are pieces that can be touched and played with throughout the museum. A full-size steam locomotive is on display (they had to dig a special pit) as well as a collection of steam whistles that can be played by guests. Children will also enjoy comparing themselves to the true to life portrait of giant Henry Wadlow. Adults will likely want to see the gallows, collection of murder weapons from history, the Olympic torch and the Pony Express exhibit items. Tours can be guided or self-led, and staff are reported to be full of information and stories. Tickets are extremely reasonable at less than $5 for adults and $3 for children. The only inconvenience is the change in hours for the Patee House Museum between summer and winter - summer hours are longer and cover more days of the week, while winter hours are sometimes weekend only. Call ahead to verify or if a group tour needs to be arranged."

"Precious Moments Park","Missouri","Precious Moments Park - Carthage MO - Precious Moments","The Precious Moments Park in Carthage is home to what many consider to be the Sistine Chapel of the United States. With more than 9000 square feet of biblical artwork painted on its walls, the Precious Moments Chapel is considered to be the centerpiece of the park. It was built by Samuel J. Butcher, the father of Precious Moments, in 1989. Mr. Butcher says he was inspired by the Sistine Chapel to build a work of hope, love and inspiration in Carthage. The Chapel remains a very inspiring architectural work, touching even those who have no taste for Precious Moments' style of drawing. Yet the Chapel was but one piece of a larger set in Mr. Butchers dream of a large and moving park. There was a museum of Butchers work as an illustrator, a Wedding Island, an RV Park, and the Fountain of Angels. The Fountain of Angels operated from 1989 to 2007, when Precious Moments International had to scale back many of the features of the Park due to financial issues. It had been a bronze fountain of Precious Moment's Angels that shot water as high as 80 feet into the air and danced it about to lights and music. The twice daily shows were deemed too expensive to continue. Currently, the biggest draw to the park remains the Chapel, and there are now few other things to compete with it save a museum to Mr. Butcher's work. However, the financial changes do make it possible for the Precious Moments Park and the Chapel to be free to the public. There are winter and summer hours for the park, with winter hours generally about half of the summer hours offerings. The Park is open every day except Christmas, Easter, New Years and Thanksgiving. Sorry, no photo on stock - PM Stuff is so protectively branded there was no hope."

Some of the exhibits include: Puppets: Depression thru Recession, Hazelle Puppets & Memorabilia, History of Punch and Judy Display, Robert LeRoy Smith Display and New Toy Theater Exhibit. The Puppets: Depression thru Recession exhibit features marionettes that were created by W.P.A. artists that worked at the Nelson Atkins Museum from 1934 to 1937. They were loaned by Jean Baldwin who worked at the museum teaching marionette classes in 1942. They used these puppets in plays that featured Chinese, Greek and Egyptian stories. Hazelle Rollins had a marionette factory in Kansas City and began teaching marionette classes in the area in 1934. Today's museum is named after Hazelle Rollins in honor of achievements she made in puppetry. Some of the featured performances that have been held at the Institute include: The Magic Doll which lets visitors imaginations emerge.

"Q Hotel & Spa","Missouri","Q Hotel & Spa - Kansas City MO - Hotel Spa Wesport","The Q Hotel & Spa in Kansas City is located in the Westport District, not far from the Country Club Shopping Plaza. The hotel is a boutique offering, with just over 100 rooms for guests. It was formerly known as the Quaterage hotel, and is a low rise building with only four stories. The hotel has been recently going through a series of updates which are being positively received by guests. As part of the updates, the hotel is more fully embracing the green movement. It is a certified Eco-Plan green hotel already, which means that guests will find a number of environmental measures in place. The bathrooms, for example, have soap dispensers with Aveda products rather than the little plastic bottles of amenities, and real glassware is always used instead of paper offerings. In addition to its green focus, the hotel is also known for its Day Spa. The facility offers nail care, facials and massages to guests and locals. Pampering packages with special room rates are also available. Another new offering post-renovation is the Qwench bar in the lobby area. It serves as a coffee stop and cafy during the day and turns into a full service bar at night. There is a partnership in place with the Boulevard Brewery to ensure that the local beers and microbrews are available throughout the year. Guests gave it decent reviews but many had come to the area to explore and so headed out for local restaurants rather than eating in the hotel. A complimentary cooked to order breakfast is available, although the chef is reportedly a bit testy. Have your order ready as you approach - this a.m. guy is no morning person. Shuttle service can take guests to the airport or over to some of the convention center destinations, making the hotel a good choice for business travelers as well as weekenders."

The lobby restoration is part of a large rehabilitation project going on in stages at the hotel that began in 2008 and will be continuing for the next few years. Calling ahead to discuss rooms, guests can specifically request to be in updated suites. Rooms are available as a suites or standards. King beds or doubles are the only options. Bathrooms in the un-refurbished areas of the hotel were labeled as small by many guest reviews, but new bathrooms are more spacious and accommodating. The public areas of the hotel got high marks, although most visitors preferred to be out exploring the surrounding Westport shopping and entertainment area instead of staying in the hotel. Business services and limited numbers of conference rooms are available. The hotel is a good choice for those attending a conference nearby, but not suitable for hosting a large conference gathering of your own. Staff received good marks for friendliness and knowledge of the area. Restaurant and shopping recommendations were well received by guests in reviews. Also, many guests remarked that despite the on-going construction, noise from the renovation process is minimal and the hotel is taking pains to ensure that guests are not inconvenienced by the process. Uniquely for central hotel locations, the Raphael Hotel offers guests free parking. Shuttle services are available for those heading to the Convention Center, Sprint Center or airport, and town car services can also be arranged. Live music is hosted in the Raphael lounge each weekend, and there is an onsite restaurant as well. There is a fitness center but not a pool area. The hotel is less kid-friendly than some, but does make a good retreat for couples and business professionals."

It is convenient to the Landing at the riverfront and to the stadiums. Due to the weather conditions and the nature of the downtown area, however, most travelers reported that exploring the downtown area from the hotel was best done in the summer months or when baseball was in session. Otherwise, much of the office district is quite empty in the evening hours. Dining options are limited, so reservations at one of the downtown eateries will need to be arranged through the front desk. Staff got good reviews for the most part, and travelers with children said that the extra effort was made to make the little ones feel welcome at the primarily business-oriented hotel. Aimed at up-market business types, there are not many entertainment options built in for young children. Extensive conference space is available at the hotel and it is popular with trade conventions. Most who reviewed the hotel were staying there for business and recommended it to other business travelers or to couples looking for a downtown getaway. Several commented on the amazing views. The Renaissance St. Louis Grand & Suites height and central downtown location means that the river, Archway, downtown and greater St. Louis all are viewable from different rooms at the hotel. To request a specific view, call the front desk. Rooms are well-appointed, with appropriate work spaces and flat screen tvs. Bathrooms have modern furnishings; some women noted a lack of counter space in the bathroom. Many travelers of all types complained about an internet charge, but this seems to be the norm for the downtown hotels. Valet parking is available as well as car service. Shuttles to and from the airport can also be arranged by talking with the concierge."
"Renaissance St Louis Hotel Airport - St Louis MO Renaissance Hotel Airport","Missouri","Renaissance St Louis Hotel Airport - St Louis MO Renaissance Hotel Airport","The Renaissance St. Louis Hotel Airport is one of the closest hotels to the gates. However, the U-shaped design of the hotel deflects most of the airport noise. This allows guests to get the convenience of being practically at the airport without having to sacrifice a decent nights sleep. There are many other elements of the hotel where travelers do not need to sacrifice. Unlike many airport hotel locations, the Renaissance St. Louis Hotel Airport has multiple pools and a Jacuzzi so that travelers can enjoy a nice swim and soak after a long flight instead of being shut up in little hotel boxes. Many travelers commented on the expansive design of the hotel, which created a feeling of spacious openness throughout the property. The spaciousness extends to the rooms. Bathrooms got high marks for roominess, and king beds seemed to outnumber queens in the reviews. Several travelers commented that the work space in the rooms was more than adequate. However, as seems to be the norm with the airport hotels, the Renaissance charges $10 a day for internet (noon to noon) which annoyed every class of traveler. Most felt this should be free, especially given the other amenities at the hotel. On-site dining is available. There is both a sports bar and a regular restaurant menu. The sports bar seemed to be a popular hangout spot in the reviews of the hotels. Many cited reasonable prices, good ambiance, and more than edible fare when discussing their use of the sports bar. The shuttle to the airport runs 24 hours a day. It usually swings by every 10 - 15 minutes. Most guests found this to be sufficient and noted that it was about a 10 minute ride from door to door. Car service is also available if necessary and can be arranged through the front desk."
"Ritz-Carlton St Louis","Missouri","Ritz-Carlton St Louis - St Louis MO - Ritz-Carlton Luxury Hotel","The Ritz-Carlton St. Louis is a major player in the local luxury hotel market. While the outside of the downtown location may be unassuming, upon entering the doors the legendary Ritz-Carlton opulence emerges. The public areas of the hotel are extremely well-appointed, and the lobby is a very popular meeting spot for the see and be seen set. Rooms are spacious. The beds feature Frette linens, which first time sleepers raved about to an unnerving degree - linens are, after all, simply sheets. Yet, as with many things at the Ritz, they are simply the best sheets, so perhaps all the praise is warranted. Morning and evening room service is designed to keep the rooms fresh and welcoming for guests at all times. Given its status as a luxury leader and the prime downtown location close to many other up-market retailers, there were a large number of service complaints on the various travel review sites. Many focused on elements of cleanliness and responsiveness from the staff. However, potential guests evaluating the hotel should remember that the Ritz-Carlton clientele on average can be quite exacting and demanding in their standards. Catering to a demanding crowd, the Ritz does offer a two story state of the art fitness facility. There are all manner of aerobic machines, weights, circuit training and treadmills in one area, with the steam room, refreshment area and towel room in another. Even in peak hours the facility is large enough to allow everyone space to work out at their own pace and in relative seclusion. Valet parking is available, as well as covered parking nearby. The hotel has its own dining options, but with its Clayton neighborhood location many guests preferred to explore area offerings instead of the hotel restaurant. Room service is available at all hours for late eaters."
"Rockcliffe Mansion","Missouri","Rockcliffe Mansion - Hannibal - Bed Breakfast Castle Rockcliffe House","Saved by the barest of margins from complete destruction, Rockcliffe Mansion in Hannibal is a 30 room boutique hotel. It was built as the home of Mr. John J. Cruikshank in 1900. Mr. Cruikshank was an timber baron, who had the house constructed of the finest lumbers money could buy for his wife and their four daughters. After their deaths, the house stood empty for 43 years, and was within 2 weeks of being torn down when local families rescued the building and began to restore it to its present state. Visitors will be impressed with the soundness of the construction - even more than 100 years later, it is obvious that no expense was spared in getting the finest stone and hardwoods into the house. Considered by many to be an American Castle, the house is 13,000 square feet in size. It sits on a rock cliff overlooking the city of Hannibal, and gets its name from its position. The current owner is Rick Rose, who operates the castle as a mixed use entertainment and boutique hotel site. Tours are available weekend afternoons, with group rates and senior discounts available. Holidays are done up to the nines at the house, with both a ghostly Halloween event set and sumptuous Christmas displays.

"Saint Louis Zoo","Missouri","Saint Louis Zoo - Saint Louis, Missouri - large zoo with thousands of animals","The building of the Saint Louis Zoo began in 1904 when the city of St. Louis purchased the 1904 World's Fair Flight Cage after the Fair's closing. That touched off an interest in creating a zoo and park in St. Louis. That interest came to fruition in 1910 with the establishment of the St. Louis Zoological Society and the Zoological Park. In 1916, the citizens of St. Louis voted to fund the zoo through a mill tax, making it the first zoo in the world to be supported by the citizens by the passing of a tax specifically for the building and upkeep of a zoo. From those small beginnings, the St. Louis Zoo has grown to international recognition as a leader in animal management, conservation and research. The Zoo has been named the #1 Zoo the U.S. Travel Guide published by Zagat's in conjunction with Parenting magazine. It hosts over 3,000,000 visitors per year and is home to over 18,000 animals between 700 different species. The animals are housed in natural habitats built in the center of Metropolitan St. Louis. The habitats include the River's Edge, an exhibit that spans four continents in an immersive environment that covers 10 acres. Visitors follow a trail along a winding river that gradually shifts environments from the South American rain forest through the African Savanna, to the African Nile to Asia and then to North America. The exhibit is a one-of-a-kind experience that takes visitors to such diverse venues as a back porch along the Missouri River for a lesson on big river floods and global warming or an Asian ranger base where visitors follow the adventures of a ranger finding ways that villagers and elephants can co-exist. The River's Edge is only one of the intricate, mixed species exhibits whose purpose is as much education as entertainment. Rather than focusing on one particular animal or species, many of the exhibits at the Saint Louis Zoo tell the story of an entire bio-community. In the Red Rocks area, for instance, zoo staff mix and manage some of the world's most powerful predators and its most beautiful and graceful prey in an environment that is home to them both - an African savanna. They do this by separating the animals into two territories - Big Cat Territory and Antelope Territory. The Antelope Yards house such exotic animals as oryx, addax, gorals and giraffes. Among the residents are Grevy's zebra, an endangered species. In addition to the exhibits, the St. Louis Zoo offers numerous programs for individuals, families and groups. They include a unique Keeper for a Day'' program in which 2nd to 8th graders join the zookeepers for a day of work, including a staff meeting, feeding the animals and cleaning out cages. Children can also spend a day with the stingrays in the Rays of the Caribbean exhibit, or work with the sea lion trainers for a day. Other programs include more typical fare like overnights at the zoo and outreach classes with animal ambassadors. The Saint Louis Zoo is open year round except Christmas and New Years Day. Hours are seasonal, with variations for special events. General admission is nominal, but some attractions require a separate admission. A Safari Pass is available that includes most of the featured attractions for one price. For more information about admissions, hours and special events, contact the zoo at 800-966-8877."

The arena officially opened in 1994, with the City of St. Louis as the owners. Scottrade Center was built to offer the St. Louis Blues a home base. The Blues are a NHL team. Inside the arena are 9- second foghorns, which will blast after the team makes a goal. In fact it will blast When the Saints Go Marching In.'' The arena is not just for ice hockey though. It has hosted and will host more performances in wrestling, concerts, ice shows, and other sporting events. Each year the venue puts on 175 or more shows serving more than 2 million people. In 2006 the facility was ranked second in US arenas and 4th worldwide for ticket sales. The Scottrade Center is definitely a place to see shows in the mid west. Scottrade Center provided a home for the Saint Louis Bilikens NCAA, Saint Louis Steamers, Ambush, Stampede, Vipers, and River City Rage. The teams were MSL, NPSL, AFL, RHI, and NFL respectively. The most the arena has ever seen at one time was 22,612 people for the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament or Arch Madness as it is referred to locally. The center is part of a grouping of entertainment facilities. The Kiel name is still used on the adjoining Opera House. The opera house was built in 1992, several years after the arena. Scottrade bought the naming rights in 2006 for the arena portion. There have been a number of notable events at the Scottrade Center. For example Frank Sinatra performed his last concert at the arena to open the center. The WWE and WWF held such events as the Badd Blood: In Your House, Survivor Series, No Mercy, Judgement Day, and Raw. Pope John Paul II was at the arena for the 1999 Youth Day Celebration. Alice in Chains, Braggin' Rights, Conference USA, Women's Final Four in 2001 and 2009, and Cory Spinks versus Zab Judah are some of the other events that have been held at the arena. A few acts that will be arriving at the Scottrade Center for 2009 and 2010 include the Ringling Bros. Circus, Bruce Springsteen and Miley Cyrus. The facility tries to keep top named acts visiting in between the sporting events held each year. Scottrade Center has over 40 concession stands throughout the concourses. Some of the stands are portable carts on the plaza and mezzanine levels. Hot dogs, nachos, peanuts, pretzels, toasted ravioli, chicken wings, and hamburgers are some of the foods that are served.

"Sight & Sound Theaters in Branson","Missouri","Sight & Sound Theaters in Branson - Branson MO - Christian Musical Shows","Newly opened, the Sight & Sound Theaters in Branson continues the tradition of quality family entertainment that has come to be associated with the area. The theater offers unique Broadway style musical productions with a Biblical theme. Marketed explicitly at Christians and families, the high quality of the productions will have even those outside the target market lining up for a show. The theater opened a month ahead of plan in May of 2008. Undeniably massive, the theater is 339,000 square feet with a stage area of 26,550 square feet and seating for 2,085 patrons. This makes the Sight & Sound Theaters in Branson one of the largest performing stages in the world. The size of the stage is not the only element that has been delivered on a large scale. The company's first production, Noah: The Musical, uses state of the art technology and top-notch theater effects to create a realistic feel. Set on a 300-foot stage that wraps around three sides of the theater, the production has 40-foot high sets that tower over the audience. Hundreds of live and animatronic animals make up the ark, and some of the live animals are even led through the audience as they are loaded on the ark. The show has proved so popular that there are no signs that it will be ending its run anytime soon. If it does, the Sight & Sound Theaters in Branson could easily launch one of the shows perfected at its sister theater in Pennsylvania or something from the back list of the company. Founded in 1975, Sight & Sound Theaters typically has more than 800,000 patrons a year, with the Branson addition bringing total viewership to more than a million souls annually.

The wrap-around stage means that seating placement is less of an issue than in traditional theaters, but to experience the live animals up close it is recommended that an aisle seat be selected."
"Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri","Missouri","Silver Dollar City in Branson, Missouri","The Silver Dollar City amusement park is located in Branson, Missouri.  Silver Dollar City was founded by a family from Chicago; the family leased a cave in the Ozarks to develop a summer cave touring business in the 1800's. By the 1920's, the cave became one of the top tourist attractions in the Ozarks. The cave was then sold again in 1946 to the Herschend family. The Herschend family then improved access to the cave and surrounding above ground areas. In 1954, a man named Charlie Sullivan visited the cave. Sullivan informed the family that the area around the cave had once been a mining town in the late 1800's. After searching the property, the family found remnants of foundations of the buildings. The idea to recreate the old mining town was then born. The Herschend family began construction on the buildings in 1955. The structures were built to be as authentic as possible, and the family insisted on preserving the natural beauty of the area, specifically the trees on the property. The replicated town has an ice cream parlor, blacksmith shop, general store and a doll shop. The family had two log structures built in the 1800's moved to the sight. The McHaffie homestead and the Wilderness Church are two of the many buildings and structures popular among visitors to Silver Dollar City. In 1960, the Herschend family opened the village to the public for the first time. They called the park Silver Dollar City after the promotional idea of giving silver dollars back to patrons as change. The gimmick worked and word of mouth spread about Silver Dollar City. The first year alone, the park attracted 125,000 visitors. The theme park was well on its way to becoming one of the most popular attractions in the Branson area. The park showcases American heritage crafts by more than one hundred resident craftsmen. The craftsmen demonstrate how to make candles, carve wood, blow glass, and work with leather and knife making. Guests to the theme park are invited to witness true craftsmen at work and can purchase the wares as souvenirs. Silver Dollar City is a sprawling fifty-five acre theme park that has many exciting rides for visitors to enjoy. The Powder Keg is an explosive launch rollercoaster that goes from 0 to 53 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. The Wild Fire rollercoaster is multi-looping and speeds riders up to 66 miles per hour around its many twists and turns. Rollercoaster's are not the only rides in the park. Silver Dollar City also has a steam train, water rides, and other thrilling rides to experience. Silver Dollar City over the years has become one of the top tourist destinations in Branson, Missouri.

Over 10 different roller coasters have operated in the park over the years, with one of the most notorious/sought after being the Screamin' Eagle, which opened as the biggest, longest, and fastest coast in 1976 and remains a top draw for those who need a heart rate boost. Not wanting to rely on just one attraction type, the park has also opened theaters and hosts concerts annually to draw crowds to the park in the evening hours. Opening in the morning, most visitors stay until dusk and then leave unless there is a show going on that night, so to fill seats and sell the park space more thoroughly concerts now happen at least once a month.

Daily passes are upwards of $30, while seasonal passes are around $70. Ample parking is available at the park, with shuttle service available for those who park farther from the main entrance."

Operating continuously on Wednesdays - Saturdays, the farmers market has seen the neighborhood have its ups and downs. That's a good thing - if Soulard hadn't gone through ups and downs, the neighborhood known for its blues might have made another kind of music entirely. The neighborhood is named for Antoine Soulard, the Frenchman who surveyed St. Louis for the King of Spain, and at times has held the nickname of Frenchtown''. Each year certain French traditions are observed, like Bastille Day and a massive Mardi Gras celebration. However, the French roots don't run that deep, because the fall Oktoberfest is celebrated with equal enthusiasm. Most of the festivities take place in the streets. Just five minutes from downtown, the homes are compact in the old French style. Done up in a distinctive red brick, colonial and Italianate style predominate. The public square was donated to form a market square, so locals get good use out of it by doubling it as a concert and festival space. The late 80's and 90's have also seen a decided effort to re-gentrify the area. It had fallen down a bit over the years. Revitalization efforts have brought in a number of restaurants and pubs, giving the area a lively nightlife that pulls in young people from across the city. As with many areas close to downtown, parking is an issue at times and traffic can be brutal at rush hour. However, the large number of eateries means that there is no reason not to wait out the rush hour with some famous St. Louis BBQ and listen to some home-grown blues. The trumpets and saxes still mix in live music shows all over the neighborhood, ensuring that the old Frenchtown will continue to be (Soul)ard."

"St. Louis Walk of Fame-St. Louis MO-Walk Of Fame Stars","Missouri","St. Louis Walk of Fame-St. Louis MO-Walk Of Fame Stars","The St. Louis Walk of Fame commemorates and honors individuals with a St. Louis connection who have made major contributions to the culture of the United States. Some of the individuals featured on the walk were indeed born and raised in St. Louis, but for many others the city was either a fruitful working time, a performing venue for a major work, or a place of inspiration. The Walk is the work of developer Joe Edwards. He started the Walk in 1989 along the area that is known as the University Loop. Uniquely for a star project, the commemoration does not just feature a name and a star. The commemoration also comes with a brass plaque embedded along with the star that explains the nature of the achievement that earned the recipient the star. To get the Walk started, the early years honored 10 annual selections in a May ceremony. Recent years have seen that number fall to 2 or 3 honorees each year, with the ceremony held whenever the honoree can make it to St. Louis. More than 120 names are currently featured as part of the Walk. Due to the fact that the St. Louis Walk of Fame has a strong educational component in the plaques, doing the walk has become a popular activity with school groups, tourists, and locals with visiting relatives. The connections of each nominee are typically discussed in depth along with the nature of the achievement, and the speculation for who will be added each year swirls in the city's coffee shops for months ahead of the announcement. Doing the walk is free and guides are readily available on the internet and through shops located along the walk. Expect to need comfortable shoes, as the walk does get long for those who are not used to extended jaunts. Even though it is tiring, young children do seem to greatly enjoy the walk, so it can really be a whole family activity."

"The Arabia Steamboat Museum in Kansas City, Missouri","Missouri","The Arabia Steamboat Museum in Kansas City, Missouri","Navigating the muddy waters in Missouri has never been an easy task; imagine how it must have been back in the early 1800's. Steamboat captains had a perilous journey as they guided their craft along the dark and murky waters. There were rocks, fallen timber and many other obstacles that lay in wait under the treacherous waters. Built in Pennsylvania in 1853, the steamboat Arabia was 171 feet long, 29 feet wide, and had a weight capacity of 222 tons. With 28 feet tall twin paddle wheels, the steamboat could reach upstream speeds of 5 miles per hour. The steamboat was a wood burner and used over 30 cords of wood per day while traveling along the river. The Arabia steamboat made several visits up and down the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The boat carried cargo and passengers up and down the river to the many different towns. Prior to sinking the ship had made a total of fourteen visits between St. Louis, Missouri and other frontier towns between March and August of 1856. The steamboat hit a snag and sank beneath the waters of the Missouri River on August 30th, 1856, and there it lay hidden for more than 132 years. On November 7th, 1988, the boat was carefully lifted out of a cornfield near Parkville, Missouri, with a 100-ton crane and now the remnants which have been painstakingly restored are on display at the Arabia Steamboat Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. At the museum, visitors will see an original 6 foot section of the boat, complete with watermarks and the remaining white paint. The museum has a full-scale reproduction of the boats main deck which allows visitors to marvel at the sheer size of the steamboat. The Arabia's original boilers and large engine are also intact and part of the display. There is a replica 28 feet tall paddlewheel which turns into a pool of water and there is a skeleton of the mule, the only life that was lost when the steamboat sank. There are also displays of the cargo that was recovered from the Arabia. Such items include the dishes, trunks, pictures and many everyday items as well. There are bottles that were recovered from the wreckage that include eye glasses, inkwells, medicines, bells, pie filling, catsup and pickles. Fabrics, buttons, needles, threads and various sewing supplies are also featured in an exhibit. All of the items recovered were bound for general stores and pioneer settlements, up and down the Missouri River.

"Truman Home","Missouri","Truman Home - Independence MO - Truman President Home","One of the more interesting elements of the Truman Home in Independence is that while it is preserved as the home of Harry S Truman, it was not, initially, his house at all. In fact, though he lived there for much of his life, he did not own the home until quite late in life. In the modern age where more than 60% of Americans own their own homes, Mr. Truman did not have the money to buy a house until long after he had left office. The Truman home is also called the Wallace House, because it came into the family from his wife's (nee Wallace) side of the family. Truman and his wife lived in the house after they were married, with his mother -in-law. After he left office, the Wallace house served as the post-presidential office until the Truman Library was finished. The multi-story Victorian home was special to the Trumans, however, as it was where their only daughter was born in 1924. Even after his wife's mother passed away and they could have gotten rid of the house, they kept it and lived in it. Guided tours now show how they lived and there are photographic exhibits showing how the house was changed and modified over the years. The Wallace House forms part of the larger Harry S Truman National Historic site, which includes some neighboring homes and the farmhouse where Truman was a boy. The large site is administered by the National Park Service, and tours are available everyday except Monday when the house is open but no guides are on staff. The Truman Home is also closed on major holidays. Large group tours and rates can be arranged by calling ahead and making the appropriate arrangements.

"Union Station Theater District-Kansas City MO-Movies Theater Musical Uni on Station","Missouri","Union Station Theater District-Kansas City MO-Movies Theater Musical Uni on Station","Closed Mondays, the Union Station Theater District spends the rest of the week putting quite the show . . . .dozens of them, in fact. Mixing movie screen with traditional stages, the Theater District offers something for everyone who likes a performance. Unlike single-stop theater areas, if the opera doesn't thrill one can always duck over to the latest blockbuster. And the Theater District does know how to show a movie. The five-story Extreme Screen is more movie than one may ever see again. Coupled with surround sound, the experience can be overwhelming (indeed, some 3D movie watchers have been sick, so choose films wisely) but certainly memorable. A restored landmark like the 1914 Union Station wouldn't be complete without a proper theater as well as movie screens. The H&R Block City Stage Theater hosts live performances of everything from one man shows to multi-act circuses. Most shows play for only a few months, so the turnover is there if variety is a top priority. Pricing and show times for the Union Station Theater District gets a little tricky. This is due to Union Station's bundling/exclusion policies. Science City and the KC Rail Experience tickets are bundled in with Extreme Screen Tickets, and several who have bought $20+ tickets had only wanted to see one thing. It is possible to get JUST a movie ticket; don't be fooled. Traveling and very popular shows, on the other hand, are excluded from package deals, so those bought and all-inclusive were steamed when hit with a supplemental charge. Read tickets and advertisements closely to be sure what was purchased is exactly what is desired. With the Crown Center restaurants and shops nearby, many like to bundle an evening, though. Heading for an early dinner and a late show is a very popular date in Kansas City, so buy early for tickets on romantic or major holidays."

"Westport Neighborhood in Kansas City-Kansas City MO-Westport Entertainme nt District","Missouri","Westport Neighborhood in Kansas City-Kansas City MO-Westport Entertainme nt District","The Westport Neighborhood in Kansas City is one of the city's oldest neighborhoods. Originally its own town, known as Westport Landing, it was founded by Isaac McCoy and his family, who are considered to be the founders of Kansas City. Annexed into Kansas City proper in 1897, the area soon assumed its current position as a nightlife and entertainment district. As the oldest part of the city, the Westport Neighborhood is full of stories. Many involve Kelly's, a popular Irish Pub now but formerly many other things. It was a stable, a warehouse, grocers, a possible stop on the Underground Railroad and final a series of bars. The current iteration is also a popular stop on the trail . . . the St. Patrick's Day trail. Merry makers tend to descend on the Westport area during festival'' holidays. St. Patrick's Day, Mardi Gras, Oktoberfest, and any three day weekend mean big crowds. The many restaurants and music venues in the area along with the pubs save the scene from becoming totally debauched, but teetotalers should be forewarned before heading out for the weekend. TV fans, on the other hand, are probably armed for the weekend. The Westport Neighborhood served as the set for Malcolm & Eddie, a comedy starring Eddie Griffin and Malcolm Jamal-Warner. It ran for four seasons on UPN between 1996 - 2000 and locals will proudly point out key scene areas. Aside from TV culture and nightlife, the area also features several historical statues and commemorative plaques. With the waterfront close by, there are many historical happenings that almost accidentally fell into the neighborhood. Civil War skirmishes between travelling soldiers, goods smuggling, gambling, and bootlegging are just a few of the items noted throughout the neighborhood. It's a good place for visitors to come to get a sense of the old, real Kansas City life."
"White Water park in Branson - Branson MO Water Park Amusement Water Slide","Missouri","White Water park in Branson - Branson MO Water Park Amusement Water Slide","The summer in Missouri is undeniably hot and humid. While many venues at Branson respond by simply turning up the air conditioning, the White Water park in Branson takes a different approach. Instead of additional AC, White Water offers two million gallons of water to play in all day long. Part of the Silver Dollar City family fun complex, White Water is a 12 acres water park in the heart of the Branson strip. Rides are tailored to offer something for the whole family. This included offerings for the surly teenager in your life - if a 312 foot racing water slide can't get them into the spirit of vacation, you may want to drop them down one of the 300 foot free-fall slides when they aren't paying attention. However, the park isn't all about racing and heart stopper slides. The Little Squirts Waterworks has miniature waterfalls, shallow wading pools, and low level slides that kids will enjoy and parents will allow. Splash Island also offers wading and light swimming fun for younger kids. Surfers will also feel right at home. The heart of Missouri may not feel like it should be a surfing haven. However, White Water has constructed a 500,000 gallon surf pool for body surfing and tubing. Even experienced surfers have reported getting in good rides at the surf pool. Those who don't want to wade, surf, or slide will be interested in the rides. The Tropical Twister is a looping maze ride, while the Raging River Rapids simulate a white water experience. Do note that the Raging River Rapids has a 400 foot plunge. . . not for the faint hearted! The White Water park in Branson is open in the summers. The typical season runs May to September, with start days and final days decided by the prevailing temperatures. Season passes are available for water park addicts. Trained lifeguards make up the staff and rescue personnel are always on duty in case of mishap or over enthusiasm in the water."
"Wonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium","Missouri","Wonders of Wildlife Museum & Aquarium - Springfield, Missouri - public aquarium, museum, and tourist attraction","Opened in 2001, the Wonders of Wildlife Museum and Aquarium in Springfield, Missouri is also known as the American National Fish and Wildlife Museum and the Wonders of Wildlife Zooquarium. The exhibits feature more than 225 species of live animals, both land and water-based displayed in aquariums, interactive displays and educational programs. The building encompasses over 92,000 square feet devoted to fish and wildlife. The original idea and driving force behind the Wonders of Wildlife Museum and Aquarium is John Morris, founder of the Bass Pro Shops. Mr. Morris envisioned the museum and campaigned for its creation. His efforts resulted in a ballot initiative that raised $52,000,000.00 toward the building of the museum. In addition to the ballot initiative, the Wildlife Museum and Aquarium also received federal appropriations and is the recipient of a special sales tax district that allows Bass Pro shops and a small shoe shop across from the Bass Pro shops to collect taxes specifically to fund the Museum. The museum, located on the property of the original Bass Pro Shop is part museum, part zoo and part educational center'', according to a company spokesperson. The museum opened in November, 2001 and closed for renovations in 2007. Wonders of Wildlife was conceived as a mix of about 80% live and 20% museum exhibits. The intent of the museum was to showcase the role of hunting and fishing in conservation efforts. To that end, it featured numerous wild animal exhibits, including a 140,000 gallon aquarium that recreates the habitat of Table Rock Lake. The zoo's live exhibits include 40 different birds and mammal species and 120 different fish and reptile species. Other spectacles at the Wonders of Wildlife include a bat cave with 100 species of bats living behind glass walls in a walk-through exhibit, and the Out to Sea saltwater aquarium, which housed sharks, rays, eels and other ocean fish. A planned future exhibit included poisonous snakes and alligators. In addition to the live exhibits, the Wonders of Wildlife featured a number of educational museum displays aimed at families and children. The rivers exhibit, for example, lets kids float a little sponge fish down the current and follow its progress as they learn about conservation and the river environment. An open-air aviary is also part of the future plans for the Wonders of Wildlife museum and center. Wonders of Wildlife also featured the Community Pond, an 850 square foot gallery with views of the Missouri River habitat from the side and from underneath the water. The facility also provided unique event space for meetings and conferences, as well as educational outreach programs for area schools and residents. Currently, the museum is closed for all of the renovation to take place, but visitors can stop by their website to find out more about their plans and when they'll be open again."
"World's Largest Toy Museum","Missouri","World's Largest Toy Museum","Monday through Saturday, 9 am to 7 pm year-round, the World's Largest Toy Museum is open to the public. Located on the Branson strip and easily spotted by the full-size toy cars parked in the parking lot facing the street, the toy museum has something to offer nostalgic adults and wide-eyed children all at the same time. The toy museum has been operating in Branson for many years. The toys date from the 1800s to the present day and come in all shapes and sizes. Exhibits are sorted according to both period and style. Domestic and international toys are displayed side by side. Docents and staff are on hand to answer any questions and provide guidance. Many visitors have commented that working at the museum seems to be a way of life rather than a job for these people. While it might not seem like a fun experience - looking at toys rather than playing with toys - reviews of the museum indicate that kids love it. Part of the attraction is the way the exhibits are arranged to continue to capture the joy of playing with the toy and the love of toys that brought the pieces to Branson. The staff also has an excellent reputation for interacting with the public, providing information, and leading display sessions that are both fun and informative. For adults, the nostalgia factor is big. The massive action figure exhibit and toy tractor and truck displays will have many children of the 70's and 80's longing for their youth. Rare toys from around the world will also leave many impressed with the breadth of the collection. Additionally, a visit to the museum can provide a welcome bit of intellectual stimulation for parents who have been pummeled senseless by water slides, amusement parks, and other kid-focused attractions. Admission is under $20, with discounts for children. Due to the size of the museum, it is possible to spend a whole day looking at the exhibits. While tours are available, visitors are welcome to peruse the museum at their own pace without a guide as well. A gift shop on the premises offers souvenirs of the toy museum as well as toy replicas if you've seen something you just have to take home."
"Worlds of Fun","Missouri","Worlds of Fun - Kansas City, Missouri - Family Theme and Amusement Park","Worlds of Fun is a family theme and amusement park located in Kansas City, Missouri. It features over 100 different rides and attractions all based on themes, storylines, and characters from Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days. Worlds of Fun has been open and operational since its founding in 1971 and along with its adjoining sister park, Oceans of Fun, the Worlds of Fun park facility covers over 235 acres and holds the title of number one tourist attraction in the Kansas City area. It is currently owned and run by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. The biggest draw to Worlds of Fun is, of course, the wide selection of exciting rides and attractions. These encompass many different intensity levels and are categorized accordingly so that potential riders know in advance what to expect. The rides with the highest intensity level are the thrill rides. These are appropriate for adult and teen riders and include the majority of the park's roller coasters, drop rides, and similar attractions. Highly popular rides in this category include the Mamba, which at 205 feet tall is one of the tallest and longest coasters ever constructed; the Monsoon, an exciting multi-passenger water flume adventure; the Timber Wolf, the park's featured classic wooden coaster; and the Detonator, an exhilarating 200-foot tall drop tower attraction. The family rides category consists of attractions that are of mild to medium intensity level and are designed to appeal to all riders, including children and families.

These include the Autobahn, a classic bumper car arena experience; Le Carrousel, a beautiful old-fashioned carousel complete with all the trimmings; the Skyliner, the park's incredible 60-foot ferris wheel; and the Worlds of Fun Railroad, a fully-functional replica of a turn-of-the-century railroad.

Many of these are miniature or ultra-mild versions of some of the bigger rides found in the rest of the park. In addition to the rides, Worlds of Fun also offers access to complimentary family entertainment at various locations throughout the park. Although which shows are running during an average season tends to vary, many revolve around music and dance. There are also often shows available that revolve around animals, comedy or magic. In addition, kids can meet and greet their favorite characters from the popular Peanuts franchise including Snoopy, Charlie Brown, and Lucy when they visit Worlds of Fun's special Camp Snoopy area.
