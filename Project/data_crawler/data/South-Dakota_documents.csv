Bear Country USA is a reserve for animals such as the grizzly, elk, reindeer, bobcats, and cougars. It is possible to see the bears and other animals play in pools, climb trees, or move across the road while vehicles pass.

Bear cubs, otters, and other animals are in the walking area of the park. The otters have waterfalls and places to relax out of the water. Dr. Dennis Casey and his wife opened the park in 1972. At the time they had 11 black bear, one cougar, one wolf, three buffalo, and one large bull elk. In over 26 years they have gathered more animals including 200 black bear. In the 70's there was no zoo near Rapid City, which is one reason the Casey's decided to open their park. The park is about conservation of animals and land. When visitors arrive they will be greeted by Elk first. The road course takes them to the reindeer, past wolves, big horn sheep, and Dall sheep. After the sheep the park road leads to the Rocky Mountain Goat, before reaching the North American Black Bear. Cougars, Timber Wolves, and Buffalo are next on the drive before reaching the grizzly bears. The tour ends at Babyland. Bear Country USA is open during May to November from 8am to 6pm daily.

"Bramble Park Zoo in Watertown, South Dakota","South-Dakota","Bramble Park Zoo in Watertown, South Dakota","Bramble Park Zoo was opened in 1912, when the Watertown, South Dakota City Council accepted and exhibited a collection of pheasants and waterfowl donated by Frank Bramble. In 1940, the collection outgrew its original home and was then moved to its current location. The Works Progress Administration constructed new exhibit areas which formed the nucleus of Bramble Park Zoo. Over the years, the collection of animals expanded to include native species, as well as more exotic species like primates and hoofed animals. Between the years 1972-1976, the zoo experienced major renovations and further growth, both internally and externally. Through donations and community volunteer work, numerous exhibits and support buildings were constructed, as well as improvements being made to the outlying landscape and view areas. These improvements led to the zoo receiving accreditation by the Association for Zoos and Aquariums in 1993. The Bramble Park Zoo has continued to make further advancements, hired a professional staff, developed educational programs and participates in conservation and the Species Survival Program. The most poignant improvement made to the zoo has been the addition of a Discovery Center, constructed in 1998. Today, the Bramble Park Zoo welcomes more than 50,000 visitors annually, and is home to more than 500 animals which represent 130 species. The zoo is owned and operated by the City of Watertown and consists of 15-acres devoted to animal preservation and visitor education.

"Jewel Cave National Monument South Dakota","South-Dakota","Jewel Cave National Monument South Dakota","Jewel Cave National Monument occupies more than a million acres of land and is currently the second longest cave in the entire world. The first largest cave is located in Kentucky and is named the Mammoth Cave. The cave consists of 141 miles of various passageways that make it one of the most interesting and largest monuments in United States. The monument was named Jewel Cave because of all the beautiful calcite crystals that sparkled throughout the cave. Jewel Cave National Monument is located in South Dakota, east of the Wyoming border and is considered on of the best caves in the world. It is a fascinating natural attraction that has drawn millions to its opening since it was first discovered over a century ago. The cave was discovered by two brothers, Frank and Albert Michaud in 1900. The small opening of the cave was not large enough for a human to enter so the Michaud brothers used dynamite to blow open the entrance and then opened the caves as a business venture to tourists. Once news of the cave reached the president, it was proclaimed a National Monument and eventually taken over by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the National Park Service. Tourists have made their way to explore the monument since 1939. The National Park Service offers three tours of the cave, each providing a distinctive experience for participants. The historic tour is done with candlelight and takes place in the first discovered piece of the cavern, the Scenic Tour loops through a central portion of the cave and the final tour is called the Spelunking. For the Spelunking tour, explorers get the chance to journey through an undeveloped part of the cave. Each year, over a hundred thousand people attend the monument that has become a place of interest to both explorers and researchers. The cave is large and intricate with new discoveries that are consistently being made. The area of the cave is extensive and some explorers will camp inside the cave for days at a time in an effort to discover a new passageway that hasn't been detected. One couple, Herb and Jan Conn were made famous for their discoveries in Jewel Cave National Monument. The couple was able to map more than 64 miles of additional hidden passageways and had the honor of naming the new caverns they discovered. Explorers use techniques like clinometers and compasses during the Jewel Cave expeditions. Scientists believe that Jewel Cave National Monument was created over sixty million years ago by the dissolution of limestone and acid-rich water. The acid-water enlarged cracks under the ground that eventually formed the cave walls and rooms. The cave is composed of thousands of unique formations including needles, columns, stalactites, and flowstone. Most visitors first notice the calcite crystals that are almost everywhere through out the cave. In the year 2000, a forest fire that ravaged 83,000 acres burned down almost all of the monument and the area surrounding it. Fortunately, the historic buildings and Visitors Center were unharmed during the destruction."

Wild Bill Hickok was born on May 27, 1837 in Homer, Illinois (now known as Troy Grove, Illinois). He was known for his colorful personality, skills as a gunfighter, a scout and lawman. He fought for the Union Army during the Civil War and later gained notoriety as an expert marksman and professional gambler. Martha Jane Cannary, Calamity Jane'', was born May 1, 1852, and she was a professional scout for the US Army and a frontierswoman. She is best known for her close friendship with Wild Bill Hickok, in her biography, she even claimed the two had married and had a child together. Though this was never proven to be accurate. Hickok was known for being an expert gunslinger and marksman. He wore his favorite guns, two cap and ball Colt 1851 .36 Navy Model, until his death. The guns were silver plated and engraved with his initials, he wore them at the hip and backwards. He never used a gun holster and wore a red sash when wearing buckskin clothing and in a belt when wearing his city'' clothing, he drew the guns in a reverse draw. On August 6th, 1876, Hickok was playing poker at Saloon 10, in Deadwood, North Dakota. There were no empty places to sit, and Hickok regularly sat in corner seats so that he could avoid being ambushed from the back by rivals. During this game however, Hickok gave way to superstition and took a seat, with his back to the door while facing another door. This proved to be a fatal error, because Hickok was shot to death in the back of the head by Jack McCall. Charlie Utter claimed Hickok's' body and placed a funeral notice in the local paper, the Black Hills Pioneer. Almost the entire town of Deadwood attended his funeral, Hickok was buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery. Upon her death and according to her wishes, Calamity Jane was buried next to Wild Bill Hickok, their grave site continues to draw visitors to this very day."
"Shrine to Music Museum","South-Dakota","Shrine to Music Museum, University of South Dakota, SD","The Shrine to Music Museum may also be known as the National Music Museum and it is located at the University of South Dakota, 414 East Clark Street, Vermillion, South Dakota, 57069. The museum was founded in 1973 on the campus of the University and the collection has more than 14,500 instruments from America, Europe and non-Western cultures. The instruments span many historical periods throughout history. Every year there are thousands of visitors to the museum to see the collection. Some of the highlights of the collection include: two 18th century grand pianos with the specific type of action that the inventor of the piano, Bartolomeo Cristofori conceived. The first piano was built by Manuel Antunes of Lisbon in 1767 and it was signed and dated by him. The second piano was built in 1781 by Louis Bas in Villeneuve les Avignon and is the earliest extant French grand piano. There are 500 instruments made by an America company, C.G. Conn, in the later 19th and early 20th century which makes this collection a great resource for historical research. The brass, woodwinds and stringed instruments crafted in Nurnberg in the 17th and 18th century by members of the Hass and Oberlender families, Ernst Busch, Paul Hainlein and Jacob Denner are one of the most unique outside the country of Germany. Dutch woodwind instruments have found a place in the museum as have the Italian stringed instruments crafted by Andrea Guarneri, Antonio Stradivari and three generations of the Amati family and are better than the ones found in Italy. There are two of only three 17th century Cremonese stringed instruments in preserved, unaltered condition made by Andrea Guarneri in 1664. The archives hold violin making tools and Baroque fittings, fortepiano and harpsichord tuning hammers, and 1,000 brass mouthpieces from just about every turn of the century manufacturer. The museum is in a building that encompasses approximately 20,000 square feet, with nine galleries to display the instruments. The Arne B. Larson Concert Hall has wonderful acoustics and is the setting for performing and recording music played on original instruments. A specialized library, study-storage areas and a lab where instruments are restored is also part of the museum. The museum is also a place to hold seminars, conventions and lectures. A Gift Shop has books, CD's, DVD's, videos, posters, post cards, technical drawings, used books or periodicals, and note cards. Visitors can order by mail, fax or phone, Monday through Friday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm central time. They can pay using PayPal, Visa, MasterCard and Discover credit cards.

"South Dakota Town Assumes Bragging Rights as Geographic Center of the United States","South-Dakota","South Dakota Town Assumes Bragging Rights as Geographic Center of the United States","During much of the twentieth century, as the United States continued to grow, surveyors who were determined to plot the location of the center of the nation had to keep altering their decision, accommodating the addition of new states whenever necessary. When Hawaii became the 50th and last state to join the Union in 1959, the National Geodetic Survey at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration took up the task once again and determined the location of the geographic center of the United States to be a point in the middle of the South Dakota prairie in the county of Butte along old Highway 85. The decision was reached using a technique known as the center of gravity method'' which is akin to making a cardboard map of the country, all one thickness, and attempting to balance it atop some sort of narrow post. The geographic center would be the point at which the map would balance. (Before Alaska and Hawaii were added, the center of the U.S. was determined to be Lebanon, Kansas. With the addition of Alaska, the center moved to Castle Rock, Butte County, not far from the current location.) Practically inaccessible now that Highway 85 has been moved, the center of the U.S. is designated by a small marker, a flag, and a hand-written sign declaring the site's importance. Some visitors make the trek off the main highway to this - the real'' center - determined to take photos near the exact location. Others, however, now flock to the nearest town, Belle Fourche, SD, located about 20 miles from the official site, where guests are content to note that they were close to the geographic center of the U.S. The town of Belle Fourche, a small agricultural enclave, has always been the closest town to the official geographic center and has long hoped to benefit from the designation, which local officials believed would attract tourists to the town. Even though that failed to happen, especially after the highway was moved, Belle Fourche decided in 2007 to erect a new and larger monument touting the designation - one that has succeeded in attracting scores more visitors who now arrive to take pictures of their loved ones near the marker. The Belle Fourche Chamber of Commerce chose a 21-foot diameter structure fashioned from about 27 tons of South Dakota granite for the monument. On the marker in the center is a large map of the United States enclosed in a compass rose with all lines radiating from Belle Fourche. Visitors often stand in their home state while snapping photographs, marking their visit to someplace not so far from the Geographic Center of the United States."
"The Berlin Wall in South Dakota","South-Dakota","The Berlin Wall in South Dakota","Once Built to Divide, Now Unites  South Dakota is home to the Black Hills, numerous Indian Casinos, Mount Rushmore, the largest tyrannosaurus fossil ever found, and the lowest income taxes in the country. It is also the new home for a piece of the famed Berlin Wall. Memorial Park in Rapid City, South Dakota is now the permanent home to a section of the Berlin Wall which is now on display. The Berlin Wall was the defining image of an entire generation. It symbolized the separation of a free West Germany and a communist controlled East Germany. The wall separated light from dark, hope from fear, and freedom from oppression. It now resides practically in the shadow of one of America's most enduring national monuments, Mt. Rushmore. The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology rented an exhibit called, Break Through: Fight for Freedom at the Berlin Wall'' in October of 1996. The exhibit was drew a large audience and people began to unite in order to purchase two large pieces of the Berlin Wall for SD. Two large slabs of the wall were obtained and the difference between the graffiti laden side that faced West Germany and the drab industrial side that faced East Germany could not have been more apparent. Two tank traps, which look like three foot high iron X's were placed in front of the wall sections to symbolize the cold war which the Berlin Wall had come to represent. The exhibit is a favorite of locals and tourists alike. In fact, after spending time at the exhibit, many tourists may be moved to make the transition to that of full time resident. South Dakota is home to nearly 760,000 full time residents. The per capita personal income is slightly above $27,000 dollars per year. Residents earn this income primarily working in retail, finance, healthcare, the tourism industry, and agriculture. Purchasing a home in South Dakota will cost about $147,000 dollars according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This makes home ownership very possible for the residents of South Dakota. According to the Heritage Foundation South Dakota's public schools ranked tenth in the nation in the ALEC national achievement rating, this rates the overall performance of a state's school system. The Berlin Wall in SD is a monument not only to the fact that communism was defeated in Germany, but to the dedication and hard work South Dakotans put into purchasing and relocating the sculpture to Memorial Park."
