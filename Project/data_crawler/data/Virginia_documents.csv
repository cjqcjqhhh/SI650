"Bassett Hall, Williamsburg, Virginia, a Look into the Past","Virginia","Bassett Hall, Williamsburg, Virginia, a Look into the Past","   Bassett Hall sits in Colonial Williamsburg on 585 acres of land.  The white farmhouse was built in the mid 18th century.  The house is full of history and has been home to some well-known guests during its lifetime. In 1753 a member of the House of Burgesses, Philip Johnson, began the work of building the home that would in future years be called Bassett Hall. The home was completed in 1766 and in 1800 it was purchased by a Virginia congressman named Burwell Bassett, who also happened to be the nephew of Martha Washington . One of the most interesting stories relating to Bassett Hall is that of a Union soldier who stayed as a guest in the decidedly Confederate household in the midst of the Civil War. It was right after the Battle of Williamsburg that Union soldier George Armstrong Custer stayed as a guest of Bassett . The home is a frame house and as such was very vulnerable to the effects of time. In addition to the normal wear from the elements, the home was badly damaged in a 1927 fire. At that time, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and his wife Abby Aldrich Rockefeller were in the middle of a project to restore Colonial Williamsburg . When they first took on the project, they did not know how time consuming and labor intensive it would be. The couple was very dedicated to the project and therefore insisted on being on site whenever there were major decisions to be made . Because of the amount of time they needed to spend in Williamsburg, they decided to purchase a home there.  They purchased Bassett Hall in the early 1930's and began to restore the home. Abby decorated the home with a large folk art collection that was later donated to Colonial Williamsburg and is now part of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum in Williamsburg. Bassett Hall became one of the favorite homes of the Rockefellers, and it remained in their family until 1979. At that time is was donated back to Colonial Williamsburg along with all of the homes furniture and much of the decor. The home is now open to the public as part of Colonial Williamsburg. A visitor from Florida wrote that Bassett Hall is off the main road and hidden from view...Most of the artifacts in the home are from the Rockefellers. The home is beautiful, with fantastic chandeliers and folk art'' . As confirmed by the visitor, the home today looks much as it did during the time that the Rockefellers called in home in the 1930's and 1940's. The restoration project, which began in the year 2000, took two years to complete. Today Bassett Hall stands as one of the most important historic buildings in Colonial Williamsburg."

The Palmer course was the first to open in 2001 and has been described as an almost sensual experience,'' especially when the azaleas are in bloom. Playing along stunning views and the natural terrain of the Eastern Shore, the course features wooden bridges that run through coastal growth, sparkling white-sand bunkers, shell cart paths, sand dunes, and historical landmarks from the early 19th and 20th centuries and the days of the railroads. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,204 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.2 and a slope rating of 142, one of the highest in the area. The course has been said to pamper'' golfers with perfectly manicured Tifway 419 Bermuda-grass fairways and smooth A-4 greens. Wind can be a significant factor on the course, however, often reaching formidable'' levels that will challenge players, especially on the front nine. When there's no wind, the back nine is considered the more difficult side. The front nine starts off with the bay on the right, then the layout turns inland and becomes more tree-studded. At Hole No. 8 it opens up again, but all the while golfers will feel like they're out in the ocean,'' with the smell of salt air always present. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 3, which plays as the #1-handicap hole on the course. This long par-4 requires a solid drive off the tee, since the second shot requires a potentially long carry over water to the green. According to some visitors to the course, Hole No. 3 will take your breath away.'' The finishing hole at Bay Creek Palmer Course has been described as a great closing hole. A par-5, the hole plays to 543 yards from the longest tees and features water that runs across the fairway. It's been said that golfers should save their strength for this hole,'' which requires a long carry over water and features a green guarded by rocks. Since its opening, the Palmer Course has garnered a number of awards, including being named a Top 10 Best New Upscale Course by Golf Digest in 2003. Practice facilities at Bay Creek are state-of-the-art and include a full practice range with five target greens, as well as a chipping and putting green.

"Berkeley Plantation, Charles City, Virginia, History Along the James River","Virginia","Berkeley Plantation, Charles City, Virginia, History Along the James River","  Berkeley Plantation, located in Charles City, Virginia, is rich with American history. The main home was built in 1726 by Benjamin Harrison on what was originally 8,000 acres along the James River. It was here that the ninth United States President, William Henry Harrison was born. Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Harrison V was born here as well. Other important historical events took place at Berkeley Plantation as well. In 1619 a group of settlers from England landed on the grounds. They celebrated by giving thanks to God for their safe journey. Many consider this to be the very first Thanksgiving. In 1862 Taps'' was written on the plantation grounds while it was occupied by McClellan's Union Army. George Washington and nine other presidents visited Berkeley Plantation including Abraham Lincoln who visited twice during the Civil War. It was at Berkeley Plantation that the first bourbon whiskey was distilled. And that is just a taste of the history that has taken place at Berkeley. After the war, the Harrison family was not able to get the plantation back and, over time, it fell into disrepair. In 1907, a man named John Jamieson purchased the plantation. Jamieson had been a drummer boy at Berkeley in 1862, the year that Taps was written. He began a restoration that his son continued and today Berkeley and the remaining 1,000 acres are open to the public. Berkeley Plantation is located 18 miles west of Williamsburg and is the oldest 3-story brick house in Virginia. Visitors can see the date stone that was placed by Benjamin Harrison in 1726. A costumed interpreter leads a tour of the home and the grounds and gardens can be explored at the visitor's leisure. Some visitors were disappointed that the house tour included only rooms on the first floor. Members of the Jamieson family still live at Berkeley Plantation and the top two floors of the house serve as their residence. Other visitors found the gardens, which predate the Revolutionary War, to be the best part of their visit. The home is furnished in 18th century antiques and the basement houses miniatures of outbuildings that once existed on the property. There are also several Civil War artifacts on display in the basement where guests can also watch a short film about the history of the Berkeley Plantation. During the holiday season, the plantation house is decked out as it may have been during Christmas long ago. The grounds, situated along the James River, are a popular spot for weddings and Berkeley Plantation is available for such private functions. Because special events are held at Berkeley quite often, it is a good idea to call ahead to be sure the plantation house and grounds will be open to the public on a particular date."

"Booker T. Washington National Monument in Virginia is an Important Black History Site","Virginia","Booker T. Washington National Monument in Virginia is an Important Black History Site","	Located 25 miles southeast of Roanoke in Franklin County, Virginia, the Booker T. Washington National Monument was established in 1956 in order to preserve portions of the farm on which the former slave and educator grew up. The 207-acre James Burroughs tobacco farm near the community of Hardy is where Washington was born into slavery 100 years before the site became a nationally-designated monument. Washington's mother served as a cook for the Burroughs family, who had relocated to this farm from one in the southwestern portion of the state. According to the National Park Service, which maintains the monument, approximately 20,000 visitors enter this park each year to learn more about Booker T. Washington, who eventually went on to establish The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School, later known as the Tuskegee Institute and now Tuskegee University. A tour of the site generally begins with a stop at the Visitor Center, where guests can view an audio-visual presentation profiling the life of this influential African American. Park rangers and volunteers are also located at the center to answer questions about Washington or to guide visitors to other park attractions. Also located in the Visitor Center is a book store/gift shop that includes a large selection of books and other items pertaining to Booker T. Washington and to African American history in general. Visitors may choose to travel the Plantation Trail, a short .25-mile interpretive walk that winds through this historic area. Reconstructions of the 19th century buildings that occupied the Burroughs Farm while Washington lived here are open for exploration. An informative park brochure provides information on each of the buildings. For a longer walk, visitors can hike along the Jack-O-Lantern Branch Trail, a 1.5-mile walk that allows guests to explore the natural side of the farm as it winds through the fields and forests surrounding the monument. Printed guides that offer information about the trail can be picked up at the Visitor Center. The Garden Area of the farm lets visitors explore techniques used by farmers and their slaves during the 19th century. The garden grows items that were typical of what would have been found on a farm in the piedmont region of Virginia during that era. The Booker T. Washington National Monument and its accompanying reproduction farm is also home to a number of farm animals including pigs, horses, sheep, and chickens. Rangers educate visitors as to what breeds of animals would have typically been found on a 19th century Virginia farm and how the animals were used for both work and leisure. Guests can tour the entire Booker T. Washington National Monument on their own or may take advantage of occasional ranger-led tours. Tour schedules change according to the time of year and reservations are not required unless traveling with a large group. Rest rooms are provided in the Visitor Center and a picnic area is also available for public use."

"Canal Walk, Richmond, Virginia, A Stroll Through History","Virginia","Canal Walk, Richmond, Virginia, A Stroll Through History"," It was in 1784 that work began on a canal system in downtown Richmond, Virginia. George Washington himself surveyed the digging of these canals. Heavily used in the early to mid 1800's, the canals were badly damaged in the Civil War. In 1998, the city of Richmond began an extensive restoration project and now the area is a spot where visitors can take a walk and learn a bit about Richmond history while enjoying the beautiful scenery. Some say there is not much to do along the Canal Walk, and that is true if one is looking for abundant shopping and a thriving night life. What the Canal Walk does offer, however, is a look at Richmond's history in a setting that was an important part of that history. Because the area that is now Canal Walk is steeped in history, it is only appropriate that historical elements are the highlight of the walk. Visitors can see a replica of the box that slave Henry Brown used to famously ship himself to freedom after his family was cruelly taken from him and sold to a North Carolina farmer. Visitors can also stop by the Richmond Civil War Visitor Center and learn a bit about the role that Richmond played in that war. The rich history is likely a big part of what makes Canal Walk a popular residential area. There are luxury, resort style apartments that are located on the James River. Canal Walk can be viewed from the water thanks to a ferry that runs on the James River, or they can walk through the area which allows as leisurely a visit as is desired. As visitors stroll through Canal Street they can stop to read about historical events which are posted on signs along the route. They can also stop for a moment to just sit and enjoy the beautiful scenery.

"Carlyle House, Alexandria, Virginia, A Mansion Full of History","Virginia","Carlyle House, Alexandria, Virginia, A Mansion Full of History"," In the middle of the 18th century, John Carlyle, a merchant from Scotland, wanted to build a spectacular home for his bride, Sarah Fairfax. The result of that effort, which was completed in 1753, still stands in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia and is known as Carlyle House. The home, which was built by the labor of both indentured servants and slaves, was the setting for much heartache for the Carlyle family. The day they moved into the house, Sarah gave birth to their first child. He would be the first of seven children, but only five survived past the toddler stage. Sarah died giving birth to her last child, a daughter named Ann. Set along the Potomac River, Carlyle House has the distinction of being the only home in Alexandria that is a stone, 18th century home in the Palladian style.  John and Sarah Carlyle enjoyed entertaining in their beautiful home. Sarah came from on the most prominent families of the day, and the family was connected to many prominent social and political people. Grand dinners and other social events were regular occurrences in their home. In 1755, Carlyle was forced to host a rather unwelcome group of guests. General Edward Braddock, who held the title Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's Forces in North America, had been sent to oversee the French and Indian War. When he arrived in Alexandria, along with 1200 troops, the general selected Carlyle house as his headquarters. He was in the home for three weeks during which time John Carlyle wrote these words to his brother, George, about the general. too fond of his passions, women and wine...'' He also said that general had abused his house and furnishings...'' Still, the fact that history was being made inside his home was not lost on him, despite the inconvenience that his house guests were causing. He also wrote this to George: their was the Grandest Congress held at my home ever known on the Continent.'' The meeting, held by General Braddock, included five colonial governors. John Carlyle died in 1780 at which time the house was passed on to his daughter Sarah. Sarah lived in the home with her own family, but by the time 1827 rolled around, the home was no longer in the hands of the Carlyle family. The house was bought and sold several times and served a variety of purposes, including serving as a Civil War hospital. Today, the home is operated by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority, which purchased it in 1970 and spent six years restoring the property before opening it to the public. Visitors can tour the home and see interpretations of daily life in Colonial America."

"Colonial Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia, A Look at Life in Colonial America","Virginia","Colonial Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia, A Look at Life in Colonial America"," A trip to Williamsburg, Virginia offers a diverse mix of things to do. Among the popular attractions is an amusement park, Busch Gardens, but close by is another world entirely. One of the most popular attractions in the area is Colonial Williamsburg where visitors can feel as though they have stepped back in time. Historic interpreters, costumed in period clothing, can answer visitors questions and show guests, first hand, what life was like in Colonial America. Visitors can chat with farmers, preachers, servants and businessmen - who never break character - while strolling the streets lined with period homes and the Bruton Parish Church, built in 1710, which is the oldest Episcopal church still in continuous use in America . Interestingly, people live in some of the period homes, but to maintain absolute adherence to what a colonial street would have looked like, no modern amenities may be seen from any public area. That means no electric lights or televisions can be visible from any street-facing windows and no telephone lines, cable wires or satellite dishes can be visible. It is this attention to even the smallest details that make a trip to Williamsburg memorable for many visitors. One visitor said, We had a fabulous time. This is a place to ask questions of the costumed citizens on the street and on the tours. Most of them remain in character and make the whole thing come alive, adding details that you may not have read about or seen in movies'' . While there are many attractions for which a ticket must be purchased, some visitors found that the essence of Colonial Williamsburg can be enjoyed without paying a dime. Writes one visitor, We just went there and took the advice to just go walk through Colonial Williamsburg and not buy tickets. This was the best advice, you really can enjoy the place by eating in the tavern and looking around the shops without paying for an entrance fee'' . Buying a ticket does, however, allow visitors to enter some of the period homes, a benefit not afforded to those who do not pay admission. Also, there are museums, including the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum and the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. Exhibits include object from everyday life in Colonial America such as weapons, furniture and toys. The lives of African Americans in Colonial Williamsburg are also represented. Half of the population was black and most of that number were slaves. While there was a small percentage of African Americans in Colonial Williamsburg that were free, a life of slavery was the reality for most. Special reenactments, such as of a slave auction, are held occasionally so that people will not lose sight of the terror and anguish experienced by those who were slaves . Colonial Williamsburg is rich with historical reenactments, artifacts, architecture and history and is a glimpse back to the origins of The United States."

"Edgar Allen Poe Museum, Richmond, Virginia, Remembering a Great American Writer","Virginia","Edgar Allen Poe Museum, Richmond, Virginia, Remembering a Great American Writer"," Edgar Allen Poe, one of America's most loved poets and authors, was born in Boston, but considered Richmond, Virginia to be his home. Born in 1809, three year old Edgar was traveling with his mother, an actress, when she died while in Richmond. He was taken in and raised in Richmond by the Allan family.  His sister, Rosalie, was taken and raised by another Richmond family. The Edgar Allen Poe Museum, which was opened in 1922, is located a few blocks away from where he lived and from the site of his first job in Richmond at the Southern Literary Messenger. It is also within a few blocks of the burial place of his mother, Eliza Poe. The museum is the oldest residential building in Richmond, with tree ring dating it to as far back as 1754. Around the time of the 100th anniversary of Poe's birth, a group of citizens in Richmond felt that the writer needed a better way to be remembered. The group originally had wanted a statue of Poe to be included on Monument Avenue. The city council declined the request, saying that Poe was of disreputable character.'' The group went on to found the museum. The Old Stone House was to be demolished, but was saved by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities.  Originally called the Edgar Allen Poe Shrine, these words were spoken at a ceremony for the opening of the museum. This day... at a first expense of about $20,000, completes the Edgar Allan Poe Shrine, and marks the seventy-second anniversary of the death of the poet. If he is aware of mundane affairs he must be pleased to find that, at length, there has been reared to his memory a lasting and appropriate memorial.'' Exhibits include a large collection of manuscripts, first edition books and personal letters written by Poe. There are also an impressive number of personal items relating to Poe. These include the bed he slept in as a boy, articles of his clothing, his walking stick, his chest, a small box that had been used by his wife, a lock of his hair, a portrait of his father and a daguerreotype of Poe. Another treasure of the museum is a handwritten autobiography''. Poe wrote the piece at the request from a publisher who wanted to include some personal information along with an article of Poe's they were publishing. The autobiography'' is full of the lies and exaggerations for which Poe would become infamous for during his short life and that would earn him the nickname The American Byron.'' There is also a portion of the museum dedicated to the many theories about how Poe might have died on October 7, 1849. There has been much speculation over the years, and ideas have included murder, epilepsy, carbon monoxide poisoning and a host of others.

Pets are welcome at both the campsites and the cabins for a small additional fee. One visitor from Pennsylvania said that she had a view of the bay from her campsite. She also enjoyed the fact that each campsite had a water hookup and electricity available. She was, however, disappointed that she was not able to reserve a certain campsite and wished that the whole process of checking in could have been more streamlined. Another visitor enjoyed the convenience of having a store in the park as well as the ability to rent bikes. She said her only complaint was how close the campsites were to each other. Another fact that many overnight park visitors enjoy is that while the park offers many outdoor activities and allows one to get close to nature, all of the amenities of Virginia Beach are a just a few miles away. One of the big events held at the park each year is Paddlefest, which features various paddle water sports. The event is held in September of each year. Another yearly event in which the park takes part is Clean the Bay Day where volunteers come together at several locations to clean trash and debris from beaches throughout the area. First Landing State Park is Virginia's most visited park and there are several programs, both guided and self-guided available. These include crabbing, junior rangers and beach walks.

"Fort Monroe's Casemate Museum, Hampton, Virginia, History Rich Exhibits Inside America's Largest Stone Fort","Virginia","Fort Monroe's Casemate Museum, Hampton, Virginia, History Rich Exhibits Inside America's Largest Stone Fort","  Located inside of the city of Hampton, Virginia, about 40 miles from Virginia Beach, is the site of one of the oldest forts in the country. Fort Monroe is what stands there now, but three other forts came before it. The first of those, Fort Algernourne, was built in 1609. That fort only stood for a short three years before burning down in 1612.  Old Point Comfort was built in 1632 followed by Fort George in 1749. Hurricanes wreaked havoc on both of those forts, both of which were partially destroyed. Fort Monroe, which is the largest stone fort in the country, was built in the early 1800's with the mission of protecting America from attacks from the sea. Dozens of canons lines the perimeter of the fort, ready to destroy any ship that threatened the safety of the shorelines. The Casemate Museum first opened on Fort Monroe, which is still an active army base, in 1951. Originally, the sole mission of the museum was to allow visitors to view the cell in which Confederate President Jefferson Davis had been kept during the Civil War. Since that time, however, many other items and exhibits have been added to the museum. Artifacts displayed in the Casemate Museum include 19th century uniforms, weapons, news clippings, medical instruments, and artistic renderings. There are also displays highlighting how some of the rooms have been used in the past. Another popular exhibit highlights politician Benjamin Butler's decision regarding slaves who had come within his lines during the Civil War. Butler, who at the time was brigadier general of the militia, allowed the slaves to stay at the fort and refused to return them to their owners. He did this in spite of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, a law in force at the time that required the return of slaves. Butler found a loophole to the law by stating that the slaves were contraband of war and, for that reason, need not be returned. This allowed him to grant the slaves as much freedom as they could have at that time in the nation's history. One visitor from Indiana liked the fact that she had to cross a moat in order to get the museum. She said that when she entered the museum, she felt like she was stepping back in time. She said, You can actually see and feel what it was like to live inside a fort.'' Fort Monroe is still an active army base. For this reason, a valid photo identification must be presented in order to enter Fort Monroe and visit the museum. Historic Fort Monroe is slated for closure by September of the year 2011. The fate of the Casemate Museum remains uncertain."

"George Washington Birthplace National Monument Virginia","Virginia","George Washington Birthplace National Monument Virginia","George Washington's birthplace is in Westmoreland County, Virginia and is now home to a national monument. The grounds were originally settled by George Washington's great-grandfather who kept the property in the family passing it down for generations. His great-grandfather settled on the plantation back in 1657 and eventually purchased the additional land located near the Pope's Creek. George Washington was born on the grounds February 1732, lived there until he was three years of age and then returned as a teen. The home where he was actually born was built in 1718, and renovated during the early to mid 1720's. The first thing visitors will notice when entering the grounds is the memorial shaft obelisk that is made of Vermont marble.  The obelisk is a tenth of the size of the original in Washington, D.C. The park grounds are extensive and includes acres of lush gardens, livestock, crops of wheat and tobacco, groves of beautiful trees, and farm buildings. The park has maintained its integrity over the years and accurately symbolizes the environment that George Washington grew up in as a toddler and teenager. In 1858, the state of Virginia acquired the property to preserve the birthplace of George Washington but the Civil War destroyed the state's plans to retain the house and the homesite fell into the hands of the United States Federal Government in 1882. During the following years, George Washington's birthplace sat in idleness with no major plans for any renovations. In 1923, the Wakefield National Memorial Association was formed to restore the property to its original integrity and provide upkeep to further preserve the history of the home. Each year, over a hundred thousand people head to the historical home to visit the place where George Washington was born. In the 1930's, a Memorial House was opened to mark the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth. The construction of the memorial house is a close replica of his original birthplace, but represents more of a typical upper class house of that period. The Memorial House is constructed of bricks that were made by hand, has four rooms on each floor and a central hallway. Antique furnishings from the 1700's makes visitors to the home feel as if they have stepped back in time. The memorial house has precious artifacts that are more than 200 years old. It wasn't until 1930 that the United States authorized George Washington's Birthplace as a national monument. The home site covers over 550 acres of land. Part of the land contains a burial ground, that contains the graves of 32 members of George Washington's family. His great-grandfather, grandfather, and father are all buried in the cemetery. In addition to the burial ground and Memorial House, other facilities are open to visitors who tour the monument such as the birthplace home area, hiking trails, picnic grounds, and the Kitchen House. In the Kitchen House re-enactors in costumes demonstrate soap and candle making, which were two household duties common during that time. A Visitors Center contains additional information on the history of the homesite as well as the life of George Washington. Artifacts recovered from a burned property and a fifteen minute film depicting what life was like for the Washington Family are shown in the exhibit and theater areas of the Visitors Center. The George Washington Birthplace is currently operated by the National Park Service."
"Golden Horseshoe Golf Club, Gold Course, Williamsburg, Virginia - a Classic American Golf Course Updated for Resort Play","Virginia","Golden Horseshoe Golf Club, Gold Course, Williamsburg, Virginia - a Classic American Golf Course Updated for Resort Play","When the Gold Course opened at the Colonial Williamsburg resort in 1963, the original course architect, Robert Trent Jones, called it his finest design.'' And, over the years, the course received much acclaim in terms of its beauty, playability and quality of design. In the mid-1990s, however, it was decided that the Gold Course, which had also gained a reputation as being a difficult layout, be altered to make it more friendly for the average resort player. Rees Jones was brought in for the project, which included a lot of fairway grading, which typically wasn't done in course construction thirty years earlier. The holes were graded to flow in the direction of play, helping with playability. Other changes included creating greater visibility for the greens, and adding some championship hole locations for tournament play. The younger Jones also eliminated some of the fall-off'' characteristics of the greens, since they were already pretty small, while adding contours on some and flattening others. Bunkers were also deepened, a new state-of-the-art irrigation system was installed, and the cart paths were paved around the entire layout. After the renovations, the 18-hole, par-71 course re-opened in 1998 and now plays to 6,817 yards from the longest tees, with a slope rating of 144. Even with the improvements aimed at making the course more player friendly, it's still one of the more difficult challenges in the Mid-Atlantic region. As Glen Byrnes, Director of Golf at the Golden Horseshoe Golf Club described it: It's target golf in a beautiful setting. There's a very small area on every hole that you're aiming at off the tee, so it plays a lot more difficult than it appears - because it looks so open. The greens are small and undulated, so scoring is easier said than done out there. The Gold Course is more than just a set of golf holes. The visual beauty that you experience on the golf course throughout the day, coupled with the incredibly well-designed flow of the layout - which offers you holes of every length and shape... you'll use every club in your bag. Whether you have your best or worst hole, you'll still enjoy the opportunity to play it.'' Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include its collection of par-3 holes, including the star of the show, No. 16. One of the first island greens ever built, the hole plays to 169 yards and steeply downhill to a large island green that appears to have been placed in the valley of a tree-filled park. According to most reviewers, it's the one hole players will have etched in their memories long after leaving the Gold Course. Since its redesign, the Gold Course has received other accolades, including being named among America's 100 Greatest Public Course by Golf Digest in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009. Golfweek magazine ranked it among the Top 100 Resort Courses in 2007, while GOLF Magazine listed the course among the Top 100 You Can Play six times."

"Gravelly Point Park, Arlington, Virginia, One of the Best Places in the Country to Watch Planes Landing","Virginia","Gravelly Point Park, Arlington, Virginia, One of the Best Places in the Country to Watch Planes Landing","  When looking for a perfect spot for a date, a place where planes continually pass overhead, making conversation difficult and shaking the earth as they pass might not be exactly what one pictures. But Gravelly Point, a park located in Arlington, Virginia is a popular date spot AND one of the best places in the country to watch planes landing and taking off. Some visitors, when told about the park, thought it wasn't there cup of tea. One woman said she never would have, on her own, visited a place where the highlight was a plane flying overhead. But she met a blind date there and said that her eyes were opened to how truly thrilling it is. The thrill comes from the fact that the planes fly as low as 100 to 150 feet directly overhead. The park, which was created by adding loads of topsoil on top of a landfill, is located slightly north of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The runway for that airport is just 400 feet away from the park. During the busy time of day, a visitor might see 30 planes coming or going within an hour. Even during slower periods, there is normally some activity every 8 minutes or so. Adding to the fun of watching these planes is the fact that the planes must make sharp turns in order to avoid flying over restricted airspace, such as the space over the White House. Watching a huge jet seem to almost turn on its side and fly directly overhead is something that visitors to this park return to see again and again. There is ample parking at Gravelly Point, which is a good thing since the park always has a crowd. In addition to plane watching, visitors may bring a picnic, toss a Frisbee or lie on the grass and read a book. Located on the George Washington National Parkway on the bank of the Potomac River, the Northern Virginia Bike Path runs right through the park. That makes Gravelly Point a popular starting point for those who wish to take a run or a bike ride. One Arlington local said she just parks her car at Gravelly Point, pulls her bike out of the back and hits the trail. When she's done, if the weather is nice, she'll relax beneath one of the willow trees and watch a few planes come and go or read a book. The noise is deafening, but that doesn't seem to deter either the aviation lovers or those who come to more casually the airplane traffic. There is also a great view of the Washington skyline, and leashed dogs are permitted in the park."

A large majority of the sites and attractions are history related, but not all of them. The Haunted Dinner Theater is one popular attraction that can give you a break from the walking involved in most of Williamsburg's attractions. The Haunted Dinner Theater, located at 5363 Richmond Road, Route 60 in Williamsburg provides visitors a fun night out that is appropriate for the entire family. Upon hearing the word haunted'', one visitor from Pennsylvania was unsure that it would be a good idea to bring his 10-year-old daughter, who is easily spooked. He called ahead and learned that there is nothing scary about the show, and that it is more of a fun, mystery, whodunit, type of show. He said, They were right. I brought my whole family, and everyone had a blast.'' The theater is located in the back part of Captain George's World Famous Restaurant. Their all you can eat seafood buffet is included in the price of the ticket. With over seventy items on the buffet, there is something for everyone. Some of the items include snow crab legs, prime rib, fried shrimp, seafood casserole, fried chicken, a dozen other entrees and too many side dishes and desserts to list. One visitor from Boston was also worried about bringing his kids, but for a different reason. He said they are pretty particular about what they will and will not eat. He said that while the show was ok, the acting wasn't very professional, but it was better than other murder mystery dinners I've been to,'' that the food was great. He said that not only was the buffet huge, but that there was plenty of food to choose from, even for the pickiest of eaters in his family. The show changes annually and some visitors go back year after year. Once visitors are seated, they are invited to go to the buffet. Then the mystery theater begins. As they eat their dinner, the actors drop clues as to whodunit'' so the participants can try to solve the mystery. After the first act, they are invited back to the buffet, and will have other opportunities to visit the buffet throughout the evening. There are special celebration packages available for anniversaries and birthdays. The Haunted Theater is located near much of the best shopping in Williamsburg and many weary shoppers have found that it is a nice way to end a day spent at the Pottery or the outlet malls.

"Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia, the Final Resting Place of Many Notable Americans","Virginia","Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia, the Final Resting Place of Many Notable Americans"," Many American cities have historic cemeteries that are popular with visitors. Richmond is no exception. The Hollywood Cemetery, located at 412 South Cherry Street, was designed in 1847 by John Notman of Philadelphia. It was designed to be a garden cemetery''. Notman wanted to get away from the grid-like design of other cemeteries and create a space that was more reminiscent of a park. Situated on the James River, the cemetery provides a beautiful view of the water from many spots. While the first plot in Hollywood Cemetery was not sold until 1849, many of those buried there were born in the early 1700's. These were originally buried in another location and then moved to the cemetery when urban expansion made such a move necessary. Visitors are encouraged to stop by the visitor center where they can find helpful brochures and maps of the cemetery. Because there are thousands of people buried in Hollywood Cemetery, it can be difficult to find the graves of the many notable and historic figures who are buried there. Among the important people interred there are two American presidents, John Monroe, the fifth president and John Tyler, the tenth. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States, is also buried there as is his son and daughter. There are also 25 confederate generals buried on the grounds. That is more than any other cemetery. Along with the confederate generals, there are 18,000 enlisted confederate soldiers buried nearby. The sacrifice of these men is commemorated with a 90-foot tall granite pyramid which was completed in 1869 to honor these men. While some might think a visit to a cemetery is morbid, many find it a rich experience full of historic meaning. One visitor said there was history at every turn.''  Another noted that the beauty of the grounds was as impressive as the history contained within the cemetery. Along with the graves of presidents and confederate soldiers are the graves that mark other events, some tragic, in history. There are graves of those who fought in World War and many graves of those who died during the flu epidemic in 1918. It was November of that year when 800 men, women and children died in Richmond during the epidemic. Among the graves is one for Jack Williams, a 15 year old boy who tended to the sick and refused to go home, even though he was exhausted. He continued to care for his friends until he, too, came down with the flu that took his life. Among other notables is William Burke. Burke was an Irish school teacher who had among his teenage students one Edgar Allen Poe, who would go on to be one of the most widely read writers in American history. Hollywood Cemetery is the final resting place of many notables where visitors can ponder history while strolling through the beautiful grounds."

"Jamestown Settlement, Jamestown, Virginia, The Birthplace of America","Virginia","Jamestown Settlement, Jamestown, Virginia, The Birthplace of America","  A visit to Jamestown actually consists to a visit to two separate - although closely located - spots. One is a recreation of the Jamestown settlement. The other is the site where the settlement was actually located. Both offer a look into the lives of those early settlers. While many give the New England pilgrims credit for being the first settlers, the Jamestown settlers arrived in 1607, 13 years before the good men and women landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The 1607 settlers made their homes on the bank of Virginia's James River and they called their colony Jamestowne. Jamestown Settlement The recreation of the original settlement includes replicas of the church and homes and has been duplicated right down to the smallest details of the settlers everyday lives. Small gardens brim with vegetables, straw stuffed mattresses and primitive dining tables and chairs are available for inspection. Questions can be answered by any of the costumed interpreters who roam about. Many skilled craftsmen, also dressed in period costumes, ply their trades in the exact manner that the Jamestown settlers would have done 400 years ago. In addition to the settlement, there is also a recreation of a Powhatan village. This recreation shows the way of the life of the native Americans that the Jamestown settlers would have encountered. The village includes reed covered houses, ceremonial articles, and even a dugout canoe. There are also plenty of costumed Native American interpreters available to answer your questions. Replicas of the three ships that brought the settlers from England, The Susan Constant, The Discovery and The Godspeed, are also on display. Visitors can tour the ships, lie in the bunks, sit in the mess hall and get a feel for how crowded each of the ships must have been on the long journey from England to Virginia . A museum features films about the settlers as well as artifacts discovered at the original settlement and important documents are artwork of the period. A visit to the Jamestown Settlement is very kid-friendly, with lots of hands on exhibits and interesting things to see and do. Some, people, however, are looking for a more authentic experience. One visitor from Florida said, If you are looking for real buildings left by the settlers, Jamestown settlement is not your place. I am not sure why they call it Jamestown Settlement. They didn't even settle in this location. If you are looking for a museum or and educational experience, this is a great place. The museum has a lot of information and small artifacts. The settlement shows you how the settlers had lived. We were looking for left over buildings. For this, go to Historic Jamestowne just a little further down the road'' . Historic Jamestowne Historic Jamestowne is the site where the settlers actually landed. Visitors can see archeological digs and view the foundations of the original buildings as well as the tower from the original church. Visitors can also observe as glass blowers, wearing period costume, demonstrate their skills . The ruins of many buildings can be seen, and a stop at the museum where many artifacts found on site are on display will round out the visit. A stop at both locations is the best way to ensure that you get the full experience of life in Colonial America.

"King's Arm Tavern, Williamsburg, Virginia, A Taste of Colonial America","Virginia","King's Arm Tavern, Williamsburg, Virginia, A Taste of Colonial America"," On February 6, 1772, Mrs. Jane Vobe placed the following advertisement in the Virginia Gazette. I have just opened TAVERN opposite to the Raleigh at the sign of the KING's ARMS....and shall be much obliged to the Gentlemen who favour me with their company.'' Those who visit Colonial Williamsburg today can have a somewhat similar dining experience as the men who read that ad on that 18th century morning by stopping by the King's Arms Tavern, located at 416 Duke of Gloucester Street, during their trip to the city. While some of the menu items were inspired by colonial recipes, many of them have been modified somewhat. Still some of the names, such as Mrs. Vobe's Peanut Soup, Colonial Game Pye, which includes venison, rabbit and duck, and A Dish of Lamb come straight from the colonial tavern menu. The menu items have taken on a life of their own in a way and a quick internet search will yield the recipes for many of the food choices that are found at the King's Arms Tavern. The dycor was influenced by artifacts found on site and by items listed on an insurance policy for the tavern from the 1700's. The tableware and the furniture are reproductions of colonial pieces and the wait staff is made up of costumed interpreters who will share tidbits of life in the real colonial Williamsburg while guests enjoy their meals. Even the smallest details, such as pewter salt and pepper shakers, brass wall sconces and framed prints are included to give the tavern a look that is as close to what it would have been in 1772 as is possible. Many visitors said they found that the experience felt like they had stepped back in time. A woman who was visiting from California said that the King's Arm Tavern was extremely charming and fabulously authentic'' While most of the visitors seem to agree on that point, some found the menu items to be a bit overpriced, but added that they were paying not just for the food, but for the experience as well. There is a rumor about a ghost that resides at the tavern. Irma, so the story goes, was killed in a fire. This low-key apparition is not spotted very often, but many have attested to having seen her or felt her near. Another rumor says that the staff of the King's Arms Tavern always say goodnight to their guest Irma when they lock up for the night. The King's Arm Tavern is today run as a not for profit enterprise and all of the revenue from the restaurant, outside of operating costs, go to fund the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's educational programs."
"Kingsmill Resort & Spa, River Course, Williamsburg, Virginia - a World-Renowned Golf Course, Completely Renovated by Pete Dye","Virginia","Kingsmill Resort & Spa, River Course, Williamsburg, Virginia - a World-Renowned Golf Course, Completely Renovated by Pete Dye","The River Course at Kingsmill Resort has been a world-renowned golf course for more than 25 years, and in 2004 Pete Dye returned to oversee a design renaissance and renovation of his original layout. Changes to the River Course include the addition of tees, redesigned fairway bunkering on several holes, and re-contouring of several green complexes and resurfacing of the greens to allow for faster and smoother putting. The 18-hole, par-71 course is set in the lush heart of historic Williamsburg, bordered by the James River. The course plays to 6,831 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.7 and a slope rating of 139 on Bermuda grass. Even though the course has hosted a number of PGA functions over the years, the Dye redesigned softened'' the course to bring it more in line with a resort'' course, as well as its change to an LPGA venue. The course features plenty of bunkers close to the greens, which tend to be large, with some measuring more than 40 yards deep. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include No. 17, which is the signature hole for the course. This par-3 plays to 177 yards from the back tees and is set alongside the James River, which runs the length of the hole on the right, making for a scenic and challenging hole. The green is very large, a full 50 yards deep, but features a severely sloping apron that will carry errant shots into a bunker on the right or, even worse, into the water hazard. The only bailout area is short and left, but shots that carry long or too far left to that side of the green may find the trees or a gnarly lie in thick grass on a downhill slope with a chip back toward the river. The finishing hole is a par-4 that plays to 450 yards from the tips and requires similar accuracy off the tee, as the river now plays along the entire left side of the hole. From the tee, players must decide how much of the hazard to cut off as they take aim at the landing zone. There are also some fairway bunkers to contend with and two more that guard the green on approach shots. The River Course has received a number of honors and awards over the years, including a #6 ranking by Golfweek magazine among the Top Ten Golf Courses in Virginia. The course has also been host to a PGA event for more than 20 years. The Kingsmill Resort features practice facilities and a number of instructional options, including the Golf Academy at Kingsmill Resort. The resort also features a variety of accommodations and Stay & Play vacation packages, as well as activities and amenities.

"Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens","Virginia","Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens, Richmond, Virginia"," Visitors to the Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens in Richmond, Virginia may be totally unaware of the historical facts about the land that is today overflowing with flowers and plants in hundreds of varieties. The land, located at what now is 1800 Lakeside Avenue, was land on which the Powhatan tribe used to hunt. Later the land was owned by Patrick Henry. Lewis Ginter purchased the property in 1884. Upon his death, Lewis' niece, Grace Arents purchased the land along with a building that Ginter had built and called The Wheel Club. The Wheel Club had been used as a place for bicyclists to rest and visit. She added onto the building and turned it into a convalescent home for ailing children, and it was used in that manner until a convalescent home was no longer needed. At that point, Arents decided to use it as her residence. When she died in 1926, her will stated that her companion, Mary Garland Smith, had rights to the property until her death. After that time, the land would go to the city of Richmond and it was to be used to build a garden to honor her uncle. Smith died in 1968, but it was not until several years later in 1981 that a group of citizens joined together to see that the Botanical Garden would be created. Today, the Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens boasts over 50 acres of gardens. No matter what time of year it is, visitors will almost always find some of the flowers in bloom.  The garden, which is intended to be a walk-through experience, so no cars are permitted, also holds special events and educational classes throughout the year. There is a gift shop on the property and two places to dine, the Garden Cafy' and the Tea Room. If visitors would rather bring a picnic lunch, there are tables available in the Children's Garden. Many weddings are held in the Gardens each year, and the site also makes a beautiful backdrop for wedding photography and other portraits. One visitor from Boston said that she had visited several botanical gardens throughout the country and she felt that the Lewis Ginter was among the best.  Another visitor from Washington D.C. said that even though there were not as many varieties as at some other gardens that it makes up for it in the quality of the exhibits and over all disposition of the grounds.'' There is a fee for admission and it is a good idea to check the calendar when planning your visit to be sure that a section of the facility will not be closed for a private function."
"Lexington's Lee Chapel and Museum is a Virginia National Historic Landmark","Virginia","Lexington's Lee Chapel and Museum is a Virginia National Historic Landmark","The centerpiece of the handsome campus of Washington and Lee University in the college town of Lexington, Lee Chapel and Museum has played an important role in university life since its completion in 1868, when the 4-year private liberal arts school was known simply as Washington University. Construction of the chapel was proposed by then-president of the university, Robert E. Lee, who served as the school's leader from 1865 to 1870. However, his son, George Washington Custis Lee, is credited with ideas for the design, assisted by fellow Virginia Military Institute engineering professor, Colonel Thomas Williamson. Materials for the chapel came from the local area, including brick and Virginia limestone. The simple architectural style of Lee Chapel and Museum is best described as Victorian Gothic, sometimes known as Gothic Revival. This style of architecture was often used on university campuses throughout the 19th century and is characterized by arches, leaded-glass windows, and other features found primarily in cathedrals and castles of the middle ages. Lee attended daily worship services at the chapel as did the university students. When he died in 1870, his body was buried beneath the chapel, and in 1883, a Lee family crypt was part of a building addition constructed that year. The crypt contains the remains of several family members, and a memorial statue of Lee, designed by Edward Valentine, sits near the interment site. The lower level of Lee Chapel, which originally housed Lee's office, the treasurer's office, and the student center, became a museum in 1928 and remains open to the general public. Visitors should expect to see Robert E. Lee's office in its original 1870 condition as well as exhibits outlining the history of Washington and Lee University, a portrait gallery featuring works donated by the Washington-Custis-Lee families, and a museum store offering books, apparel, toys, and framed prints. Lee Chapel and Museum became a National Historic Landmark in 1961 and subsequently underwent extensive restoration for two years following the designation. For the celebration of the university's 250th anniversary in 1999, the museum also enjoyed an extensive refurbishing project. Today, Lee Chapel and Museum is an integral part of the community, hosting not only services for students and Lexington residents and visitors but also providing an excellent venue for concerts and lectures, accommodating about 500 audience members in its main auditorium. Numerous weddings also take place at the chapel throughout the year and use of the chapel for marriage ceremonies is open to the general public as availability dictates."

"Lynnhaven House, Virginia Beach, Virginia, A Colonial Home in a Modern Beach Town","Virginia","Lynnhaven House, Virginia Beach, Virginia, A Colonial Home in a Modern Beach Town"," The year was 1725 when a Virginia farmer by the name of Francis Thelaball built his home near the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The home was a medieval style cottage with huge chimneys that flanked the house on each end. Today, Lynnhaven House still looks much as it did in the early 18th century. Unlike some of the more well-known museum houses in the area, such as Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, this home provides a glimpse into the life of a middle-class planter rather than a wealthy plantation owner. Originally, the home, located at 4405 Wishart Road, stood on a 250 acre plantation. Today only five and a half acres remain, and on those acres visitors will find woods, a garden and a small Revolutionary War graveyard. In spite of the fact that the home has never had electricity or running water, it remained in use as a private residence until 1971. It was at that time that the property was purchased by the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA). Upon acquiring the property, the APVA began a massive restoration project. The home, built of brick in the English bond pattern, is about 85% original and all of the furnishings reflect what would have been found in a home in the early 18th century. The APVA not only maintains Lynnhaven House, but also provides educational programs for visitors and school groups. In 2006, the Colonial Education Center at Lynnhaven House was completed on the property. The modern 4,000 square foot building houses the welcome center and ticket sales for the museum as well as a gift shop and a theater where educational videos about Colonial life at Lynnhaven House are shown. Several costumed interpreters are always on hand answering questions and busying themselves with tasks and crafts just as they would have done in the early 18th century. The APVA works to make the experience of visiting Lynnhaven House interesting for young visitors by starting the tour by asking children Would you have liked to have been a child in the 1700's?'' The remainder of the tour is spent showing the children exactly what a day in the life of an 18th century child was like. In fact, visitors of every age can get a good idea exactly what their life would have been like had they lived at Lynnhaven House in 1725. Visitors can watch as Colonial interpreters plant seed, fashion barrels, work on quilts and take part in many other day to day Colonial activities. There is also plenty of opportunity to ask questions giving even more insight into the day in the life of a Colonial Virginia farmer."

"Mattaponi Springs Golf Club","Virginia","Mattaponi Springs Golf Club, Ruther Glen, Virginia - Named One of America's Greatest Public Golf Courses by Golf Digest in 2009","The Mattaponi Springs Golf Club is situated upon an estate that covers more than 330 acres, allowing for an un-crowded layout. The underlying terrain provides for dramatic elevation changes and diverse landscapes, including streams that cross the course at strategic locations, wetlands and other preserved areas, and well as distant, colorful hillsides. There's also a five-acre lake situated on the eastern plateau that provides both picturesque views as well as a lateral water hazard for several holes on the back nine. The course plays through gently rolling hillsides and forests of mature oak, beech, holly and pine trees. On some holes, the trees line the edges of the fairways, while also bordering several greens. In springtime, wild azaleas and native dogwoods provide a colorful contrast to the fairways and the links-style Fescue roughs. The course also features a number of manmade boardwalks, as well as natural earthen bridges as the layout plays through wetlands and crosses several streams and creeks. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which was designed by Bob Lohmann and opened in 2004, plays to 6,937 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 141 on Zoysia tees and fairways and L93 Bentgrass greens. It's been said that there are no tricks at Mattaponi Springs, and players can use driver on every par-4 and par-5 hole. The fairways are long and wide, and have also been sculpted to collect errant tees shots. Proper ball positioning is also important, however, and the course design is said to reward good shot execution. Some of the most noteworthy holes at Mattaponi Springs include No. 2, which is one of the signature holes for the course. A par-5, this hole plays to 543 yards from the tips and may be one of the most interesting holes. The hole features an initial landing area that's defined by two sand bunkers short and to the right, and another bunker long and left. There's a jog in the fairway to the right just past the bunkers, and tee shots that carry those bunkers will have a choice on the second shot of whether to attempt to carry the upcoming wetlands, or lay up to the left. Hole No. 11 is another signature hole, a par-4 that plays to 413 yards. This is another interesting and challenging hole which features a split fairway and dual landing zones off the tee. A tee shot to the left affords players the most room, but the subsequent approach to the green involves a difficult angle. A drive to the right landing area cuts 20 yards off the approach shot, but is a risky play as the landing area is about half the size of the one to the left. A relatively new course, Mattaponi Springs Golf Club was named one of America's Greatest 100 Public Golf Courses by Golf Digest magazine in 2009. Practice facilities include an all-grass driving range, as well as greenside and fairway practice bunkers, and putting and chipping greens. The course also features a Lodge and Conference Center, which is home to a pro shop, locker rooms and full-service restaurant."
"Maymont House, Richmond, Virginia, A Glimpse into the Opulence of the Gilded Age","Virginia","Maymont House, Richmond, Virginia, A Glimpse into the Opulence of the Gilded Age"," In 1893, James Dooley and his wife, Sallie, moved into their elaborate 33-room mansion located on the banks of the James River. The 12,000 square foot mansion was dubbed May Mont'' and the Dooleys owned the home until their deaths. It was the gilded age, a time when there was no income tax and no anti-trust laws. Businessmen, such as railroad baron Dooley, were able to acquire massive fortunes and they lived lives that were over-the-top in terms on opulence. Maymont House bears witness to that lavish lifestyle in every way. While there are many museum houses throughout the country, Maymont has the unique distinction of having been passed directly from the hands of the first owner to the city in which it resides. As a result, the home and its many rooms sit exactly as they did when the Dooley's called the mansion home for nearly 35 years. During the time that the house is open to the public, 12 of the rooms may be explored. Visitors will learn that Maymont, completed in 1893, had many conveniences that were state of the art. These included electric lighting, central heat and even an elevator. While some Americans were getting rich, others were working as servants. In grand homes such as Maymont, a staff of around ten domestic workers toiled to keep the home clean, cook all the meals and otherwise wait on the owners of the house. A tour of Maymont House not only offers a glimpse into the opulent lifestyle of the Dooley's, but a renovation of service areas of the house, which was completed in 2005, also allows visitors to learn how the servants in such a house lived and worked. Visitors can see the wine cellar, kitchen, laundry and the maid's and butlers bedrooms. The furnishings on the upper floors of Maymont are as extravagant as the house itself and include a swan bedroom set and an ivory and sterling silver dressing table and chair by Tiffany.  The collection of items that were left to the city of Richmond along with the house is extensive and includes 1200 books from the Dooley's personal library, many pieces of artwork including paintings, sculptures and glass objects, a mechanical organ with 26 wooden pipes and a variety of textiles. There is also a collection of Dooley's letters and other documents. The Dooleys had no children and when James died at age 81 in 1922, he left large amounts of money to several Richmond charities. He also said that Maymont House would be given to the city of Richmond upon the death of his wife. Sallie Dooley passed away in 1925 at the age of 79 and, according to her husband's wishes, Maymont House was passed to the city of Richmond. Within six months of Sally Dooley's death, the house was opened to the public as a museum."

"Mill Mountain Star and Park, Roanoke, Virginia, The Largest Free Standing Star in the Country","Virginia","Mill Mountain Star and Park, Roanoke, Virginia, The Largest Free Standing Star in the Country"," Many cities have an offbeat claim to claim, and among them is Roanoke, Virginia, a city with 92,000 residents.  Roanoke has the distinction of be able to say that it is the home of the Mill Mountain Star, sometimes called the Roanoke Star. The Mill Mountain Star is the largest, man-made free standing star in the country. The massive star was the dream child of the Roanoke Merchant's Association. This group of business owners wanted a fun new way to kick off the 1949 Christmas shopping season with a bang. It was for this purpose that the group decided to erect an 88 foot tall star that would be illuminated with bright white lights. When city officials in Roanoke realized just how popular the star was, they decided to leave it lit all year long instead of turning the lights out after the holidays. It has been there, shining brightly, ever since. The colors were changed from white to red, white and blue to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States in 1976. Sometimes, the star is lit with a special color or configuration of colors to mark a tragic or special event. For example, after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, the star, which weighs in at 10,000 pounds and can be seen from 60 miles in the air,  was lit in all white as sign of hope. While the star itself is 10,000 pounds, the supporting structure weighs in at 50,000 pounds and the base that supports it all is an amazing 500,000 pounds. Visitors to the star will have more to see than just an illuminated star. From Mill Mountain, which has an elevation of 1740 feet above sea level, and located directly in front of the star, is an overlook from which visitors can get a breathtaking view of the city of Roanoke. The overlook is a great place to have a picnic, or just relax and read a book. There is also a zoo that is continually adding new animals and expanding its exhibits. The park itself is maintained by the city and features trails for both hiking and biking. The Mill Mountain Star is illuminated each night until midnight, but to take full advantage of the views, visitors may want to consider an afternoon visit. A visitor from Houston said, Visiting in the late afternoon was a perfect time as you get the opportunity to look out across the valley as the sun is setting and then the star will begin glow behind you and begin to light up the hilltop.'' There is no admission fee to enter the park, which closes at 9 p.m."
"Mill Mountain Zoo, Roanoke, Virginia, A Small Zoo with Great Animals and Great Views","Virginia","Mill Mountain Zoo, Roanoke, Virginia, A Small Zoo with Great Animals and Great Views"," The Mill Mountain Children's Zoo opened in July of 1952. The name reflected the original nursery rhyme theme of the zoo. The zoo, which had been managed by the Roanoke Department of Parks and Recreation, closed in 1976 and reopened in 1977 under new private management. In 1983, the name was changed to Mountain Mill Zoological Park and the nursery rhyme theme was abandoned. Mill Mountain Zoo has been growing ever since with the regular addition of new exhibits as well as the updating of current exhibits. The zoo is very concerned with conservation and with protecting endangered species. Mill Mountain Zoo is proud to be the home of three endangered species of animals: Red Panda, Snow Leopard and White-naped Crane. Below is a sampling of other animal exhibits that can be seen at Mill Mountain Zoo. Corsac Fox Mill Mountain Zoo has the distinction of being one of only two zoos in the United States to have a Corsac Fox (the other is the San Diego Zoo). These animals are fairly social and, in the zoo, eat a diet of specially prepared dog food and rodents. Red Panda When hearing panda'' many people think only of the larger black and white pandas. The Red Panda, however, are also on the endangered species list. These small mammals, which weigh in at between 10-15 pounds, must be bred in captivity or the breed will not survive. Mill Mountain Zoo has been fortunate to see many cubs born under their care. Japanese Macaques These animals, sometimes called Snow Monkeys, are easily bored. For that reason, the zoo keepers and Mill Mountain Zoo provide lot of toys and activities that allow the Macaques to exercise both their bodies and their minds. Visitors can watch the feeding of the Japanese Macaques each day at 2:30. Snow Leopard Because these animals are often killed for their beautiful fur, the Snow Leopard is on the endangered species list. The zoo works with other organizations in order to be able to help the Snow Leopards that are still in the wild. The Mill Mountain Zoo also has a collection of reptiles, birds, including a Bald Eagle and the endangered White-naped Crane and even some interesting insects such as a Tarantula and a Giant Cockroach. A train, called the Zoo Choo, meanders through the zoo, weather permitting. Also, programs are offered throughout the year. There are summer camps, special zoo camps and even zoo sleepovers, where kids get the chance to have a behind the scenes look at some of the animals while enjoying a sleepover. Even though the zoo is smaller than many other zoos, visitors still find it to be well worth a visit. One visitor from Arlington, Virginia said, While this zoo is smaller than a big city zoo (such as NYC, San Diego, or Washington, DC), it has a good variety of animals in a very good setting on top of Mill Mountain with great views of Roanoke city and valley.''

"Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, Thomas Jefferson's Home","Virginia","Monticello, Charlottesville, Virginia, Thomas Jefferson's Home"," Visitors to Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's former plantation and home, will get a glimpse of what life was like in 18th century Virginia for both slave owner and slaves. Located near Charlottesville, Virginia, Monticello was once a thriving 5,000 acre plantation. There are records - which can be viewed online - that name each of the over 600 slaves that it took to run the plantation and its various operations that included, in addition to agriculture, nail making, textile production and barrel making. The mansion sits just as did when it was completed in the year 1784. Designed by Jefferson, the construction began in 1769. In 1796, a remodel and expansion project was started that took until 1809 to complete. It was in 1770, while construction was still under way that Jefferson first moved into the south pavilion. The home consists of 43 rooms. There are 33 rooms in the main house, 4 in the pavilion and another 6 rooms located under the south terrace. Much of the material used to build the house was gleaned from or produced at Monticello. The bricks and nails were made on site and most of the timber came from Jefferson's own land.  Because it was to be a fine house, some materials had to be shipped to the Monticello. All of the glass was imported from Europe and the window sashes, which were made from mahogany, were fashioned in Philadelphia.  The 11,000 square foot house, which is an example of Roman neoclassicism, has 13 skylights, 8 fireplaces and 5 indoor toilets, which Jefferson called air closets. There have been some reports that there was a rudimentary plumbing system in place, but there is no physical evidence of that at Monticello. Most likely, the toilets were emptied by removing and dumping the chamber pots. The home was heated by using the fireplaces. Ten cords of wood per month were required to keep the home warm during the Virginia winters. Amazingly, about 1/3 of the glass in the home at Monticello is original as are 60% of the furnishings. Many workers, both slaves and free, lived at Monticello. While there is documentation that some of Jefferson's slaves could read and write, it is not known if Jefferson encouraged such activity or if the slaves learned to read and write in secret. Visitors to Monticello not only tour the house, but are able to tour the beautiful grounds as well. This is why it is recommended to come during the seasons when there is mild weather. It is known that Jefferson loved his home at Monticello and it is this home that appears on the back side of the nickel. Unfortunately, Monticello would not remain in Jefferson's family after his death. When Jefferson died, he left a large amount of debt ($107,000) behind. The house was left to his daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, but because of the debt, she sold the house along with 552 acres for $4500. Today the house is owned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation which acquired it from the Levy family in 1923. The house and the 2,000 acres upon which it sits are a national treasure and about 500,000 people visit the site each year."
"Monument Avenue","Virginia","Monument Avenue, Richmond, Virginia Honoring Confederate Soldiers and Distinguished Richmond Natives"," The city of Richmond, Virginia is home to historical landmarks, arts and culture and a wide variety of museums as well as opportunities for outdoor activities. One Richmond landmark, however, is very unique. Monument Avenue, located in the city's Fan district, has the distinction of the being the only street in the United States that is a National Historic Landmark.  The tree-lined street is home to several monuments. The first, of Robert E. Lee, was dedicated in 1890. While one Richmond native is honored, most of the rest of the monuments are of Virginians who were Confederate participants in the Civil War. Below is a description of the monuments that can be found on the five mile long, residential avenue . This, the first monument dedicated on Monument Avenue, was shown to the public for the first time in May of 1890. Lee was the only man who commanded both northern and southern troops in the Civil War. He fought in many famous battles including the Battle of Gettysburg. Stuart fought in many battles including Gettysburg, Antietam and Fredericksburg. He died in 1864 at only 31 years of age. The Stuart monument was dedicated in May of 1907. Confederate president Jefferson Davis was a staunch supporter of the southern way of life, including slavery. Upon his death in 1889 he was buried in Louisiana, but his body was moved to Richmond in 1893. His monument was dedicated in June of 1907. Thomas Jonathon Jackson is better known as Stonewall Jackson. He earned the nickname thanks to the bravery he showed at the Battle of Bull Run. Observers of the battle said that Jackson could be seen standing like a stone wall''.  He was accidently shot by his own men and died at age 39.  His monument was unveiled in October of 1919. The Maury Monument was dedicated in 1929. It celebrates the man who is credited with developing the electronic torpedo. Maury is also known for his work in navigation and oceanography. He died in 1873. Arthur Ashe is the only African-American honored on Monument Avenue. He was an incredible athlete and won over 50 titles during his tennis career. As much as for his tennis, he is known for the work that he did to help underprivileged children and to remove racial and socioeconomic barriers. His monument, the last to be erected on the avenue, was dedicated in July of 1996. While many tourists visit the landmark throughout the year, an influx of visitors comes during Confederate History Month, which is celebrated in some southern states in April. During this time, members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans will gather in period costumes to remember the history of those who fought as confederate soldiers in the Civil War."

"Moses Myers House, Norfolk, Virginia, One of Norfolk's First Brick Homes","Virginia","Moses Myers House, Norfolk, Virginia, One of Norfolk's First Brick Homes"," Shortly after they were married in 1787, Moses Myers and his wife, Elizah Judah Myers, sailed from England to settle in Norfolk, Virginia. They were the first permanent Jewish settlers in Norfolk. Moses was a successful businessman. His import/export business made him one of the first millionaires in the United States. The home that he built for his family is a testament to his wealth. The Moses Myers house was built in 1792. It was among the first brick homes built in Norfolk after British attacks during the Revolutionary War had all but leveled Norfolk. One of the few remaining pre-Revolutionary War buildings, St. Paul's Episcopal Church, stands nearby, with a Revolutionary War cannonball still visible lodged in the brick exterior where Lord Dunmore fired it upon his retreat after being defeated during the Battle of Great Bridge. The 13 room, federal period home sits at 331 Bank Street.  Moses and Elizah raised 12 children in the home that they loved. They also entertained many powerful people when they visited Norfolk. Visitors to the house, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, included President James Monroe and Daniel Webster. Five generations of Myers lived in the house before it became a museum that was open to the public. In 1892, Barton Myers began a restoration project to bring the house back to its original glory. An astonishing 70% of the original furnishings are still in the house along with much of the artwork by artists such as Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Sulley and Daniel Webster. Even small everyday items, such as clothing worn by Elizah, her spinning wheel and her china also remain in the house and can be seen by visitors. There is a set of dueling pistols that some say were used in the duel between James Barron and Stephen Decatur. Another item that can be seen among the original Myers' belongings is a family bible. This may seem odd when one considers that the Myers were Jewish, but during that time Bibles were commonly used to record family births, marriages and deaths, so the Myers, even being Jewish, had a Bible that can be seen by visitors. In 2004, work began to restore the house to the color scheme that would have been common during the early 19th century. Work was completed in 2005 and now the Moses Myers house is a fine example of a federal period home. The rooms on the first and second floor can be seen by visitors. The outside kitchen and garden area can be viewed as well. The large number of original furnishings and other pieces that belonged to the original family make the Moses Myers house unique among museum houses."
"Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia, Home of the Nation's First President","Virginia","Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, Alexandria, Virginia, Home of the Nation's First President"," Mount Vernon, located in Alexandria, Virginia, was the home of George Washington and his wife, Martha, from the time they were married in 1759.  It was well-known that both George and Martha loved this plantation and both of them have their final resting places on the property. George Washington, the nation's first president, grew his estate, which sits on the Potomac River, from 2,000 acres to an impressive 8,000. He lived and worked at the plantation and in 1799, he died in one of the bedrooms of the mansion. In 1858, the Washington family sold the property to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, and it was opened to the public in 1860. Today, the public can visit this historic property and tour the mansion, the gardens and grounds and several outbuildings. The 21-room mansion features original furniture and many personal items owned by the Washington family. The home appears as it would have in 1799. An accurate representation was possible because experts worked from an inventory of items in the home that was written at the time of George's death. Some of the personal items include a chair that was used by George Washington during his presidency and a key to the Bastille that was presented to him by the Marquis de Lafayette. The many outbuildings include the kitchen, slave quarters, greenhouse, gristmill and stable. There is also a distillery where more than 11,000 gallons of whiskey were produced in 1799. Visitors can also explore the gardens, visit the tomb of George and Martha, where a wreath is laid each day, or visit the Slave Memorial. There are many farm animals on the property and visitors may bring their leashed dogs. One visitor from Louisiana said the history alone makes it worth a visit. The history is outstanding - you can actually feel it! The grounds are stunning and the house itself is well-preserved. Just to know you are standing or walking in exactly the same place George Washington did is fantastic,'' she said. Another visitor, from New York, enjoyed her visit, but recommends against the candlelight tour, at least for first time visitors. Because Mount Vernon strives to maintain the grounds as they would have been in 1799, there is little outdoor lighting. She wasn't able to see as much as she would have liked and planned to make another trip during the day. Many visitors said they have visited more than once, and visitors should plan on spending several hours to be able to see a good portion of what Mount Vernon has to offer. Mount Vernon is open to the public every day of the year, including Christmas. There are special programs throughout the year.  Be sure to check for updated pricing and a current schedule of events."
"Mount Vernon, Virginia Not Just for our First President Anymore","Virginia","Mount Vernon, Virginia Not Just for our First President Anymore","The most famous resident of Mount Vernon, Virginia is undoubtedly George Washington. In fact his residence has been designated a National Landmark since 1960 and is still visited by historians, scholars, and the general public to this day. The town of Mount Vernon may have borrowed its name from President Washington's estate, but it has plenty to offer on it sown. George Washington's estate cannot be missed while visiting Virginia. The estate was a working plantation and President Washington ran his business both efficiently and fairly. He depended on slaves to work the plantation, but had also promoted several slaves to positions of authority on his farm. At its peak George Washington employed more than three hundred men on the plantation and the skills he learned there where extremely beneficial to him later in life. The estate is very accurate in its depiction of the time period that George Washington lived and worked there. There are still many pieces of original furniture, art, decorations, and documents on display at George Washington's Estate and Gardens. They also serve dinner in full costume six days a week in front of the massive fire places throughout the home. Visiting George Washington's estate is a wonderful way to spend a weekend, but the nearly thirty-thousand people who live in work in the town of Mount Vernon have chosen to spend their lives there. The community is fairly affluent and the median income is just under $80,000 dollars per year. Their homes have a median value of $488,100 dollars. The people of Mount Vernon tend to work in professional services and public administration primarily. There are also many opportunities in the fields of construction, health care, finance, and educational services. The small town is less than an hour away from Washington D.C. and all that it has to offer. The museums, restaurants, tours, and National Monuments are enough to keep a person busy for quite a while if a resident needs a change of pace from the laid back lifestyle of Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon, Virginia offers the best of country life. There are colonial era homes and since George Washington resided there the area is steeped in history. Combining this with the fact that D.C. is so close by makes the town George Washington made famous a very attractive place to call home."

The museum consists of two separate facilities. One is the National Mall building located in Washington D.C. and the other is the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia. The Udvar-Hazy Center opened in December of 2003. On display were many items that were never before seen by the public. The Boeing Aviation Hangar allows the space for display of items for which there would never be room at the National Mall building. Aircraft are suspended on three levels in the hangar. Some highlights include the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, and the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, which is the world's fastest jet. Visitors will see crafts that cover various points in the history of air travel from the Boeing 367-80, which was built in 1954 and served as the prototype for the jet airplane to the Space Shuttle Enterprise. There are several exhibitions within the Boeing Hangar. Below is a sampling. Pre-1920 Aviation This exhibit covers the earliest aircrafts and includes planes that were used during World War I. General Aviation This includes planes that are not used either by the military or for commercial purposes. Included is a Piper J-3 Cub. Close to 20,000 of these popular planes were built between 1938 and 1947, when production ended. Sport Aviation This includes planes used for pleasure flying. Included in this exhibit is the Monnett Moni, designed by a school teacher in the 1980's and the Arlington Sisu 1-A, the same sailplane that won the United States National Soaring Championships in 1962, 1965 and 1967. World War II Aviation It was during World War II that metal planes began to replace those made of wood and because of the special challenges brought on by this war, other great technological advances were made during this time as well. One of the highlights of this exhibit, The Enola Gay, was mentioned earlier. Other highlights include the Lockheed P-38 and the Stinson L-5 Sentinel. Of course, the exhibits on space travel are always popular and those exhibits are housed in the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar.

Much of that history can be traced to an area concentrated within a 40 block radius known as the National Historic District or as Old Town Fredericksburg. Fredericksburg was founded in 1728 and it was named in honor of Prince Frederick Louis of Wales. The land became a town in 1871 and, a few years later, a city in 1879. The city has been home to four United States presidents. It was the boyhood home of George Washington, and many famous battles were fought in the city during the Civil War. The National Historic District is home to more than 350 buildings that were built before the year 1870. Many of those buildings are today private residences that can only be enjoyed from the outside. Others are open to the public. Here are just a few of the many historic buildings that are open for public tours. St. James House 1300 Charles Street While this is a private home, the person who resides in this home, built in 1760, generously allows the public to visit during two weeks each year. Mary Washington House 1200 Washington Street This home was occupied by Mary Washington, mother of George Washington, from 1772 until her death in 1789.  This home was purchased for his mother by George Washington in order for her to be close to George's sister, who lived nearby. Old Stone Warehouse These stone walls held all the merchandise coming into and going out of Fredericksburg in the mid 1800's. The building was struck by Union artillery several times during the Battle of Fredericksburg and after that battle it was used for a time as a morgue. National Bank of Fredericksburg 900 Princess Anne Street This building once housed the Farmers Bank, which opened in 1812. It was from the steps of this bank that President Lincoln spoke during the Civil War. The Farmer's Bank failed and the building became home to the National Bank in 1865. It has been in operation ever since. While some of the historic buildings are now private residences, many others are home to thriving small businesses. There are more than 120 businesses including small shops, art galleries, restaurants and coffee shops.

Highway US 19 uses the bridge to cross the New River. With the bridge being at a height of 876 feet that makes it the highest bridge in the Americas and the second highest bridge in the world. Locals of Fayetteville believe that the travel time from one side of the Gorge to the other has been reduced dramatically by using the bridge. Construction on the bridge began in June 1974 and was completed on October 22, 1977. The bridge was designed by the Michael Baker Company and built by U.S Steel's American Bridge Division. The bridge cost $37 million to complete. The bridge was built using COR-TEN steel, which created some challenges during the build such as ensuring that the weld-points weathered at the same time and the other steel used on the bridge. The bridge is host to `Bridge Day', which is an extreme sports event revolving around the bridge held on the third Sunday of October every year. This day is West Virginia's largest festival. There are hundreds of BASE jumpers and over 80,000 spectators to the gorge. Restaurants from the region also showcase their finest foods and creations. Traffic on the bridge is closed for six hours so that spectators are able to safely walk the bridge. BASE jumping is one of the most extreme sports and jumps have been happening on the bridge since 1979, in 2008 there were over 800 jumps off the bridge. Jumpers are able to make as many jumps as they can off the bridge within the six hour period, with the best viewing points being on the bridge. Visitors to Bridge Day are also able to use the Highline, which is a 600 ft rope that hangs from the underside of the bridge."
"Norfolk Botanical Gardens, Norfolk, Virginia, A Garden Always in Bloom","Virginia","Norfolk Botanical Gardens, Norfolk, Virginia, A Garden Always in Bloom"," In the 1930's, a horticulturist named Frederic Heutte and the city manager for Norfolk, Virginia, had an idea of planting a large, beautiful public garden that would draw visitors throughout the year. The city of Norfolk agreed to donate 75 acres of land and another 75 acres of the Little Creek Reservoir. In 1938, the pair received a grant from the Works Progress Administration for just over $76,000. Within one year, brush had been cleared and thousands of bulbs planted. Since that time, the garden has continued to evolve and grow and today includes 155 acres of themed gardens that visitors can view from land or by boat. Volunteers are a very important part of the upkeep of the gardens, and they give over 17,000 hours of their time each year. The Norfolk Botanical Gardens, located at 6700 Azalea Garden Road, has won many awards and visitors come from all over to visit. There is a small lookout spot where visitors can watch the planes landing and taking off from the nearby Norfolk International Airport. A gift shop and small cafy' are also available. The Norfolk Botanical Garden became well known to bird lovers and educators all over the world when a pair of American Bald Eagles made their home in one of the trees located on the property. A camera was installed and people anywhere in the world could log on to the eagle cam'' and watch. In 2008, the world watched as the pair finally had an eaglet after several eggs had failed to hatch. Sadly, the baby bird had to be removed from the nest to be treated for avian pox. One visitor said that she enjoys that fact that during the summer months, the garden has a theme which makes a visit fun for the whole family. She also said the boat ride made the visit even more memorable. During the summer, the garden also allows bikers to ride through the gardens on set nights each week.  There are 12 miles of trails from which bikers can enjoy the blooms while getting in a nice ride. Summer is not the only time that special events are held at the Norfolk Botanical Garden. For a few weeks each fall, the property is transformed into a scary Haunted Forest''. Visitors can ride the train through various horror scenes. Each winter the garden is transformed into a Christmas wonderland as thousands of light displays are erected throughout the garden. During the Garden of Lights'', cars are permitted to drive on the trails that meander through the gardens. Carriage rides are also available during this time. A per vehicle admission fee is required.

Ocean Breeze Waterpark is the only water park located in Virginia Beach. Because it is located just a couple of miles from the ocean front area, the nineteen acre park is popular with tourists as well as those local to the area. There are slides that cater to the adventurous and others for visitors who just want to get wet. Children are not allowed on every slide, and must ride with a parent on some others. Here's a sampling. Jungle Falls Visitors go through this attraction on a tube. The water is rather rough and features waterfalls. Bahama Mamma This slide is for those visitors who want a thrill.

A visitor from New Jersey said, OB was easy to navigate, had awesome water slides, an area for toddlers and babies, and a great wave pool.'' The same visitor also said, The best part about this park when compared to others was the lack of lines. At its busiest, we only waited about six-seven minutes to get on our favorite slides.'' A visitor from Maryland said, Parents of toddlers (or any child that cannot ride an inner tube by themselves) you cannot hold child in your lap even on the simple inner tube water slides!! So you'll be stuck between the kiddie pool and wave pool.'' Other visitors warned to keep in mind that there is a fee for every additional item.

"Old Cape Henry Lighthouse, Virginia Beach, Virginia, A Lighthouse Built in 1792","Virginia","Old Cape Henry Lighthouse, Virginia Beach, Virginia, A Lighthouse Built in 1792"," With the navigational technology available today it is hard to imagine a time when the best chance a sailor had for a safe voyage was dependent on properly placed and functional lighthouses.  There are still many operational lighthouses in use around the world but, of course, today seafarers have other options as well. They did not, however, have other options in the 1700's. It was in March of 1791 that John McComb began his work on the first lighthouse to be authorized by government of the United States of America. The work on the lighthouse, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was completed in 1792, at a final cost of $17,700, and was put into operation for the first time in October of that year. The lighthouse served those traveling by sea well for many years, but it fell into disrepair and rather than repair it, the government decided to build a new lighthouse. The New Cape Henry Lighthouse was built just 350 feet from the first. It went into operation in 1881. In 1896, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (APVA) placed a marker on the lighthouse commemorating the first landing on the shores by a group of settlers in 1607. In 1930, the government deeded the lighthouse and 1.77 acres of land to the APVA. Today, guests can visit the lighthouse, which is open to the public during the spring, summer and fall. Because the Old Cape Henry Lighthouse is located on Fort Story, a military base, visitors must pass through the security gate. Everyone over the age of 16 must have a valid photo ID. Visitors can walk up the cast iron spiral staircase to the very top of the lighthouse where they will be rewarded with beautiful views of the ocean. When the lighthouse was damaged in 1953 by Hurricane Barbara, the lantern was replaced and is now made of bronze and copper. Just next to the lighthouse is the spot where Captain Henry placed a cross in 1607 to thank God for the safe journey across the ocean to this new land. Today, a memorial marks that spot. Some visitors found the trek up the lighthouse steps well worth the effort. One visitor said, We went there during sunset and the view was beautiful. The waves were so powerful it was breathtaking.'' Even a visitor who was not as impressed with the lighthouse itself found the trip to be rewarding. One visitor from South Carolina said, The true gem here is the base that lighthouse is situated on. Hundreds of trails run through Fort Story (which is neighboring First Landing State Park). I prefer the base over the park any day. There are a lot less crowds once you get away from the lighthouse, and you can run, bike or hike in peace.'' Keep in mind that children must be at least 42'' tall to be allowed to climb the steps to the top of the lighthouse.  Check before planning your visit for current operating schedule and admission fees."

"Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia, A Church Steeped in History","Virginia","Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia, A Church Steeped in History"," Saint Paul's Episcopal Church, located at 815 Grace Street in Richmond, sits across from the State Capital and is home to an active congregation that participates in several outreach activities while embracing the history of the church in which they worship. The church holds several services per week, has activities aimed at children and seeks to minister to every member of the family. This church also has a rich history. The first church to be built on the site was called Monumental Church. Built between 1812 and 1814, the church was to serve as a memorial for 72 people who died in an 1811 fire in a theater that once stood on the site. When the size of the congregation grew too large for the church, the leaders decided to build an Episcopal church that could minister to the increasing congregation. In 1842, ambitious plans for a 1,000 seat church were set in motion. It would be the largest church built in Virginia up to that time. The new church was completed in 1845 and is a wonderful example of Greek Revival architecture. The leaders of the church during that period would not hold to mores of the time. They baptized, married and held funerals for blacks, both slaves and free. During the Civil War, Richmond was the Confederate capital. Both Robert E. Lee and Confederate President Jefferson Davis attended church at St. Paul's. It was also at this spot that Davis was informed that the Union troops were approaching Richmond. Visitors come to see the place where the famous historical figures worshipped and others come to see the beautiful stained glass windows. One visitor said, Beautiful church in the heart of downtown Richmond. You can see where Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee worshipped. Their pews are marked and easy to find. Many other historical features can be found. The pipe organ is very impressive as are the stained glass windows.'' So important is outreach to the current congregation that a full 20 percent of all money collected throughout the year is spent on the various outreach programs. Some of the outreach programs are listed below. Emmaus Ministry The church feeds a hot lunch to nearly 200 homeless men and women each Thursday. This ministry has been part of the church since 1973.

"Pembroke Mall","Virginia","Pembroke Mall - Virginia Beach, VA - a mall rich in history and diversity","There was originally farm land where Pembroke Mall now stands. Construction on the facility began during March of 1965. In 1966 the first twenty-one stores opened in the mall, shortly after two of the anchors Miller & Rhoads and Sears opened in the facility. Close to the middle of the mall was a Woolworth dime store and an expansion added Rices Nachamans as the third anchor during 1981. Four years later it became Hess's. In 1990 Uptons replace Miller & Rhoads which had closed earlier in the year. Hess's was replaced by Proffitt's in 1993 and then in 1998 by Dillard's as the stores were sold. During the middle of the 1990's Stein Mart was put in by Uptons as an additional anchor. The Woolworth chain closed during 1997, in 1999 Uptons closed and in 2002 Dillard's closed.

"Poplar Grove Golf Course","Virginia","Poplar Grove Golf Course, Amherst, Virginia - the Legendary Sam Snead's Final Golf Course Design and a Top Upscale New Course","Sam Snead was never a professional golf course architect, per se, but he and his son Jack got involved with a project that was intended to inaugurate the Sam Snead Golf Trail. Together, they worked with Ed Carton, a former member of Tom Fazio's design group, and undertook the Poplar Grove Golf Course in Amherst, Virginia. Toward the end of his career, it's said that Snead developed a sympathy for the average golfer, and the result is said to be on display at Poplar Grove. The course, which opened in 2004, plays through the Virginia hill country where Snead was born and raised and is set in the middle of lands wooded with trees, brambles and honeysuckle briars. Though Snead passed away before work on the back nine had begun, his influence is seen throughout the course, which is laid out on the site of a Colonial-era manor. Some of the duffer-friendly'' aspects of Poplar Grove include wide fairways that narrow only where longer hitters might place their shots. Snead also hated multi-tiered, penalizing greens, and he advised that the challenge come not from the greens, but from the hole locations, including the placement of surrounding bunkers. His vision was to have a target that the average golfer could hit, and the putting surfaces are generally large, gently sloped and receptive to approach shots. He wanted greens to be like a catcher's mitt,'' catching balls rather than shedding them. Snead also liked to start players out on the right foot, so the first hole is particularly player-friendly. The tee shot plays sharply downhill to a broad fairway, and tee boxes on the rest of the layout tend to be found on promontories, as Snead disliked uphill tee shots. The layout also features four lakes and a couple of creeks, which is said to be more water than Snead would have liked, but designer Carton tried to minimize the impact of such hazards. Perhaps the most visually daunting hole is No. 2, a par-4 that looks out over the arm of a lake on the left side. The tee shot, however, is still fairly easy and plays to a fairway that's 50 yards wide. The course layout is said to curve gracefully from fairway to fairway and has a rhythm to its flow, with the bunkering being characterized as awesome'' by some reviewers.  The green complexes are also said to be diverse, with some featuring a gentle slope, while a handful of holes feature a number of levels. Among the honors and awards already accorded Poplar Grove are a ranking by Golf Digest as the #8 Best New Upscale Public Facility in 2005.  The course is also home to several championship tournaments."

"Public Hospital Museum","Virginia","Public Hospital Museum, Williamsburg, Virginia"," Colonial Williamsburg is home to many buildings that depict life in early America. One of those is the Public Hospital Museum. The museum opened at 325 West Francis Street in June of 1985 and tells a story about the history of mental illness that goes back as far as 1773. In was in October of 1773 that the first patient was admitted to what was then called the Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds. The hospital was built at the encouragement of Virginia governor Francis Fauquier. He, like other modern men of his day, believed that mental illness could be cured if properly treated. This was the first hospital of its kind in the country and the first publicly owned building in which the mentally ill were housed and treated. Designed by Philadelphia architect Robert Smith, the brick building had 24 rudimentary cells, containing nothing more than a mattress and a chamber pot, to house patients whose care previously would been the responsibility of their family. Construction began in 1771 and took two years to complete. The cells each included an iron ring to which patients would be chained by either their ankle or their wrist. In addition to the building, yards where the patients could spend time outdoors were also added. While the thought that mental illness could be treated is correct, the methods used in the 18th century were not effective. Treatments'' included the use of restraints, very strong medications and shock therapy. The hospital discharged about 20% of patients, listing them as cured. The staff did not include full-time doctors. Instead, visiting doctors would come by to check on patients. Cleaning and other building maintenance as well as kitchen duties were performed by slaves who were assigned to the hospital. As the number of patients continued to increase, so did the size of the hospital. Additions were made until 1859 at which time there were 300 patients housed in 7 buildings. Treatment had changed by that time as well. The hospital, then called the Eastern Lunatic Asylum, traded the restraints and shock therapy for gentle encouragement and work therapy. In the late 1800's the building had fallen into disrepair and there were many reports of abusive staff at the hospital. James D. Moncure came on board as the reform superintendent. Shortly after his arrival at the hospital, a fire destroyed 6 buildings, including the original hospital. 224 patients were displaced by the fire. The hospital, by then called Eastern State Hospital, was rebuilt and remained at that location until the 1960's. Then, the hospital moved to a different site and the land was donated to Colonial Williamsburg. The Public Hospital Museum opened to the public in 1985 and is part of the Colonial Williamsburg tour. One visitor from Alabama said, This hospital museum tells in a simple, respectful and meaningful way the trials and drama of caring for the mental illness during a time when little was really understood about such a disease. It shows the conditions of their rooms and the theories that evolved about treatment. Surprisingly, there were some ideas that seem to have been ahead of their times.'' A visit to the hospital takes about an hour and adds a new dimension to a visitor's view of Colonial Williamsburg."

"Sandbridge Beach, Virginia Beach, Virginia, Swimming, Kayaking, Fishing and More","Virginia","Sandbridge Beach, Virginia Beach, Virginia, Swimming, Kayaking, Fishing and More"," There are many reasons why people like to visit Sandbridge Beach in Virginia Beach. Popular with both tourists and the locals, Sandbridge Beach is more than just surf and sand. Aside from the beaches, where dolphins are often spotted and beach goers can watch surfers take on the waves, there is also a host of other activities close by. Still, for some, the beach is enough. One visitor from Pennsylvania said she has been coming to Sandbridge Beach since she was a child. It's a lot more commercialized now,'' she said.  In many ways that is true as the popularity of Sandbridge Beach as a family resort area helped to spurn the commercial growth of the community. Today, there is shopping, abundant dining opportunities and nightlife options within very close proximity. Still, the beach is what it has always been, albeit a bit more crowded at times.  One major difference between Sandbridge Beach and the even more heavily visited Virginia Beach ocean front is that the feel at Sandbridge is more like that of the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Sandbridge Beach underwent a restoration project in 2007 and several tons of sand was trucked in to help and replenish the shore which had diminished as the result of several hurricanes that battered the beach over the years. One visitor from Fairfax, Virginia said, The biggest plus is that there are no giant hotels lining the beach. Just rental beach homes.'' Several realty companies handle the beach house rentals. While houses are available all year, the prices, obviously, go up dramatically during the peak summer months. At one time the only rental was beach houses, but there has been the addition of condo communities, which some renters favor. One said this, Our room was a three-bedroom unit on the first floor on the north side of the building, we had a partial ocean-view from our balcony.'' She said that the whole family loved the condo as much as the beach. Some visitors find that they rather enjoy coming in the off-season. We came in March and had the whole beach to ourselves,'' said a visitor from Pennsylvania. There were a couple of kayakers out on the water and it was just so quiet and relaxing.'' In addition to surfing, swimming and kayaking, fishing is another popular activity in Sandbridge. At the end of the 7.5 miles of beach is the Little Island Park which includes The Little Island Fishing Pier. The pier is a popular spot for both tourists and local residents. If fishing is on the agenda, keep in mind that a fishing license may be required and there is a small per-person fee to fish on the pier."
"Science Museum of Virginia","Virginia","Science Museum of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia"," The Science Museum of Virginia, located in Richmond, Virginia, features dozens of exhibits as well as other features that may not be found in other science museums. The Museum, located at 2500 West Broad Street in Richmond, opened its doors in January of 1977. Since that time, the museum has continued to add exhibits and grow in many ways. Below is a small sampling of what can be found among the permanent exhibits in the museum. Science Unplugged This exhibit allows children to participate in hands-on experiments that test engineering, science and physics theories. Space Gallery At this popular exhibit, visitors can learn all about space travel. They can see the effects of zero gravity, view a real moon rock and help to build a part of the International Space Station. Car ONE Car ONE (pronounced Car oh-en-ee'') is an example of the luxurious private railroad cars used by businesses and wealthy individuals during the time when railroad travel was among the most popular means of transportation. Reynolds Aluminaut On display in this exhibit is an aluminum submarine built in 1964. This sub was the first of its kind and set world records for the deepest dive of the time and conducted emergency salvage and scientific missions. There are also many demonstrations where visitors can actually see how something works from start to finish. As the Stomach Turns gives a view into the digestive system. You Make Me Sick shows how the human body was created to fight infections. There are dozens of these demonstrations throughout the museum. There is also an IMAX theater as well as the Carpenter Science Theater where live performances of plays with a science theme are put on by the Carpenter Science Theater Company. Most of the exhibits have been geared in such a way that they line up with what students need to learn in order to pass their Standards of Learning (SOL) tests. Many Saturdays from noon-4 the museum features Science Saturday'' where visitors get an even closer look at some of the exhibits and demonstrations and more hands-on opportunities are provided. One visitor from Colorado said that the museum was appropriate for visitors of all ages. She said, Our two science-oriented boys are 13 and 15, but there are many exhibits/activities for younger children also. We thought we would be there a couple of hours, but we ended up staying most of the day.'' Another visitor said that she enjoyed the museum in general, but was a bit disappointed because many of the exhibits were not working during her visit. She also felt that many of the exhibits were designed with younger children in mind. Check for current admission prices and event schedules before planning your visit."

With more than 40 hands on exhibits, visitors can play while they learn various facts such as how light waves create color. While the museum sometimes has to close some of the exhibits for restoration, most visitors had positive comments about their visit. A popular feature was the hands-on nature of many of the exhibits. One visitor from Churchville, Virginia said, Something to delight everyone with the hands-on, interactive displays showing how electricity works, how the human heart and circulatory system operate, weather phenomenoms, light displays, illusions and the list goes on. See fossils, bones, shells, rocks and gemstones. This is truly an amazing place.'' The Hopkins Planetarium is another popular feature of the museum. Shows are displayed on the 40-foot star dome''.  Visitors will learn about our solar system through shows such as The Cowboy Astronomer'', which shows the sky through the eyes of a cowboy or Follow the Drinking Gourd'', a show that is based on the book by the same name written by Jeanette Winter. Because museum exhibits and planetarium shows are always changing, it is a good idea to check for current schedules and pricing information when planning a visit."

This plantation has attributes that make it unique even among the other plantations in Virginia. Established in 1613, Shirley Plantation, located in Charles City, is the oldest plantation in Virginia.  The home and plantation has been operated by and lived in by 11 generations of the same family. Because it is still a working plantation, Shirley is also the oldest family run business in the country. Originally, the plantation included 4,000 acres set on the banks of the James River. Today, the plantation is 800 acres. The mansion, a two and a half story Georgian, was completed in 1738. It is open for tours and descendants of Edward Hill, who purchased the land in 1638, continue to live in the home and run the family business. Because the home has remained in the hands of one family for 11 generations, visitors have the unique opportunity to be able to see a colonial home that is complete with many pieces of the original furniture and other items, such as silver and family portraits, that have been in the home since it was built. There are also 8 original outbuildings including a two story kitchen, stable, barns, a laundry building and smoke house. Shirley Plantation is a National Historic Landmark. During the Revolutionary War, the plantation was a supply center for the Continental Army. It was used as a field hospital for the Union Army during the Civil War. It was in the Shirley Plantation mansion that Anne Hill Carter, mother of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was born. Because the upper floors of the home serve as a residence, only the first floor is included on the guided tour of the main house. Some visitors found this to be a disappointment. Additionally, some visitors were not happy with the amount of knowledge displayed by their guide, while others found their guide to be very helpful and able to answer any questions that they had. One visitor from North Carolina said, We had a good guide and the family history is just fascinating. Set in an area that it seems time has passed by. You can easily imagine yourself arriving by horse drawn carriage or boat. The details of family owned furniture, artwork and daily items is fascinating.'' In addition to the normal tours of the house, outbuildings and grounds, which are available each day, Shirley Plantation also hosts several special events each year. The Colonial Polo Cup is held here and there are seasonal and holiday themed events as well. It is a good idea to check for current events, hours and pricing information when planning a visit."

"The Gauley River National Recreation Area is a Whitewater Mecca","Virginia","The Gauley River National Recreation Area is a Whitewater Mecca","	The Gauley River National Recreation Area was established by the National Park Service in 1988 in order to protect 25 miles of the scenic Gauley River and a 5.5 mile segment of the Meadow River. Located near Summersville, West Virginia, most of the park is only accessible via the rivers, with few roads leading directly into the designated recreation area. Whitewater rafting is the main reason for a visit to Gauley River National Recreation Area. This stretch of river between Summersville and Fayetteville, West Virginia provide some of the best whitewater runs in the eastern portion of the United States along one of the best whitewater rivers in the entire country. At Gauley, prime whitewater season is in the fall months and approximately 60,000 visitors head there each year to run the river. Whitewater season at Gauley generally runs from the weekend after Labor Day through the next six weekends, which encompasses five 4-day weekends and one 2-day weekend, according to park officials. Rafting on the Gauley is not for the faint of heart. This river is wild and complex, stretching for some 28 miles and dropping more than 660 feet along the way. The terrain is scenic but rugged, and more than 100 rapids can be challenged along the way including many steep technical runs that produce huge waves and demand a good deal of control. The Upper Gauley River contains mostly Class III to Class IV rapids, which are best navigated by experienced paddlers. This stretch of the river offers lots of steep drops and wild chutes, and a good deal of rocky terrain demands lots of paddling and tricky maneuvering. The Lower Gauley River can be even wilder, depending on depth and run-off, featuring Class III to V whitewater along a 12-mile stretch. According to park rules, rafters must be a minimum of age 12 to run this portion of the river. On the third weekend of whitewater season, the Gauley River Festival is held. This is an event promoted by local whitewater outfitters and held in nearby Summersville, West Virginia. Established in 1983, it was first organized to celebrate the demise of a hydro-electric project that would have disturbed the flows of this mighty river. Sponsored by American Whitewater, a national non-profit that seeks to preserve and restore whitewater resources in the U.S., the event features vendors, auctions, raffles, food, and live entertainment. The Gauley River National Recreation Area is open year round and, at times, boating is possible during other times of the year, depending on the release of waters from the nearby Summersville Dam. Visitors can also explore the flora and fauna of the area, which includes a number of endangered species."

"The Luray Zoo, Luray, Virginia, A Zoo Where Unwanted Animals Have Found a Home","Virginia","The Luray Zoo, Luray, Virginia, A Zoo Where Unwanted Animals Have Found a Home"," The Luray Zoo is different from many other zoos in that its primary mission is to rescue exotic animals. Each of the more than 250 animals at the zoo has been rescued from one situation or another. Whether it was an exotic animal that the owner no longer wanted or it served as an ambassador for its breed and is no longer needed, the folks at the Luray Zoo have given these animals a permanent home. A visit to this rescue zoo will be different from the typical zoo visit in other ways as well. The zookeepers are always out walking around, interacting closely with the animals and making themselves available to answer any questions that visitors may have. The reptile center boasts one of the largest collections of snakes on the entire east coast. Among the snakes are King Cobras, Black Mambe and a West African Spitting Cobra. One visitor said that the venomous snake show was more amazing than anything on TV.'' In addition to the snakes, the reptile center is also home to a Nile crocodile, an American alligator and a Gila monster. For the younger visitors, there is a petting zoo featuring pygmy goats, deer, a donkey and a potbellied pig among others. Guests can purchase food for these animals and, as is the case in the rest of the zoo, staff is always close by to answer questions. Many visitors said that they sort of stumbled across the zoo by accident while visiting some of the nearby attractions such as the Luray Caverns. Most said that while the zoo was not a planned stop on their trip that it surely would be on their next stop through the area. One visitor said, The zoo is small, but very cozy, and the animal exhibits all seem roomy and well maintained. There are frequent demonstrations, shows, and feedings animals.'' She went on to say, we got the feeling that this is a refuge first, and a zoo second. We plan to visit again.'' The zookeepers would be glad to know that visitors feel that way as the well-being of the animals in their care is their top priority. On the zoo website it says, The animals that arrive at Luray Zoo stay here. They can have confidence that they will not be traded, sold or bred to for sale.'' In addition to providing a home for these animals, the zoo staff also aims to teach the public about the proper care of animals and about the importance of realizing that the responsibility of purchasing or adopting an animal should not be taken lightly. There are big cats, snowy owls, a wallaby and many other exotic animals, each with their own story about how they ended up at the Luray Zoo. Be sure to check current information for upcoming special events, prices and hours of operation."
"The Museum and White House of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia, The Largest Collection of Confederate Artifacts in the World","Virginia","The Museum and White House of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia, The Largest Collection of Confederate Artifacts in the World"," In 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, along with his wife and children, moved into a neoclassical Richmond mansion. He and his family remained in this house throughout the Civil War, earning the home the title White House of the Confederacy.'' Built in 1818 by Bank of Virginia president John Brockenbrough, the home was slated for demolition in the 1890's until some Richmond society women stepped in. Wanting to preserve this piece of southern history, the women won their fight to keep the mansion from being destroyed. The Museum of the Confederacy, located at 1201 Clay Street, is the oldest museum in Richmond.  The same group of Richmond women who saved the house from destruction began to curate items for the museum in 1892. In 1896, the museum opened to the public with items being displayed in the White House mansion. In 1976, the museum was moved to a more modern building. Today, the museum complex includes both the newer building and the White House of the Confederacy, both of which remain open to the public. The White House, which is open for guided tours, has been restored to look as it would have during the Civil War when the home was the social and political center of the southern states. The home, which is a National Historic Landmark, is decorated with period furniture and artwork and there are many items that actually belonged to the Jefferson Davis family. The Museum of the Confederacy holds the largest collection of Confederate items anywhere in the world. There are more than 15,000 items in the collection including flags, uniforms, badges, weapons, medical items and artwork. There are also a large number of everyday civilian items such as shoes, textiles, kitchen items and more. Additionally, the museum is home to an impressive collection of more than 6,000 Civil War era photographs including portraits and battlefield shots among others. The museum holds great importance to students of the Civil War. There is an extensive collection of research material regarding the Confederates actions during the Civil War. The museum also hosts many lectures and other special events throughout the year. Many visitors agreed that the museum has a lot of interesting artifacts and photographs that make the museum worth a visit. Many also noted that the museum is not, as one visitor said, kid friendly.'' Another visitor from Washington D.C. said, The Museum is a lot worn around the edges, but definitely worth visiting. There's a lot of reading. So it may become tedious for children.'' Occasionally, the White House is closed for repairs so it is a good idea to check for current operating hours when planning a visit."

"The Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, Headquarters for the Department of Defense","Virginia","The Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia, Headquarters for the Department of Defense","  The Pentagon, which is located in Arlington, Virginia, is the official headquarters for the Department of Defense. The neoclassical building replaced the 17 buildings that were once used by the War Department. The Pentagon, which was designed by architect George Bergstrom, was built in only 16 months at a cost of around $83 million. It was completed on January 15, 1943. At most, the building housed 33,000 workers. Today, 23,000 people, both military and civilian, report to work at the Pentagon each day. Until January of 2008, The Pentagon, which sits across the Potomac River from Washington D.C., held the record for the building with the most square feet in the United States. A building in Las Vegas was built that has over 30,000 more square feet than The Pentagon. Still, The Pentagon remains one of the largest office buildings in the world. There are 3,705,793 square feet of office space and over 17 miles of hallways contained in the five wedges'' that make up the building. There are five floors and two basement levels. There is also a five acre courtyard in the center. There is a state of the art gym and several dining options within The Pentagon as well. Interestingly, because the building was built during World War II, no marble was used. That is because marble is imported from Italy, a country that was an enemy during that war. The Pentagon was attacked on September 11, 2001 when terrorists flew American Airlines Flight 77 into the building. Sadly, 125 Pentagon employees were killed in the attack. Repairs to the building cost close to $500 million. Tours are free to the public and are available by reservation only. Most visitors agree that taking a tour is worth is even if only for the novelty of being able to visit the building where so many decisions that have had a huge impact on the country have been made. A visitor from Philadelphia said, I'm not sure what the tour would have talked about pre-9/11 because 40% of the talking points were about the damage to the building, etc. Still very interesting and the memorial room is quite touching.'' Some visitors said they arranged the tours through their State Senator's office. Visitors planning to take a tour should become acquainted with the strict security guidelines that govern all visitors to The Pentagon. Tours are not given on weekends or on any Federal holidays.

The mall was transformed from an enclosed mall to an open air centre in three phases. Construction began in the West and moved east. The first started at Elder-Beermen doubling their floor space. The construction phases overlapped so that the mall could remain open, therefore some stores were required to vacate their stores or relocate into the Gabriel Brothers end of the stores. It was important to keep `Kanawha' in the new name of the mall as it was known as the Kanawha Mall for such a long time. Part of the redevelopment included reconfiguring the mall so that parking is close to individual stores and each retailer having storefront facing to the parking lot."

"The Tradition Golf Club, Royal New Kent Course, Providence Forge, Virginia - an American Links-Style Golf Course That Measures up to Those in Scotland and Ireland","Virginia","The Tradition Golf Club, Royal New Kent Course, Providence Forge, Virginia - an American Links-Style Golf Course That Measures up to Those in Scotland and Ireland","It's rare that an American links-style golf course measures up to those found in Scotland and Ireland, where the winds sweep in off the ocean, but it's been said that the Royal New Kent Course at the Tradition Golf Club does. In fact, Royal New Kent was intended to depict a true Irish links design in the tradition of such renowned courses as Royal County Down and Ballybunion. The course plays across a wild and windswept landscape and features rolling moorland, grass-covered knolls and dunes, dry stone walls and some rough reminiscent of Scotland. The contoured fairways have been described as generous, but blind shots are often called for by doglegs and dunes. The course also features more than 120 bunkers, which are often deep pits lined with Fescue grass, and massive, fast greens often guarded by more pot bunkers and featuring bold swales and ridges. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,372 yards from the championship (Invicta) tees, with a USGA rating of 76.5 and a slope rating of 147, which make for some daunting number from the tips. Playing across a rugged landscape, Royal New Kent has been called the truest representation of an Irish links in America.'' The course, which opened in 1997, features some noteworthy holes, including its three signature holes. Hole No. 1 is a par-4 that plays to 418 yards from the back tees and features a 75-foot drop from the tee to the fairway, followed by an uphill approach shot to a two-tiered green with a false front. Hole No. 7 is a par-3 that plays to 197 yards from the tips and requires a precise tee shot. Missing this green will find either the creek that fronts it, or one of the bunkers on the right. Hole No. 18 is the last of the signature holes, a par-4 that plays to 463 yards from the longest tees. From the tee, players have to hit an island fairway landing zone, then take aim at a green with water in front, right and at the rear, putting water in play the entire length of the hole. Some of the accolades and honors accorded Royal New Kent include being named Best New Upscale Public Course in the Nation, One of America's Top 100 Greatest Golf Courses, and receiving a 41/2-Star Rating from Golf Digest, and ranking #23 on GOLF Magazine's Top 100 You Can Play list. Other amenities at Royal New Kent include practice facilities and a clubhouse with a pro shop and full-service restaurant and bar."

"Tomb of the Unknowns, Arlington, Virginia, In Honor of Those Missing in Action","Virginia","Tomb of the Unknowns, Arlington, Virginia, In Honor of Those Missing in Action"," The Tomb of the Unknown is located within Arlington National Cemetery. Intended to serve as a reminder of the many servicemen and women that are missing, the tomb holds the remains of an unknown soldier from World War I, World War II, Korea and, until 1998, Vietnam. The idea for the Tomb came from a similar memorial that is located in Great Britain. In 1921, the body of the unknown from World War I was interred near the center of Arlington National Cemetery after Congress passed a resolution which, in part, called for the construction of the Tomb. That unidentified soldier, whose body was recovered in France, was to represent every single soldier who was listed as missing during World War I. Since then three others have been interred within the tomb, each representing all who were missing during the war in which that soldier was killed. In 1998, DNA testing identified the remains of the soldier killed during Vietnam. Identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie. The remains were returned to his family for burial. The Tomb of the Unknown representing the Vietnam War is now empty, but still serves as a memorial for the missing of that war. The Tomb, which is one of most popular tourist attractions in Arlington National Cemetery is guarded 24 hours a day 365 days a year. The guards were originally ordered to guard the tomb in 1926 and only during daylight hours because some visitors were not treating the tomb with the respect and reverence they felt it deserved. In 1937, the guards began 24 hour a day duty guarding the tomb and that has continued to this day. To be selected for this duty is considered a great honor and there are very strict requirements that must be met. In fact, 80% of the soldiers who seek this duty are not selected.  Below is their creed. The Sentinels Creed My dedication to this sacred duty is total and wholehearted. In the responsibility bestowed on me never will I falter. And with dignity and perseverance my standard will remain perfection. Through the years of diligence and praise and the discomfort of the elements, I will walk my tour in humble reverence to the best of my ability. It is he who commands the respect I protect. His bravery that made us so proud. Surrounded by well meaning crowds by day alone in the thoughtful peace of night, this soldier will in honored glory rest under my eternal vigilance. Soldiers each work a 24 hour shift during which they take turns guarding the tomb in either 30 or 60 minute intervals, depending on the season. At the end of each 30 or 60 minute time frame, the changing of the guard occurs.  While guarding the tomb, the soldier marches 21 steps in each direction, signifying the 21-gun salute. The hours of Arlington National Cemetery vary depending on the season, so check for current hours when planning a visit."

"U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial, Arlington, Virginia, A Monument Dedicated to Those Who Died While Serving Their Country","Virginia","U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial, Arlington, Virginia, A Monument Dedicated to Those Who Died While Serving Their Country"," The Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia is the fruit of the fundraising efforts of Marines and the friends of Marines who raised the $850,000 needed to complete the memorial. No public funds were used for this bronze and granite statue that was dedicated by President Dwight Eisenhower in November of 1954. Designed by Horace W. Peaslee, the Marine Corps Memorial is often erroneously called the Iwo Jima Memorial. That is because it is the raising of the United States over Iwo Jima, an image captured in February of 1945 by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, that is depicted. The Memorial, which is cared for by the National Park Service, stands 78 feet high. The entire statue, cast in bronze, stands on a 10 foot high base made of Swedish granite. Inscribed are the names and the dates of every conflict in which the Marine Corps has been involved since the Corps was established in 1775.  There are two other inscriptions on the base of the memorial. In honor and memory of the men of the United States Marine Corps who have given their lives to their country since 10 November 1775 Uncommon Valor was a Common Virtue. (this was a tribute specifically to those who fought in Iwo Jima) The Marine Corps Memorial, which serves as the finish line for the annual Marine Corps Marathon, is located in close proximity to Arlington National Cemetery, just across the Potomac River from Washington D.C. While the statue depicts a particular battle, the Memorial is dedicated to every Marine who had died while in service to his or her country since 1775. By Presidential Proclamation, a cloth flag flies over the Memorial 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. During a visit in 2007, a former Marine named James P. Donovan was visiting the site. He noticed that the flag flying over the Memorial was not as it should be. It was out of a passion to do anything he could to make sure that a proper flag always flew at the Marine Corps Memorial that the United States Marine Corps War Memorial Flag Detail, Inc. was born. The organization, also called Iwo Flags, was formed in November 2007. To join the group, one must be a former or current Marine, but anyone is eligible to sponsor a flag based on approval by the group's board of directors. Flags are returned to the sponsor with a letter of authenticity once their use is completed. One visitor said of his visit, This war memorial represents the sacrifice of our WWII heroes, specifically of our Marines. If you are familiar with the history of the battle on Iwo Jima, you will be even more moved. If not, look it up before you go...It's a short but powerful visit.'' The Marine Corps Memorial is open to the public 24 hours a day."
"USS Wisconsin, Norfolk, Virginia, A Battleship Museum Operated by the U.S. Navy","Virginia","USS Wisconsin, Norfolk, Virginia, A Battleship Museum Operated by the U.S. Navy"," The USS Wisconsin was built in Philadelphia at a cost of $110 million and originally commissioned in 1945. This was the second ship to bear the name Wisconsin''. The first was decommissioned in 1901. During World War II, the ship performed a large number of operations including supporting operations against Iwo Jima and using its 16-inch guns, the barrels of which are 67 feet long, to fire on the Japanese city of Okinawa. After the war, the ship was decommissioned in 1948, but was brought back into service again. She was decommissioned a second time and brought back before her final decommissioning took place in September of 1991. The USS Wisconsin, which was one of the last battleships built by the United States Navy, now resides in a specially built berth at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum located inside Nauticus in Norfolk, Virginia. Since her arrival at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum in December of 2000, the USS Wisconsin, which is 887 feet long, has been a popular attraction. The museum and the USS Wisconsin are operated by the United States Navy. Visitors can visit the ship, which does not charge an admission fee, but the interior portions of the ship are not available for viewing. The reason that large portions of the ship cannot be viewed is that, even though the ship is now a museum, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2006 states that if needed, the USS Wisconsin can be returned to active duty at any time. To ensure that it is ready should the need arise, Congress has ordered the following: Wisconsin must not be altered in any way that would impair her military utility; The battleship must be preserved in her present condition through the continued use of cathodic protection, dehumidification systems, and any other preservation methods as needed; Spare parts and unique equipment such as the 16-inch (406mm) gun barrels and projectiles be preserved in adequate numbers to support Wisconsin, if reactivated; The Navy must prepare plans for the rapid reactivation of Wisconsin should she be returned to the Navy in the event of a national emergency. For the time being, though, the USS Wisconsin is a museum. There are volunteers on board during hours of operation to answer any question that visitors may have about the ship or the role it played during its many operations while it was of active status. Most recently, during Operation Desert Storm, the ship fired 24 Tomahawk missiles. One visitor from Indiana said, Unless you serve in the military, your chances of going on a battleship are slim. That's why being able to visit this gem is a life altering, historical experience.'' The ship may be closed to the public from time to time for private functions, so it is a good idea to check about specific dates when planning a visit."

"Virginia Holocaust Museum, Richmond, Virginia, An Interactive Look at the Holocaust","Virginia","Virginia Holocaust Museum, Richmond, Virginia, An Interactive Look at the Holocaust"," The Virginia Holocaust Museum is not as large as the United States Holocaust Museum, located in Washington D.C., but it provides visitors with an experience that is truly unique. Founded in 1997 by Mark Fetter, Al Rosenbaum and Holocaust survivor, Jay Ipson, the Virginia Holocaust Museum aims to place visitors in the scene and allow them to view the Holocaust through the eyes of the victims. The museum was originally housed in a few room of a local temple. In 2003 the doors opened for its new facility: an old tobacco warehouse that was donated by the state of Virginia. To accomplish the goal of allowing visitors to feel as though they are part of the events of the Holocaust, the exhibits feature life-size recreations of various Holocaust related places. Visitors can walk through a ghetto, see full-size replicas of important places, board a cattle car like the ones used to transport victims to concentration camps and even crawl into a hiding place like one that was used by several Jews trying to evade capture. In order to be accessible to all patrons, the museum provides an alternate route for those visitors who cannot crawl through the exhibit. Many visitors said that visiting the museum was one of the most moving experiences of their lives. Some who have also visited the Holocaust museum in D.C. appreciated the smaller, more personal feel of this museum. Said one visitor, There are plenty of pictures, plenty of audio, and plenty of hands-on exhibits that you can actually touch and be a part of.'' The same visitor also said, The museum makes fantastic use of large-scale reinterpretations of places and events and effortlessly guides you on your own through the use of personal audio equipment (mp3 players and headphones.)'' Visitors to the museum, located at 2000 East Cary Street, have the option of a self-guided audio tour, which is narrated by Holocaust survivor Jay Ipson, or a self-guided book tour. The museum includes 28 total exhibits, each focusing on a particular theme or event.  One, which was added in May 2008, is a replica of the courtroom in which the Nuremburg Trials were held. There is also a Survivor's Room'' where guests are welcome to reflect in quiet meditation and several special events and programs are held throughout the year. Because of the nature of the museum, there are some photographs and exhibits that are too graphic for young children. For this reason, the museum recommends that only children over the age of 9 attend. Also, it is recommended that parents walk through exhibits in order to decide if each is appropriate for their child. The museum website offers several suggestions for reading materials that can help visitors prepare for a visit.  The website also provides updated exhibit information as well as information about upcoming special events, lectures, film screenings and other programs."

Since that time, the museum has continually grown and changed into the popular and important art museum that it is today. One of the earliest donations, in fact, continues to be among the most popular. In 1947, some jeweled objects created by Peter Carl Faberge, including five Faberge eggs, were donated. Between the donations and the acquisition program, which was funded entirely by private donations, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts had to undergo several expansion projects over the years in order to house its ever increasing collection. This growth continues today. The museum was 380,000 square feet before an expansion project that began in 2005. By its completion in early 2010, the museum will be 490,000 square feet. Right from the beginning, donations of important pieces are artwork have been a driving force behind the success of the museum. The museum, located at 200 North Boulevard, is home to more than 20,000 pieces of art. Some of the continuing exhibits are listed below.

European Art in the Great Hall The Great Hall is a large space in which paintings that are substantial in size are displayed.  Some of the important works in the collection include Venus and Cupid by woman artist Artemisia Gentinleschi (1593-1652) and Adoration of the Shepherds painted in 1712 by Paolo de'Matteis (1662-1728).

"Virginia Museum of Transportation, Roanoke, Virginia, A History of How People ``Got Around'' in Virginia","Virginia","Virginia Museum of Transportation, Roanoke, Virginia, A History of How People ``Got Around'' in Virginia"," In 1963, the Roanoke Transportation Museum opened its doors for the first time. At that time, the key exhibits included a United States Army rocket and a J class locomotive that had been donated by Norfolk & Western Railway. As the museum grew, other key artifacts outlining the history of transportation were added including a horse-drawn hearse and other transportation treasures. Unfortunately, a flood in 1985 destroyed most of the collection and did much damage to the museum itself. Six months later, the museum reopened in a different location and under a new name: The Virginia Museum of Transportation. The name change came as a result of being named Virginia's official transportation museum by the state's general assembly. Since it's reopening in 1986, the museum has continually added to its collections. The impressive railroad collection still includes the J class locomotive that was part of the original collection and now also includes a Norfolk & Western A class, a Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive, a Virginian Railway EL-C electric locomotive, the last remaining steam locomotive from the Virginian Railway and more than 50 other pieces of railway transportation history. Below are some examples of the permanent exhibits included in the railroad portion of the museum. African American Heritage on the Norfolk and Western Railroad: 1930-1970 This exhibit includes audio clips of interviews, photographs and other items relating to the many African-Americans who worked for the railroad. Big Lick This exhibit is a replica of a train depot like one would have found in a small 1930's town. Many authentic artifacts are on display including telegraph equipment and freight scales. The automobile collection features the permanent exhibit titled From Mud to Mobility: A History of the Virginia Department of Transportation.'' The floor in this section of the museum is in keeping with the theme and as visitors explore the exhibit they go from walking on a dirt road to an interstate highway.  Replicas of period billboards are also displayed as are several fine examples of automobiles from throughout the decades. The museum gets mixed reviews from visitors. Some say that there is not much to see, while others seemed to enjoy their visit. Even those who said it wasn't worth the trip found something interesting, though. One visitor from Maryland said, The only exhibits it had worth seeing were the J and A class locomotives. The other railroad cars were run down...They did say they were making improvements.'' Since that visitor wrote his review, many additions have been made to the museum's collections. The car collection now includes some rare models such as the 1932 Ford Model B Closed Cab Pickup and the 1948 Packard Limousine. Other cars in the collection include a 1957 DeSoto, 2 Studebakers and even a fine example of a Connestoga covered wagon. The museum continues to grow and change so it is a good idea to check for current exhibits and schedules when planning your visit."
"Virginia Safari Park, Natural Bridge, Virginia, A Drive Through Zoo Where Animals Roam Free","Virginia","Virginia Safari Park, Natural Bridge, Virginia, A Drive Through Zoo Where Animals Roam Free","  Virginia Safari Park opened in Natural Bridge, Virginia in 2000.  The goal of the park is to give visitors the chance to see animals in a somewhat more natural environment than what is found at a zoo. At Virginia Safari Park, located at 229 Safari Lane in Natural Bridge, Virginia, most of the animals roam free. Visitors can get up close and personal with camels, zebras, bison, elk and many others. There are also enclosures featuring other animals such as monkeys, kangaroos and tigers. Upon admission to the park, which includes 180 acres, visitors can purchase buckets of feed which can be used to feed the animals, which hail from six continents. In addition to the drive-through portion of the park, there is also a walk-through area. Safari Village was completed in 2005 and is a ten acre area where visitors can see, pet and feed animals, including a giraffe. There is also an aviary where birds can be seen in free flight. Most visitors seem to agree that this trip is a good outing for the whole family. Many visitors comment on the fact that many of the animals are not shy about wanting the feed. One visitor from North Carolina said, The animals were great! Most of them are not afraid to approach you to eat from the feed buckets. This is as close as you'll get to some animals you usually only see behind bars in a zoo. We got to feed zebras, llamas, buffaloes, ostriches, camels, etc. Most of these animals did not mind being touched and petted. Our highlight of the trip was when my husband was feeding a buffalo through the car window. When he felt the buffalo had had enough to eat, he tried to bring the little bucket back into the car, and the buffalo came right in with it! He had his whole head in the car and had my husband pinned in. We laughed until we were crying!'' There is an option to ride in an open wagon rather than driving a personal vehicle through the park. For visitors who are concerned about their car getting spit and feed all over, it might be a good idea to ride in the wagon. While cars are unlikely to suffer any real damage, the animals can make quite a mess. The admission price is good for the entire day and allows visitors to drive through as many times as they'd like. Driving through more than once is recommended in order to see as many of the park's animals as possible. Hours change depending on the season so check for current operating hours and admission prices when planning a visit."

"Virginia Zoo, Norfolk, Virginia, Animals and Horticulture Combined","Virginia","Virginia Zoo, Norfolk, Virginia, Animals and Horticulture Combined"," The Virginia Zoological Park at Norfolk, more commonly called The Virginia Zoo, has been welcoming visitors since it first opened in 1901. The zoo, located at 3500 Granby Street, features a selection of animals including African elephants, African lions, Siberian tigers, giraffes, rhinoceroses, zebras, farm animals a reptile house and many more. In addition to animals, the Virginia Zoo is also home to the Virginia Barn where those interested in horticulture can see an extensive collection of both heirloom and modern plants.  The zoo gardeners also keep the exhibits looking as authentic as possible by keeping the flowers and plants healthy in and around each of the animal exhibits. Children can have birthday parties at the zoo, and there are many special family programs offered throughout the year as well. In the spring, the Virginia Zoo offers a day camp for children ages 5-12. Campers can attend as few or as many days as they choose and a different topic is covered each day. Another popular zoo program is the Zoo Snooze. The Zoo Snooze allows organizations to essentially have a sleepover at the zoo. Snoozers are able to get some behind the scenes time with select zoo animals and are offered a flashlight tour of the zoo after dark. The Zoo Snooze is popular with scout troops, school groups and also as a fun and unique birthday party idea. Some annual events are geared for the adult zoo guest. The Rock N Roar, which typically takes place each spring, is basically a rock concert that takes place in the zoo.  The annual zoo fundraiser, Zoo to Do, invites guests to dress in animal themed black tie'' and eat and dance the night away while helping the mission of the Virginia Zoo. The zoo began an intensive renovation process in the 1990's. Since then, many upgrades have been made making the zoo better for both the animals and for zoo guests. One visitor from Boston was impressed with many of the changes at the zoo. When I visited the zoo in the early 1990's, I was disappointed,'' she said. But many of the newer additions, such as the Africa exhibit, are first-class. I look forward to seeing what other changes they will make in the future.'' Another visitor felt that some of the animals, particularly the reptiles, were housed in areas that were much too small. Even those that do not agree on the quality of the exhibits or the care and condition of the animals, do typically agree on the quality of the landscaping and the overall cleanliness of the zoo. One visitor who found the zoo to be average at best'' went on to praise the zoo for its cleanliness."
"Virginia Zoological Park","Virginia","Virginia Zoological Park - Norfolk, Virginia - medium public zoo with 400 animals on 53 acres","The Virginia Zoological Park is a mid-sized zoo located in Norfolk, Virginia. At just over 100 years of age, it is also one of the older zoos in the country. The City of Norfolk purchased 65 acres of land with the intent of creating a public park. In 1899, the city officially named the land Lafayette Park, and a year later, the park began acquiring animals to put on exhibit. By 1901, the Lafayette Park zoo had acquired over 200 animals including mammals, reptiles and birds. The zoo continued to make improvements. In 1910, the zoo consisted of numerous exhibits separated by paved roads so that visitors could drive through the park and view monkeys, ducks, sea lions and even a bear in their outdoor cages and exhibits. The next upgrade to the Lafayette Park zoo didn't come until 1948, when the city opened a petting zoo called the Mother Goose Barnyard, allowing city children to meet farm animals like pigs, ducks and turkeys. A few years later, in 1954, the zoo built a new stone pool for the sea lions to enjoy, and in 1969, the zoo embarked on its most ambitious construction project since its early years - the construction of a Mammal House which would house African elephants, a rhinoceros and a tapir. Finally, after 75 years, the city fenced off the animal area from the city park, creating a separate facility which was named Lafayette Zoological Park. For the next several years, the city worked on removing the older exhibits and making improvements to the zoo. After the Friends of the Zoo was established to help advise and manage the Lafayette Zoological Park, the zoo was renamed the Virginia Zoological Park at Norfolk, which is more commonly known as the Virginia Zoo. The Virginia Zoo received its accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 1989 and has maintained that AZA accreditation since. Also in 1989, the Friends of the Zoo changed its name to the Virginia Zoological Society and took on the new responsibility of raising money and community awareness for the Virginia Zoo. Beginning in 1992, the City of Norfolk and the Virginia Zoological Society embarked upon an ambitious master plan to rebuild and refurbish the Virginia Zoo. The master plan included a new zoo geographic layout with five continental exhibits and a new Education Complex and Visitor Center. In 1992, the city and the zoo shared a heartwarming moment when the zoo temporarily took over the care of a pair of Siberian tiger cubs. The community fell in love with them, and while the zoo was busy building and raising funds for an African exhibit, the community came together and raised funds for the first new major exhibit at the Virginia Zoo in nearly thirty years. Today, the zoo is visited by hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. In addition to the animals housed in five zoo geographic exhibits, visitors can ride the Zoo Train, play on the kids' playground and enjoy the beautiful landscaping of the Horticultural Gardens. The Virginia Zoological Park is open year round except Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Years Day. Hours of operation are 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Admission is $7.00 for adults; $5.00 for children, with discounts available for groups, zoo members, seniors and special events.

There are more than 30 rides all set in a 1950-1960 surfer theme. Some of the rides have age and/or height restrictions, but there are rides for visitors of all ages available at the park. The largest ride is the Hubba Hubba Highway. This ride is over 1500 feet long and takes up nearly 3.5 acres. There are more than 30 rides in all. Below are just a few examples of the many rides and attractions in the park. Big Daddy Falls This ride sends visitors through 670 feet of flumes, tunnels and twists. Aquazoid This is the largest family ride within the park. Four person rafts bring guests through dark tunnels and shooting over waterfalls. Nitro Racer This slide allows guests to partake in a little friendly competition to see who can make it to the bottom first. Six guests at a time can compete for first place. Cow-A-Bunga This heated pool is part of the children's play land. Guests will find interactive activities, a bubble area and slides designed with kids in mind. Surfer's Bay This is the largest wave pool in the state of Virginia where visitors can ride four foot waves. Many visitors said that they enjoy the fact that there are attractions geared toward every age group in their family. Others were disappointed at the lines and the crowds. During the hottest months, guests report lines of up to 60 minutes to get on some of the slides. Other visitors who went to the park in July and August reported no wait more than 15 minutes, so it seems the size of the crowd depends on the day of the week and perhaps somewhat on the luck of the draw.  Some attractions, such as Hubba Hubba Highway, have no wait, but visitors said they were very crowded. One visitor from Canada said, Just spent the entire day at Water Country with my 5 year old and 8 year old. I liked the efficiency of the fingerprint recognition technology that they use at the entrance of the park. Everything was so well organized and clean. I thought we were going during high season...but there were no real line-ups other than 3 of the biggest rides - and then the waits were between 30-45 minutes. The park is neither too small nor too big. Everything is well connected and it's easy to find your way...My kids loved everything. I especially couldn't tear them away from the Hubba Hubba waterway, essentially a stream that gently pushes people though about 1 km of water in a type of racetrack format.'' Within the park there are several dining options. Picnics are allowed only at designated spots in the parking lot. Coolers may not be brought into the park. There are also bathhouses for use by guests and the use of life vests and inner tubes is included in the admission price.

The two story structure, located right on the mouth of the Elizabeth River in downtown Norfolk, Virginia, was originally part of a plan to help revitalize the downtown area of the city, which had been in a decline ever since the end of World War II. Waterside, located on Waterside Drive, was successful, but business began to decline in the mid-1990's prompting some changes. Many of the spots once occupied by retail shops were replaced by nightclubs. More restaurants were added as well. There are still some retail shops, but most of the revenue comes from patrons dining or visiting one of the nightclubs. There are several nightclubs in Waterside Marketplace. They include BAR Norfolk, Club Mojo's (also known as Jillian's), Have a Nice Day Cafy and the Southern Star. Restaurants include Hooters, Outback Steakhouse and Joe's Crab Shack. Because Waterside Marketplace is within walking distance to other popular Norfolk attractions, such as Nauticus and baseball's Tide's Harbor Park, it makes a great stopping place for lunch or dinner during a day spent sightseeing in Norfolk. Waterside is also home to the Waterside Marina. Both day and evening cruises as well as ferries launch from this marina throughout the day. The Spirit of Norfolk offers both lunch and dinner cruises. Many times there will be a special performer on the cruise or a theme will be in place. The Carrie B Harbor Tours, which have been in operation since 1959, are often voted the best sightseeing cruise in Virginia. Visitors to Harbor Park can hop on a ferry, operated by Norfolk's transportation department, and take a short trip across the river to Portsmouth where several more attractions, such as the Sports Hall of Fame and the Children's Museum are within easy walking distance from the dock. There is plenty of parking at Waterside Marketplace. Two large parking garages are within walking distance and one is connected directly to waterside by a pedestrian bridge that crosses over Waterside Drive. In addition to the shopping, sightseeing, dining and nightlife, Waterside Marketplace and Waterside Marina are also the homes for several events throughout the year.  Each Saturday night, the Marketplace hosts Saturday Night Party''. The event features a different entertainer each week. Waterside is a popular spot from which to watch July 4th fireworks and other large events, such as the Harborfest, featuring the tall ships, outdoor concerts, boat shows and ethnic festivals are held on the land adjacent to the Waterside Marketplace throughout the year. Because Waterside is always growing and changing, it is a good idea to check for updated event and other information when planning a visit."
