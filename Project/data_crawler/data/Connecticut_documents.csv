"Audubon Arts District","Connecticut","Audubon Arts District","The stretch of Audubon Street from Orange Street to Whitney Avenue is called the Audubon Arts District. At a time when the city was on unsure footing, homes were being built, but many buildings were undergoing demolition, architect Charles Brewer developed a master plan for the area. Part of the plan was to support existing, self-sustaining institutions. This included mixed-use development including housing, educational buildings, retail and institutional space. This mixed-use plan freed up funds for the project that may otherwise not have been available. The inclusion of housing space meant there were built-in visitors to the cultural attractions in the area. People were more likely to participate in the art programs and support the retail space if it was right outside their door. While the project did experience some setbacks, it was ultimately successful because the project was not overly politicized and the project managers and architect stuck with it. Today, the space is filled with cultural activity and plenty of people in residence, as well as a fair share of local visitors. Supporting the arts is an important part of the New Haven community and the Audubon Arts District provides locals and visitors with a place where they can put their money where their mouth is. "

The chimney and door of the building are not centered and the windows are asymmetrical, which is common in Georgian design. The building has seen a lot of evolution over time and continues to reflect the history and culture of the town of Essex. Different parts and levels of the house were constructed at different times. Most historians put the date of the second floor addition somewhere between 1790 and 1800, while the back of the home was likely built before 1700. The front section built by John Pratt, Jr., was likely added in 1732. L.T. Pratt was the original owner of the home and the founder of Essex. Tours of the home guide visitors through the front door, past a small front colonial entrance. There is only one mantel in the house and it is located in the front parlor. The color of the trim has been changed over the years, but the chestnut floors are likely remnants from 1732. Pratt House served as rental property in the 1920's, owned by the Griswold family. The Griswold family sold the home to the Society for the Preservation of New England who got the home up and running as a museum. They transferred ownership in 1985 to the Essex Historical Society. Today the interior and gardens surrounding the home offer a historical view into what life was once like in Essex. "
"Putnam Cottage","Connecticut","Putnam Cottage","The Putnam Cottage is a red brick home located on Boston Post Road in Greenwich, Connecticut. The home has an interesting historical story. It was built in the 17th century and has changed shape and size over the years. The building features aspects that were unique to the period of history in which it was built, but it has changed over time to reflect various phases in architecture. The history of the house may be best known for its association with General Israel Putnam, but it was likely built for Timothy Knapp and his family. Putnam had a historic escape during the Revolutionary War. The home was purchased by a group of concerned citizens in 1901 and the deed was presented to the Israel Putnam Association a year later. The house became a public museum in 1906, exactly 100 years after Putnam's escape. The name was never officially declared the Putnam Cottage, but over time people just continued to call it that and it eventually stuck. Putnam's association with the house was just a brief part of the home's history, yet it became synonymous with the home. Changes in the home's design began in the 19th century when the ceilings were raised, a porch was added and the windows were changed. It remained basically the same throughout the 20th century. "

There are several world-important collections at the museum. The most notable are the vertebrate paleontology collections, which are among the largest and most important fossil collections in the United States. The Collection of Incan artifacts from Machu Picchu, was named for the Yale archaeologist who discovered the ruin. There is also the extensive collection or ornithology, which is one of the largest and most taxonomically inclusive in the world. The Museum was the first to erect the full-scale reproduction of a Pterosaur's, which is a 3m tall, 7m long, and 3.33 metric ton statue sculptured in clay and cast in bronze, set on a 4m tall granite base. The skin is based on fossilized skin impressions that were left by a closely related ceratopsid.

The staff include curators, assistant curators, curatorial affiliates and volunteers. The Dioramas at the museum are considered masterpieces, which move visitors' eyes effortlessly from the specimens in the foreground to the background. The diorama is accepted casually as if it were a window into the natural world. The dioramas combine three dimensional foreground material with a curved background and domed ceiling to tell the story of the ecosystem. The museum was featured in an episode of The Simpsons, `Burns, Baby Burns', where Mr. Burns has a relationship and makes love in 1939 at the museum after his 25th graduation class reunion, in front of the exhibit that features Eskimo's and penguins, which is similar to the permanent diorama exhibit on the third floor."
