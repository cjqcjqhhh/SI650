Alki Beach has a two and a half mile long pedestrian walkway and provides a popular hang-out for sun worshipers, beachcombers, and volleyball players. Most of the beaches on Puget Sound are covered in rocks and rough terrain, but on Alki Beach, visitors can walk in the sand, get some exercise, learn about Seattle's earliest settlers, and take in a great view of the city's skyline. Alki Beach can be easily reached by car via the West Seattle Bridge. From downtown Seattle, travelers follow the signs onto Interstate 5. Take the exit for West Seattle and once across the bridge, turn right onto Harbor Ave SW. This will lead around the tip of Duwamish Head, and onto Alki Point. Parking can be complicated on the weekends, but street parking not too far from the main strip along Alki Avenue SW is available. During the summer, leave the car behind and take Metro's water taxi. The taxi leaves from locations between piers 55 and 56, and for two dollars (each way) provides a twelve minute ride across the bay. At Sea Crest Park, the taxi's West Seattle terminus, guests will find Metro's Free DART shuttle which will take passengers to Alki Beach or West Seattle Junction. Seattle's first white settlers arrived on Alki Beach in 1851. They were helped through their first winter by the Duwamish people, led by Chief Seattle. The settlers named the area New York-Alki. Alki is a native word meaning by and by'', and the settlers chose the name to reflect their hope that the new settlement would grow to achieve the size and importance of New York City. After one winter camped on the beach, most of the party moved across Elliot Bay, to the less exposed shores of Seattle's current waterfront. Some of the area highlights include Alki Beach Park which provides 2.5 miles of sandy beach. This area has a great seawall for walking and people watching. The park runs from Duwamish head to Alki Point. The water is cold at the beach, but on a hot August day is well-populated and can't be beat. There is always something athletic going on in this neighborhood. Second only to Green Lake in Seattle, this area is known for athletics and outdoor fun. Also in the Alki Beach neighborhood is Salty's located at 1936 Harbor Ave SW. Salty's has become a northwest institution due to its spectacular view and romantic atmosphere. This is the only restaurant in the area with a view of the Seattle skyline from the SW side. Salty's is a favorite destination for couples and those celebrating special occasions.

"Ballard District","Washington","Ballard District - Seattle, Washington - Bringing the Heart of Scandinavia to the Northwest","Ballard is a vibrant neighborhood located in the northwest part of the city of Seattle, just north of Salmon Bay. Ballard is bounded to the north by Crown Hill, to the east by Phinney Ridge and Fremont, to the south by Lake Washington Ship Canal, and to the west by Puget Sound's Shilshole Bay. The neighborhood is notarized for its landmarks including Ballard Locks or Hiram M. Chittenden Locks, Golden Gardens Park, the Shilshole Bay Marina, and the Nordic Heritage Museum. Ballard is a must see for tourists and is full of locally owned boutique shops, pubs, restaurants, and waterfront parks. Each month the Ballard Chamber of Commerce sponsors the Second Saturday Artwalk, which brings in residents from all over the Seattle area as well as tourists. Ballard was first settled in 1853. In 1889 it was incorporated in Washington State and in 1907, Ballard was annexed to Seattle. Proud of its Scandinavian heritage, Ballard has many reminders of its past including the annualNorwegian Constitution Day Parade, the Nordic Heritage Museum, and the Bergen Place mural that was dedicated by the King & Queen of Norway in 1996. The Ballard Avenue Historic District reflects the patterns of industrial growth in Seattle, as well as the city's Scandinavian heritage. In the 1870s and 1880s, several distinct communities were formed in the Puget Sound area that centered on the area's rich timber resources. A group of Seattle real-estate developers purchased a large tract of land along Salmon Bay, and divided the property into commercial, residential and industrial lots. Industry was established in the new town named Ballard. J. Sinclair and Ballard's first mill was built in 1888. In the following year Michigan's prosperousStimsonCompany built its first mill in the region, which turned out to be fortunate timing, for the Great Seattle Fire that year created an immediate demand for supplies. By 1895, Ballard claimed to be the center of the world's largest shingle industry and, by 1904, was producing an incredible 3 million shingles per day. Many of the mill jobs were filled by Scandinavian immigrants, establishing an ethnic influence that remains today. The area's success spurred the construction of commercial buildings north of the shingle mills-two and three story Italianate brick banks, retail stores, saloons, and hotels-that form the core of the historic district today. Incorporated in 1890 with a population of 1,173, Ballard took just five years to grow into a bustling town of 10,000 that supported sizable foundry and fishing industries, in addition to the tremendous shingle industry. Ballard continues to be a unique Seattle neighborhood, retaining its late 19th-century flavor while adapting to changing times. Area transit and growth are issues that remain in the greater Seattle area, including Ballard. Sustainable Ballard, a non-profit organization has been established and continues explore challenges in the community regarding traffic reduction in the neighborhood. The Get Carbon Neutral transportation campaign is working toward Ballard becoming the first carbon neutral community in the nation."
"Bank of America Tower","Washington","Bank of America Tower - Seattle, Washington - Columbia Center Offers Amazing Observation Deck and Architecture","Seattle skyscraper fans frequently note this building as Seattle's most famous, to the general public it is somewhat less significant. Certainly the Smith Tower and Pike Place Market are more historically and culturally visible through postcards and tourist materials sent around the world. Still, the Columbia Center is worthy of a significant amount of praise. The architecture is based on the simple black glass block so popular in the 1970's and 1980's. But in this case, the simple form was made graceful and elegant through the use of three sweeping arcs of multiple elevations. The Columbia Center manages to break out of the monotony and stand out among the world's great towers. This would have been possible even if it had adhered to conventional design forms. Clocking in at a massive 997 feet, this is a building that demands attention. Still, its position in the skyline is unfortunate. In picture post cards it is frequently the tall kid in the back of the class on the right who doesn't get noticed as much as the one in the center like the Washington Mutual Tower. Although the tower is tall it doesn't receive the notoriety that the other skyscrapers do. It was the Federal Aviation Administration that first took the building down a notch, reducing its design height from 1,005 feet. Whether the eight foot reduction really makes a difference to pilots coming into SeaTac airport is a matter for speculation. The developers weren't going to lose any money on the deal by reducing the number of floors available for rent. They simply reduced the ceiling height on each floor by six inches. The fix is perhaps not the most elegant solution, but at least the most practical. The observation deck at the top of Columbia Center or Bank of America Tower offers a panoramic view from its 73rd floor. The view is not completely panoramic because the deck doesn't wrap around the building completely. It's best to call ahead as security concerns occasionally may close the observation deck. Admission rates are $5, $3 for seniors and students. The women's restroom on the 76th floor, with views of the Cascades, was named the second best restroom in the U.S. in 2005 by Cintas. There is a lot of discussion of the obscenity and obstruction of the skyscraper but the dispute has come to an end but in little or no agreement. Onlookers either believe the tower to add to the skyline or take away. The architecture remains unique and modern but can pose an eyesore if trying to photograph nearby design work."

Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. Although many new businesses have shadowed older ones, some venerated establishments still draw crowds of loyal patrons. Some of the classic, old Seattle nightspots in Belltown include The Rendezvous, Mama's Mexican Kitchen, The Lava Lounge, Ohana, The Crocodile Cafe, and Shorty's. Belltown also has an extraordinary array of restaurants, over one hundred in the zip code alone. Every kind of cuisine can be found here, and ranges from fine cuisine to hot dogs. Most restaurants offer an excellent happy hour for early evening patrons and on weekend evenings, the nightlife can be very vibrant. Belltown also happens to be a terrific place to stay put. In the last decade, the enclave has become a magnet for boutiques, sleek hotels, nightclubs, and, above all, restaurants.

"Chambers Bay Golf Course","Washington","Chambers Bay Golf Course, University Place, Washington - a Unique Golfing Experience at the ``Ends of the Earth''","Chambers Bay Golf Course has been described as a golf masterpiece'' and a truly unique experience at the ends of the earth'' in the state of Washington. The course, which opened in 2007, is a Robert Trent Jones II design, and a tribute to the historic links-style courses of Scotland and Ireland. The course features a breathtaking layout that overlooks Puget Sound and its coastal vistas, wind-carved dunes and fescue grasses. In the distance, the snow-capped peaks of the Olympic Mountains rise above the horizon, combining natural beauty with a championship-golfing experience. When designing the course, the Robert Trent Jones II design team made some decisions that contributed to the uniqueness of the course. They emphasized the course design over the clubhouse location, for example, pulling the clubhouse away from Puget Sound so that seven of the 18 holes touch the water or give that feeling. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a staggering 7,585 yards from the longest Teal'' tees, with a USGA rating of 76.9 and a slope rating of 135. Most golfers will choose something more manageable, with the White tees playing to a modest 6,011 yards. Chambers Bay is also a walking-only'' course, in keeping with the design team's goal of delivering the purest of golfing experiences. The result is a public links-style layout that will conjure up images of the St. Andrews Old Course and Royal Troon Golf Club where the game of golf was born. Like those courses, Chambers Bay features all the elements of a true links course: it's built along a major body of water, it has very few trees, if any, it resides on sandy soil, it features a natural, open layout where the landscape and weather factor into play, it has ground contours that provide remarkable undulations and slopes in both the fairways and greens, it has few internal water hazards, and it features seaside grasses. The course is located just outside of Tacoma, Washington, less than an hour's drive from Seattle. As a testament to the caliber of the course and its design, Chambers Bay is the host to the 2015 U.S. Open and 2010 U.S. Amateur Golf Championships. The course also received another accolade on August 14, 2007, when it became the first golf course in the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest to be certified as a Silver Signature Sanctuary by Audubon International. Such a certification is given only to new developments that meet Audubon International's demanding standards and environmental disciplines. And the staff of Chambers Bay is dedicated to protecting water quality, wildlife habitats on the property, and the environment in general. The 950 acres of land on which the course was built also has a rich history. The local quarry dates back to the Steilacoom Indian Tribe and the first European settlers in 1832. And the land encompassed in the Chambers Creek Properties has been used as a location for a paper mill, numerous lumber companies, a gravel mine, and a railroad center, to name a few. For those who wish to sightsee, the nearby Grandview Trail runs along the summit of a 200-foot bluff, offering sweeping view of the golf course, Puget Sound and local islands. Chambers Bay Golf Course offers a full array of instruction options, while the Chambers Bay Grill is a full-service restaurant and bar, featuring menu items ranging from fish-and-chips to prime rib. From the dining area, guests can gaze out upon Puget Sound, where whales sometimes crest the water's surface, or perhaps see eagles soaring above the Olympic Mountains - not unlike the ends of the earth.''"

During high tide a lot of the beach are disappears but there is plenty of space to relax during low tide. To get to the trail visitors must cross the busy street so it is important for parents with children to proceed with caution. Even the trek down to the beach is beautiful. Visitors walk through the cool green forest while the trees provide a canopy as a shield to the sun. The trail gives the visitor a feel of being far away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Bellingham. The trail is nothing more than a dirt trail and can become somewhat slippery during and right after a good Bellingham rain. The trail to the beach is almost 3/4 of a mile and is steep in places so proceeding with caution is important. Clayton Beach does not have picnic tables, restrooms or trash receptacles so people visiting want to make sure to be prepared with the necessary supplies. Once at the beach people can either relax on the sand or climb up the rocks and enjoy the breathtaking views of the Sound, Anacortes, and the San Juan Islands. Clayton Beach is the perfect spot to get away and enjoy the outdoors in a more private atmosphere. Many locals and visitors have found excitement rock climbing while others enjoy the peace and quiet and take the time to reflect on life while taking in the surrounding views. Walking trails and swimming are favorite activities of visitors. Due to the more primitive setting, 3/4 mile hike to get to the beach and lack of facilities it provides guests with a much more secluded and private experience. After visiting Clayton Beach many people enjoy exploring the rest of Larrabee State Park and also driving the historic and scenic Chuckanut Drive. Larrabee State Park is almost 2,700 acres of pristine forest. It has several camping spots and facilities. There are several hundred species of wildlife to be seen and great hiking and biking trails abound. Chuckanut Drive connects Bellingham and the Skagit Valley and provides a slower paced scenic drive as opposed to the hustle and bustle of Interstate 5. Getting to Clayton Beach is easy. Follow Chuckanut Drive from Fairhaven heading south. The parking lot for Clayton Beach is a short distance past the main entrance of Larrabee State Park. There are no fees required to enjoy Clayton Beach. The park is open seven days a week from 6 am until dusk."

"Columbia Park","Washington","Columbia Park - Kennewick, Washington - One of the Largest Parks in the Area Surrounded by the Columbia River","Columbia Park in Kennewick, Washington is a 400-acre park located between Highway 240 and the scenic Columbia River. There is nearly five miles of shoreline that allows for the popular park and all of its features. The park is hard to miss because of its size and certain features stand out more than others. Upon driving over the area's famous Blue Bridge, visitors will find themselves gazing upon boats traveling up and down the wide river. To the right, the docks and boat launches provide entry to the Columbia River. The park is home to the Playground of Dreams play area, a popular wooden castle-like playground that is truly a dream for kids. The Playground was torched several years ago by vandals but rebuilt even better to provide a great play area for children. In this area there is also a family fishing pond that is loaded with more ducks and geese than fish. Visitors can bring bags of old bread for the birds to eat, but beware; the ducks are well-fed and a little finicky. Next to the Playground of Dreams and at the east end of Columbia Park is the Aquatic Playground. Here visitors will find several boat launches, picnic shelters, barbeque facilities, and the J & S Express train ride. Most of the facilities are open seasonally. The area also provides the Bandshell, a stage area that is used for special events such as the annual Boat Races or concerts in the park. The 4th of July celebrations draw huge crowds as an extensive fireworks display takes place off of the barges parked in the river. Barges are situated at three various spots along the river, one display in Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland - the three adjacent cities known as Tri-Cities. An 18-hole privately run golf course is found in the area as well as batting practice cages. The Kiwanis Building is also in the area as well as ropes courses, a Frisbee disc golf course, and the Audubon Natural Area. There are ample trails for walking, biking, and rollerblading. Several smaller playgrounds throughout the park provide great places for kids to play and burn some energy. Large shade trees throughout the park and grassy areas make for optimal places to picnic and relax. A portion of the park, including the gazebo and Kiwanis Building can be rented for larger family gatherings or special events.

"Crescent Lake, Olympic National Park","Washington","Crescent Lake, Olympic National Park - Seattle, Washington - Large and Beautiful Lake with Name to Match its Shape","One of the most beautiful areas of the Olympic National Park is Lake Crescent. It is one of the national park system's most diverse national parks which contain snowcapped peaks, temperate rain forest, and windswept ocean coastal areas. The park is located along the Olympic Peninsula in the extreme northwest corner of Washington State and is surrounded by the Strait of Juan De Fuca on the north, the Pacific Ocean on the west, and the Puget Sound. Although it is only a short distance to Seattle across the Puget Sound, the park seems very remote as the population of Washington's Olympic peninsula is limited. The large lake lies in the extreme northern part of the park not far south of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and is 600 feet deep in places. The lake was formed by the action of Pleistocene glacier. This curved, deep, freshwater lake is surrounded by high mountains, including 4,534-foot Storm King Mountain. At ten miles long and 624 feet deep, the highly scenic lake is attractive to swimmers as well as anglers hoping to land their share of its plentiful trout. Due to its consistency, recreation at the lake includes fishing. Before heading out on a fishing excursion, consultation with local area guides and resources prove beneficial. Aside from fishing, boating is especially good in Lake Crescent. Visitors can rent paddleboats, rowboats, and canoes at the Log Cabin Resort. Visitors can get to Lake Crescent from U.S. Route 101, 17 miles west of Port Angeles. The park itself is very large and contains 922,000 acres. The area include 60 glaciers, 13 rivers, 57 miles of coastline, over 600 miles of trails, the greatest remaining true wilderness forest in America, and the largest herd of Roosevelt elk in the United States. The park includes three separate and diverse ecosystems-subalpine forest and wildflower-rich meadows, temperate rain forests, and the Pacific coastline. The Olympic peninsula has a long history of human habitation and use, dating back some 12 thousand years to a time when human beings fed on animals such as mastodons. Some nine Indian tribes made use of the area for fishing, hunting, and gathering food. The area provided ample resources such as sea food, berries, roots, elk, and deer for food, and the bark of cedar trees for robes, mats, and baskets. European explorers first became aware of the area in 1774 on a voyage by Spanish navigator Juan Perez. In 1788 sea captain John Meares sighted the park, and named its highest mountain, Mt. Olympus. Although the Spanish established a settlement near Neah Bay in 1791, the rugged topography and dense vegetation made the park area itself somewhat impenetrable and the mountains were not crossed until the James Christie expedition in 1889. Mt. Olympus itself was first climbed in 1907. Rich in history and beauty, the Crescent Lake offers wilderness at its finest preservation."

"Dalles Dam","Washington","Dalles Dam - Vancouver, Washington - Offers Fish Viewing Tours and Lots of Power","The Dalles Dam is one of eleven dams located along the Columbia River that the federal government built during the 1930s and the 1970s. It is a main stem river dam that operates as a system with no single dam standing on its own. Visitors of the dam can hop aboard an open-air train to view the Dalles Dam, which has been considered to be one of the longest dams located in the United States. The dam was also one of the largest hydroelectric projects undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Dalles Dam is used for navigation, flood control, and power production. The Dalles is from the French, La Grand Dalle de la Columbia, meaning flagstone, which is a reference to the basaltic rocks lining the narrows of the gorge. The original Dalles Dam was completed in 1957 and the half-mile long powerhouse unit now produces close to two million kilowatts of power. Salmon are seen in the area and Native American fishing platforms can be viewed along both sides of the river. There was a time when there was no public access to the dam due in part to the Homeland Security directives. Campsites along the edge of the river and nearby dam were also available and prevalent, but rampant drug use and invasion of the homeless lead to a crackdown by the Army Corps of Engineers. Tours are available when visiting the Dalles Dam. The brightly colored train allows visitors to view various parts of the dam and via closed circuit televisions allows onlookers to view live images of the fish. The fish ladder provides a great way to get up close and personal with the fish and their activities. Group tours and day tours are available. Tours provide information about the lifecycle of salmon and relevant information about the fish traveling in this vicinity. Reservations cannot be scheduled more than two weeks in advance. The tours are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or mothers with young children in strollers. When touring the facility, comfortable shoes and clothing are recommended. While visiting the Dalles Dam on vacation, the visitor center recommends looking around the area at nearby attractions. A nearby art gallery and sports stadium is not far away and various historic attractions like Fort Vancouver National Historic site is popular among visitors and locals alike. The city of Vancouver is the headquarters for Gifford Pinchot National Forest located near the dam. The Ulysses S. Grant house and museum and Covington House are also located nearby.

The average temperature in the summer season is 77 degrees, while the average high temperatures in the spring range from 50-60 degrees.

From author readings, book clubs, to publishing their own book newsletters, this bookstore covers every angle a booklover could imagine. The bookstore is an independent and family-owned store that was founded in 1973 by Walter Carr in the space that currently houses our children's section. In 1976, with the generous support of the Globe Building's owners and numerous friends, the store moved to the building in the corner and took residence on the current home site at 101 South Main Street. That space made up the store's first two rooms. In subsequent years the bookstore grew, room by room, to occupy the various nooks and crannies that are in existence today. The store is grand in appearance and boasts a large main floor, smaller multiple levels, and the constant sound of creaking wood as you walk along the wooden floor. The selection at the store is vast. Practically any topic can be found here, and the selection within each topic is extensive. Their choices would rival any of the major book chains. They also have sections of used and rare books, and offer a buy-back service to people wishing to sell their books. Store credit is their preferred method of payment, but cash can be paid for estate or library sales. The store also has a caf, on the lower level that not only serves a variety of tea and coffee, but more substantial items such as smoked salmon and a Moroccan steak sandwich. The caf, was founded in 1979 and recently underwent a major renovation. Tamara Murphy of Seattle's esteemed Brasa oversaw the re-do of the caf, space and menu. Sandwiches, soups, salads, specials, baked and other sweets, coffee, tea, wine and beer are all provided for one's culinary pleasure. Breakfast, lunch, light early dinners, and whatever falls in between, seven days a week are served here. Elliott Bay also has author events almost every day of the month. They host readings and discussions with patrons and are usually held in the evenings so the working crowd can participate. Along with the author events, the bookstore hosts a number of reading groups. They meet once a month on Tuesday evenings. The stores offers special order services, book club presentations, a fine selection of books on tape, signed first editions, magazines and journals, hand bound books, limited editions, and much more. A knowledgeable staff is on hand who do their best in meeting its patrons every need. Since the early 1970s, the store has strived to offer both breadth and depth in the books they carry in numerous sections throughout their store. If there are titles that they do not have, they will gladly try to special order them for its customers."

The museum struggled financially in its early years and as a result, Allen established theScience Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame (SFM), which opened in 2004 in the south wing of the EMP building. When SFM opened, EMP and SFM were treated as separate museums, and visitors had the option of purchasing admission to one museum, or, at a higher cost, a combined admission to both. In 2007, after mounting criticism, both museums ended the separate admissions policy and began charging a single admission price for entrance to both wings. The exterior of the building is quite unique. The outside of the building consists of stainless steel and painted aluminum shingles, each individually cut and shaped. The stainless steel has three finishes: mirrored purple, lightly brushed silver, and bead-blasted gold. The red and blue sections are painted aluminum. Each finish takes on an exciting and unique shade when viewed from different angles around the building. The red will fade with time, altering the appearance of the building's exterior and reflecting how music is ever changing. Upon entering the Experience Music Project visitors will be welcomed by a large tower of guitars. There is also an area full of computers that provide pod casts about many subjects by experienced artists. Visitors also have the opportunity of trying out musical instruments and even orchestrating their own private jam sessions in soundproof booths.

"Gas Works Park","Washington","Gas Works Park - Seattle, Washington - Industrial Archeology and Design in the form of a Park like Setting","Gas Works Park is on the site of an old gasification plant that once powered much of Seattle from 1907 to the mid 1950's. It was said that nothing would ever grow on this ground again due to the hydrocarbon contaminates, soot and petro chemical waste polluting the soil. The park has proved otherwise and now offers a great venue for Seattle residents to enjoy the outdoors. A massive soil cleaning effort was needed to create the park that now stands in its place. Portions of the original Gas Works remain, the largest remnant of the 1,400 such plants that existed in the US, and can be seen in the background. On the top of Gas Works hill is a giant 28 foot wide sundial created from concrete inlaid with cast bronze, shells, ceramics, art and other objects. This 20 acre point on Lake Union was cleared in 1906 to construct a plant to manufacture gas from coal - later converted to crude oil. Import of natural gas in the 1950's made the plant obsolete. The city acquired the site for a park in 1962. The park was opened to the public in 1975. The boiler house has been converted to a picnic shelter with tables, fire grills and an open area. The former exhauster-compressor building, now a children's play barn, features a maze of brightly painted machinery. Gas Works Park is a unique landmark for the City of Seattle. The original structures qualify as industrial archaeology and are the last remaining examples of a type of technology. These structures have been double served by Gas Works Park for not only have they been preserved but they have been integrated into an innovative, ground-breaking park design. The combination of a dramatic site and historic structures with the innovative park design has only increased the importance of Gas Works Park. The integrity of the original Gas Works is impressive. Although not all of the structures were saved, the character defining and prominent group of towers remains. The reuse of the pump house and boiler house has maintained building structure and much of the machinery. The site retains its original boundaries and lake frontage. Gas Works Park is the work of its designer, Richard Haag, a prominent Seattle landscape architect. Haag is the only person to twice receive the American Society of Landscape Architects Award for design excellence, one of the awards given for his design of Gas Works Park. Haag has received international acclaim for his design of Gas Works Park. Gas Works Park has a play area with a large play barn, and big hill popular for flying kites. Special park features include the sundial, and a beautiful view of Seattle. Burke-Gilman Trail runs past Gas Works parking lot and follows the Burlington-Northern Railroad 12.5 miles north to Kirkland Log Boom Park. There is a large parking lot 30 yards away with two handicapped parking spots. Gas Works Park has been a setting for films, such asSinglesand10 Things I Hate About You. It has been featured twice on the travel-based television reality showThe Amazing Race-once as the finish line forSeason 3and another time as the starting line for Season 10."
"Gold Mountain Golf Club, Olympic Course, Bremerton, Washington - a Highly Rated Golf Course in a True Alpine Environment","Washington","Gold Mountain Golf Club, Olympic Course, Bremerton, Washington - a Highly Rated Golf Course in a True Alpine Environment","The Gold Mountain Golf Club Olympic Course is set amid the majestic views of the Olympic mountain range and woods filled with fragrant pine trees. Or, in other words, it's golf in a true alpine environment. The course has been described as very playable and most players will drive the ball with confidence thanks to the wide, well-drained fairways that also allow for some nice roll. For a mountain course, Olympic does have some up-and-down movement to it, but not so much as to make it unwalkable. The real challenge on the course, however, comes from managing its small greens, which have been described as potato-chip shaped.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course, which is a John F. Harbottle, III design, plays to 7,104 yards from the longest (Gold) tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 135. The course features a number of noteworthy holes, including three signature holes.'' The first of the signature holes is No. 9, a par-5 that plays to a hefty 621 yards from the Gold tees and a respectable 562 from the Whites. Even with a good drive and second shot, players will find their toughest task lies ahead, as the green on this hole has been described as a killer.'' Back-to-back signature holes come at No. 15 and 16, which are joined by a lake, and are said to be the most picturesque holes on the course. No. 15 is a short par-4 that plays to only 357 yards from the longest tees. The hole doglegs left and the green is tucked behind water, making for some precise target golf. No. 16 is a par-3 that plays to 157 yards from the Blue tees, but calls for a carry over the lake. Players who can hit the green should have a good shot at birdie or par, but miss the green and it's been said that this hole will eat your lunch.'' Since its opening, the Olympic Course has received numerous accolades and awards. Golf Digest gave it a 41/2-Star Rating in its 2006 Best Places to Play edition, and also called it the 2nd Best Value in the United States behind Bethpage Black.'' Golfweek magazine ranked the Olympic Course the Best Public Course in Washington from 2002-2005, while GOLF Magazine put the course in its Top 100 You Can Play list in 2006. The course also plays host to many tournaments, including the NCAA Men's West Regional, the U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship and the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship. The Gold Mountain resort also features a clubhouse with a pro shop and dining at Tucker's Restaurant."
"Golden Gardens Park","Washington","Golden Gardens Park - Seattle, Washington - Park like Setting and Beachfront Location","Golden Gardens Park is a beachfront area located in the Ballard district of Seattle on the Puget Sound. The popular park offers extraordinary views of the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. A recent project restored two wetlands, established a short loop trail, and restored the northern beach area of the park. Golden Gardens offers strolls along a rugged coastline, hikes through forest trails, sunbathing on sandy beaches, fishing from a pier, and even a boat launch. The park is also home to an off-leash area for dogs in the upper northern portion of the park. Visitors are encouraged to keep an eye on their dog, but feel comfortable enough to let them loose to enjoy their freedom. The park was named after and developed by Harry W. Treat in 1907 as an area attraction at the end of the new electric car lines being built by realtors to induce townsfolk to take a Sunday outing out of town and through the woods to a picnic or swim location at a beach. The Carbine ended at Loyal Way with a steep twisting path down into the park and down to a small parking area on the east side of the railroad tracks, then by foot across the tracks to the beach. At that time the northern half of Meadow Point (named by the Coast Guard) was the site of a shipyard until 1913. To the south the beach curved in along the railroad seaway - all the way to Salmon Bay. The State owns the tidelands south of the park, with boat works and yards by the Bay. There is a remodeled Golden Gardens Bathhouse that offers a waterfront location to host special events, like weddings or receptions. The backdrop includes a serene forested hillside to the east, and to the west, a beautiful sandy beach, sailboats on Puget Sound, and the sun setting over the Olympic Mountains, all just 14 minutes from downtown Seattle. The historic Golden Gardens Bathhouse, located just west of the Ballard neighborhood, was built in the 1930s and renovated in 2004. Independent heating keeps the bathhouse warm in the winter, and cross ventilations keep it cool in the summer. The Main Hall comfortably accommodates up to 140 seated guests, ad can accommodate up to 295 for a standing room only event. The Main Hall features a cathedral ceiling with many skylights that flood the room with natural light. The Wet Classroom can be added to your rental for an additional hourly fee. Caterers often use this smaller room for food preparation. It features a refrigerator, microwave, sink, and lots of counter space. A small conference room can also be added for an additional hourly fee. There is ample parking throughout the park including a large parking lot along the beach and park area with an overflow parking lot east of the park. Plenty of handicapped spots are available as well and access to main thoroughfares is convenient."

"Green Lake","Washington","Green Lake - Seattle, Washington - A Great Place to Fish, but Hold Off on Swimming","Green Lake is a freshwater lake that is located in north central Seattle within the Green Lake Park. The Green Lake neighborhood district to the north and the east surrounds this park. The Wallingford neighborhood lies to the south and the Phinney Ridge district is found to the west. Green Lake is one of Seattle's most beloved and well-known parks. Its expanse of water and green space in the center of a dense urban neighborhood draws thousands of people daily from all over the city. When the weather is sunny and warm - a rarity in Seattle - the park is flooded with locals. Geologists say the Vashon Glacial Ice Sheet, which also formed Puget Sound and other area lakes, formed Green Lake some 50,000 years ago. Dredging of Green Lake has produced volcanic ash from an eruption of Glacier Peak that occurred about 6,700 years ago. The actual lake was included in the Olmsted Brothers' comprehensive parks plan, and was given to the City by the State of Washington in 1905. Green Lake underwent a series of changes over the preceding fifteen years - it was dredged and filled until it shrunk by nearly 100 acres! The last fill deposited in Green Lake was from the excavation of Aurora Avenue. In more recent times, Green Lake suffered from stagnation and pollution problems, as well as algae blooms. Milfoil and swimmers itch (caused by parasites from waterfowl) are still a consideration for those who swim in the lake to this day and swimming is not recommended. The reconstructed 2.8-mile path around the lake provides a perfect recreational spot for runners, bikers, skaters and walkers. The path includes a 5 1/2 feet crushed granite trail closest to the lake for walkers and joggers, and a 13 1/2 foot asphalt path for wheeled users and walkers. Many other park visitors use the athletic fields or frequent the park for boating, picnics and swimming. The park serves as a natural preserve for hundreds of species of trees and plants, as well as numerous birds and waterfowl. As a beacon for wildlife, Green Lake attracts various species of ducks, cormorants, loons, geese, turtles, rats, squirrels, raccoons, bats, eagles, and herons to name a few. There is an artificial island in the lake that was built by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. The island was constructed as a wildlife sanctuary and later housed a family of swan that was given to the city by Vancouver, British Columbia. Many species of fish also call Green Lake home. Rainbow trout are stocked for recreational fishing and there is a large population of common carp are present, and can be seen spawning in the shallows in spring. Tiger Musky fish were once stocked to control the carp population. The lake also contains largemouth bass, yellow perch, bluegill, yellow bullhead, channel catfish, and small populations of many different unexpected species. Green Lake is a popular fishing destination for outdoor enthusiasts from all over the state."

It is the nation's fifth oldest national park after Yellow Stone, Yosemite, General Grant and Sequoia.

"Hiram M. Chittenden Locks","Washington","Hiram M. Chittenden Locks - Seattle, Washington - Providing Links for Boats and Salmon between Saltwater and Freshwater","The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks are a complex of locks that provide a link for boats between the saltwater of the Puget Sound and the fresh water of the Ship Canal connecting to Lake Union and Lake Washington. To the area locals, they are commonly known as the Ballard Locks. The Locks, link salty Puget Sound with the fresh waters of Salmon Bay, Lake Union, Portage Bay and Lake Washington. The Locks serve three significant purposes. First of all, to move boats from the water level of the lakes to the water level of Puget Sound, and vice versa. Then, to prevent the mixing of seawater from the Sound with the fresh water of the lakes (also known as saltwater intrusion). Finally, to maintain the fresh water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union at approximately twenty feet above sea level. The complex includes two locks, a small (30 x 150 ft, 8.5 x 45.7 meters) and a large (80 x 825, 24.4 x 251.5 meters). The complex also includes a (235-foot, 71.6 meters) spillway with six (32 x 12-foot) gates to assist in water-level control. A fish ladder is created in the locks for the migration of fish, primarily salmon. The nearby grounds feature a visitor's center and the Carl S. English, Jr. Botanical Gardens. Both tourists and locals enjoy watching the parade of sailboats, motorboats, tugs, barges and yachts passing through the Locks. Visitors travel from all over the state to pass a sunny day watching boats of all shapes and sizes arrive into the locks. Upon arrival the water level is adjusted to allow their safe passage to the lake or Sound. The fish ladder was built to allow salmon to pass between fresh and salt water. Glass panels make it possible to view the fish as they navigate their way through the ladder, adjusting to different levels of salt each step of the way. Occasionally, a clever sea lion will hang out, waiting for his next meal. Although the viewing area is open year-round, the peak viewing time is during spawning season, from about the beginning of July through mid-August. The fish approaching the ladder smell the attraction water, recognizing the scent of Lake Washington and its tributaries. The salmon enter the ladder, and either jump over each of the 21 weirs or swim though tunnel-like openings. They exit the ladder into the fresh water of Salmon Bay. They continue following the waterway to the lake, river, or stream where they were born. Once there, the females lay eggs, which the males fertilize. Most salmon die shortly after spawning. There is also a public art work, commissioned by the Seattle Arts Commission that provides literary interpretation of the experience through recordings of Seattle poet Judith Roche's Salmon Suite, a sequence of five poems tied to the annual migratory sequence of the fish."

"Jimi Hendrix Grave","Washington","Jimi Hendrix Grave, Seattle, Washington: His Birthplace and Final Resting Place"," Jimi Hendrix had a tragically short life, but he changed the music industry with his innovative sounds and style. At the time of his death in London in 1970, he had released three albums, all of which did well on the charts in both the United States and England. He was only 28 years old. There has long been speculation about whether his death was an accidental drug overdose, suicide or something more sinister, but the official report lists his death as accidental. Even now, nearly 40 years after his death, Hendrix still has throngs of loyal fans. Each year, 14,000 of those fans make the journey to a suburb of Seattle, Washington to visit the grave and memorial site for Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix was born in Seattle on November 27, 1942. Very early in his life he showed an interest in music. His father, Al Hendrix, fed that interest by supplying him with whatever musical instruments he could afford. First it was an old ukulele with one string that he found. Next it was a second hand guitar and then, a few years later, an electric guitar . Hendrix was involved with a couple of bands before joining the U. S. Army. During his enlistment, he was a paratrooper, but had to be discharged due to an injury sustained during a jump . After leaving the military, he turned again to music. He performed as Jimmy James before releasing his first solo album using the name Jimi Hendrix. The album, titled Are You Experienced'', featured what would become some of his biggest hits. These include the songs Purple Haze'' and Foxy Lady'' . After his death, his father wanted his son to be buried near his birthplace so he secured what would become a Hendrix family plot in the Greenwood Memorial Park. The grave is located in Renton, Washington about 13 miles from Seattle. At first, it was a simple grave marker, but in 2002 a larger memorial was erected. The site includes a large dome that houses a life size image of Hendrix.  The memorial includes a total of 54 plots that will be the final resting of other members of the Hendrix family . The grave is a place for fans to visit and reflect of the short life and musical accomplishments of Jimi Hendrix."

"Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in Washington Highlights the Beauty of the Cascades","Washington","Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in Washington Highlights the Beauty of the Cascades","	So secluded that it is unreachable by automobile, the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, which sits amidst the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, is accessible only by passenger ferry and airplane. About 62,000 acres in size, this area has been carved by millions of years of glaciers, resulting in one of the most breathtaking landscapes in Washington State. The northernmost four miles of picturesque Lake Chelan are located inside the designated National Recreation Area. This is one of the deepest lakes in the United States, with an average depth of about 1,500 feet but a width of only about 2 miles from shore to shore. The park is home to the beautiful and remote Stehekin River Valley and the community of Stehekin, which lies at the upper end of the lake. Full of mountains, forests, fields of heather, and waterfalls, Stehekin has about 100 full time residents (though population grows in the summer) and is the ideal destination for a quiet getaway or a vacation full of invigorating outdoor activity. Hikers and bikers flock here in the summer, and skiers and snow-shoers are common sights during the winter months. Stehekin is so remote that the only phone service available until 2007 was via costly satellite and radio phones. However, that year, they joined the Washington State telephone grid. A visit to Stehekin should include a first stop at their very informative Golden West Visitors Center, staffed by National Park rangers who can help with trail maps and other important information. Several resorts or lodges do offer comfortable accommodations, but many of them are only open from spring through early fall. Visitors to Lake Chelan National Recreation Area have a number of choices to consider for outdoor amusement. Hiking is especially popular and hikers who head here have a large choice of trails and backcountry from which to choose. Accessible trails and scenic strolls are available for non-experienced hikers while trekkers looking for a real challenge can find options that include huge gains in elevation and plenty of rough terrain. In total, trails in the Stehekin/Upper Chelan Lake portion of the park number about 12, but those who wish to venture into the remainder of the North Cascades National Park will find another 30 or so designated trails.

It is an outdoor stadium that is home to the Washington State University Cougars, who have established their place in the Pacific-10 (Pac 10) Conference. The stadium was named after former Washington state governor Clarence Martin who served his term from 1933-1941. Martin was a former graduate of the college's in-state rival University of Washington in Seattle. The stadium was formerly known as Rogers Field and opened in 1972.

Since 1982, the Cougars had won six of the fourteen games played at the Apple Cup in Martin Stadium. The Apple Cup involves the rival Huskies team from University of Washington. The location of the stadium is great. Usually college stadiums are placed on the outskirts of the campus, but Martin Stadium is situated directly in the center of the college campus. There is an abundance of concessions offering inexpensive food and drinks and many restrooms scattered throughout the premises. Currently the seating capacity of Martin Stadium is roughly 40,000.

The stadium is outdoors and is open to all types of weather from rain, sleet, snow, and ice. The wind can be strong and it is important to dress for all types of weather. Students are die hard Cougar fans and when it comes to football it is difficult to keep them indoors. Visitors seem to have no problem bundling up and sitting in the cold for three plus hours.

"Mount Olympus","Washington","Mount Olympus - Olympic National Park, Washington - Variations of Weather Provide an Interesting Tour of the Highest Mountain in the Olympic Range","Mount Olympus is the highest mountain in the Olympic range and stands at a rugged and staggering 7,965 feet. The mountain is the first major peak that all Pacific storms encounter and as a result high accumulations of snow and extremely harsh weather occur here.  There is a significant amount of glacial formations, and in the continental United States only Mount Rainier and Mount Baker have more. Mount Olympus is located in the center of the Olympic National Park and requires a one day hike just to reach the base of the mountain, adding to its remote appeal. The climate in the region is influenced mostly by the mountains and the sea and there is a wide range of weather conditions. The mountain gets about twelve feet of rain every year along the west side and nearby valleys, which aids the growth of the temperate rainforest. Along the eastern side of the mountain is a rain shadow which receives only twenty-five inches of rain each year. This area is much drier than any other area on Mount Olympus. Summer months are warm yet fair, with temperatures fluctuating between 65 and 75 degrees. The driest months are August and September.  Winter months prove to be mild at lower mountain elevations, with temperatures in the 30's and lower 40's. Snow accumulation can be heavy at times with ten foot snowfalls and consequent drifts commonplace. Avalanche conditions are in effect most winter months and fluctuates daily and even hourly on the mountain. The Northwest Avalanche Center has been established to provide current avalanche information and it is recommended that a call in take place before venturing out skiing or snowshoeing. Due to the long winters on Mount Olympus, large glaciers are supported. The glaciers include Blue, Humes, Hoh, Jeffers, Hubert, and White. The largest glacier is Blue which expands over an area of 5.31 kilometers. Hoh is the longest glacier in the area and extends over three miles. Activities along the mountain are vast. Each year over 40,000 people enjoy camping in the Olympic National Park wilderness. Several hundred thousand hikers and trail walkers explore the region each year. Climbing Mount Olympus is a popular activity. Due to the mountain's triple peak and glaciated surface, there is a high appeal for mountain and ice climbing. The combination of the rainforest wilderness and mix of snow, rock, and ice make for an interesting climb. In good weather climbing conditions are spectacular but due to the heavily crevassed glaciers it is not recommended during severe winter months and storms. Weather is highly uncertain in the region and heavy fog can make it impossible to find the way back to the trail or camp. Climbing requirements include rope, an ice axe, crevasse rescue gear, and Crampons. A strong knowledge on how to use all equipment and crevasse rescue expertise is required. The mountain is accessible from Seattle by driving north toward Edmonds and taking the ferry to Kingston. Once across the Hood Canal Bridge along Highway 101, there are signs to the Hoh River Entrance to Olympic National Park, just south of the town of Forks. A one-way excursion from Seattle is approximately five hours."

The eruption was triggered by an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale causing the north face to collapse. Almost 230 square miles of forest was destroyed or covered in volcanic debris. A mushroom cloud measuring thousands of feet went up into the sky and covered much of the state in ash. It went from day to night within moments, and the eruption lasted over 9 hours. The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created in 1982 by the United States Congress for recreation, research and educational purposes. Within the monument the environment is left undisturbed so that it can respond naturally without interference. The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument is managed by the United States Forest Service. By the beginning of the summer of 1983 visitors to the monument were able to drive to Windy Ridge, which is only 4 miles from the crater. The spectacular view point overlooking Sprit Lake, people can see firsthand the volcanic devastation. Visitors today can now see the gradual recovery of the land and vegetation as life returns to the region. In December of 1986 a visitor center was completed at Silver Lake about 30 miles west of Mount St. Helens. In Just 3 years the visitor center had already attracted 1.5 million visitors. In 1993 an interpretation center had opened in the Coldwater Lake area with another one opening in 1997 in the Johnston area. The Johnston interpretive complex offers a view of the crater from the site of David Johnston's camp on the morning of the eruption. Within the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument there are a total of 5 visitor centers. The visitor center at Silver Lake located on Highway 504 shows a replay of the eruption and gives general information about volcanoes. The visitor center at Hoffstadt Bluffs is located at milepost 27 on Highway 504.

It can be completed by novice and advanced climbers. It is permitted to climb the mountain during any time of the year, but late spring through early fall is the most popular time. The majority of climbers use the Monitor Ridge Route that 4,500 ft. in 5 miles and ends at the crater 8,365 ft. up. This is a strenuous climb, but non-technical in nature. Most people complete the climb between 7-12 hours."

"Museum for Children to Explore Indoors and Out","Washington","Museum for Children to Explore Indoors and Out","The Hands on Children's Museum was first opened in 1987 and serves the Southwest Washington region as a topnotch source of hands-on art and science learning. The museum started out in a small storefront location until moving to its current setting on State's Capitol Campus. After only three years in existence the Hands On accommodated more young people per square foot than other similar facilities in the Washington region. The museum has grown so rapidly, due primarily to its programs and reputation as a class operation, that it's outgrown its facilities three times in the past ten years. Another major relocation is on the horizon in 2011 when the Hands On moves to its biggest and hopefully best location. Due to $9 million in Public Facility District funds the Hand On will be constructing a brand new permanent location on Olympia's downtown harbor area. The Hands On Children's Museum stimulates curiosity, creativity and learning through fun, interactive exhibits and programs for children, families and school groups. Hands On believes all children merit respect and a chance to be taught and that families are instrumental as the children's initial educators. The programs and participatory displays are intended to promote interaction and questions from the whole family. The museum stresses that learning occurs in a number of ways and experiential learning is crucial for maximizing brain development. Serving as an active partner with public schools, service clubs, public libraries, and other community organizations Hands On will bring quality, interactive education to the community. The Museum's Art and Science of Sandcastles exhibit uses quality, sanitary sand that the youngsters pack and sculpt in their personal works of art. Experience has shown that the kids benefit most from the hands on approach to learning and Improves fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Sand play also helps children develop cognitive and social skills. In the Backyard Wilderness area the children discover how their own yards can serve as home to local. The museum takes great pride in the care given to injured or orphaned animals in the Wildlife Rescue Center. Young guests get to climb and play in the Tree house while at the same time observing nature form up high or act out a wildlife play on the backyard stage complete with costumes and special effects. Kids of all ages can pick from an enormous collection of new and recycled art supplies to express ideas and craft their personal works of art while in the Gallery. The Hand On staff is eager to lead the art sessions and make sure the youngsters are having fun. The Gallery is specifically designed for children up to age four and their parents with stations equipped with arts and crafts to stimulate an early interest in the various forms of art. Until the new waterfront facility is opened in 2011 the management and staff of Hands On will continue to serve the Olympia community. The new, 27,000 sq. ft. Hands On location will allow the museum to serve an even greater number of families and continue to educate young people on the arts. The six major galleries with hundreds of exhibits will inspire the children and their families for years to come."

During the winter months only snow skiers and people in snow shoes can make the short trip. For a safe and beautiful view of Nooksack Falls there is a fenced area that begins at the road. The waterfall plunges almost 100 feet in three different segments and at its widest measures almost 30 feet across. It has been said that many people fell to their death from Nooksack Falls as a result of carelessly getting too close to the edge. The Nooksack Falls area is known for being picturesque with lush foliage and trees. It is a favorite spot for people to stop and watch birds and take nature photographs. Aerial views of Nooksack Falls have shown up on many postcards as professional and amateur photographers have taken the opportunity to capture some breathtaking pictures. There are several types of wildlife mammals, birds and fish that can be found in the Nooksack Falls area. During the late 1800's the Nooksack Falls region served as a hot bed of several minerals. The most significant discovery was the Lone Jack Claim of 1897 that yielded thousands of dollars of gold. The mine was closed in 1924 and ended up yielding a total of a half a million dollars in gold. As a result of the Lone Jack claim the area became known as the Mount Baker Mining District. Nooksack Falls is along the North Fork of the Nooksack River. The Nooksack River is comprised of the Middle Fork, North Fork and South Fork. The North Fork is considered the main part of the river. The Nooksack River is approximately 75 miles long. All of the forks originate in the Mount Baker wilderness. The North Fork flows generally to the west passing to the north of Mount Baker. The North Fork parallels State Route 542 also known as Mount Baker Highway. Nooksack Falls is formed as the North Fork of the Nooksack flows through a narrow valley. The kiosk in the parking lot nearby contains information about the falls and the hydroelectric project that was once there. The water from the Nooksack Falls once supplied hydroelectricity in the early 20th century. The plant operated for over 80 years before being shut down in 1997. After descending over the falls the North Fork waters flow west where it receives waters from Wells Creek, Glacier Creek and Canyon Creek. Due to the high rainfall amounts and deep snow packs of the area the river is subject to frequent flooding. Nooksack Falls was featured in the 1978 war drama film starring famous actor Robert De Niro about a trio of Russian steel worker friends and their service in the Vietnam War. The falls were featured in a hunting scene of the movie."

The museum was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to the heritage of Seattle's Nordic immigrants such as the Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish Americans. The museum serves as a community-gathering place and shares Nordic culture by exhibiting art and objects, preserving antique collections, and providing educational and cultural experiences. The Nordic Heritage Museum is in a 1907 red brick school building that was originally Daniel Webster Elementary School. Located in Ballard, the heart of Seattle's Scandinavian community, Webster School educated generations of Scandinavian and other immigrant children who came to this region, including many of our own volunteers. Webster School closed in 1979 due to a sharp decline in student enrollment throughout Seattle. The Nordic Heritage Museum opened in this building in 1980. On the first floor of the museum is the Dream of America exhibition. It is the story of immigration told in an exhibit of life-like dioramas. Visitors can travel with family back to the nineteenth-century Scandinavian countryside to begin the journey to America, starting with the move to the city. The voyage continues as you board a ship to make the Atlantic crossing, and land at Ellis Island. The adventure goes on to experiences in New York, and the expansion to the Midwest, Great Plains, and Pacific Northwest, ending in Ballard. Here the growth and development of a typical small Northwest community is displayed, complete with a post office, church, drug store, blacksmith shop, and a family home. On the second floor of the facility is the Promise of the Northwest, which includes two galleries that focus on the logging and fishing industries that employed many immigrants who brought skills learned in the old country. These galleries show the contributions of the Nordic pioneers to the settlement of the Pacific Northwest. The Heritage Rooms display treasured and useful items the immigrants brought with them, including folk costumes, textiles, tools, and furniture. Temporary art, history, and heritage exhibits are housed in the three galleries at the west end of the hall. The third floor exhibitions illustrate the differences and the common bonds among the Scandinavian people. There is one gallery for each of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. Each gallery highlights that group's special achievements in the Pacific Northwest. The entrance is on 68th Street between 30th and 32nd Avenues North West and the museum is accessible by Metro bus #17, which stops on 32nd Avenue.

Their intent was to create a park that would feature North American wildlife in its natural environment for people of all ages. Since finally opening in 1975, the Wildlife Park has grown into an educational center that includes a 436-acre natural habitat, several visitor centers, a lab and classroom area and frequent activities for visitors of all ages. The park has been visited by over 2 million people since its opening, and it continues to grow as the years go by. A day at the Northwest Trek Wildlife Park is an interactive adventure that includes a tram trip through the conservation area and activities in the various adventure and information centers located on the grounds. The park bills itself as a different kind of wildlife park'', and it lives up to its bill. Similar to African wildlife treks, visitors are transported through the 463-acre wildlife preserve on comfortable tram cars where they can watch the animals interacting with each other and with their environment in an open wildlife preserve. Visitors might see bison, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goats, as well as many other indigenous animals that make their home in the park. In addition to the tram tours, visitors can make their way along the Wildlife Park's walking tour through the forest area, where they might encounter otters, beavers, foxes, bears or any of dozens of species of animals. The Park also offers three marked nature trails; secluded trails that offer enthusiasts the opportunity to sight the insects, plants and wild birds that make their homes in the park's forest. Visiting the Wildlife Park is especially easy, thanks to the Train to Trek, which runs on selected dates throughout the summer. The day starts with an 8AM ride on a vintage train, taking visitors from Tacoma to the Northwest Trek Wildlife Park. Visitors are scheduled for a tram trip through the park, but have the rest of the day free to enjoy all of the exhibits and activities at their leisure. In addition to the wildlife park, trails, and exhibits, the Northwest Trek features activity and education centers for children and families. The Cheney Family Discovery Center offers interactive activities to be enjoyed by children of all ages and their parents or teachers. The Discovery Center includes a working honeybee hive and exhibits of Pacific giant salamanders, rubber boas, gopher snakes, and western toads. The Baker Research Cabin is a reproduction of an old trapper's cabin that allows visitors to get up close and personal, observing wolves, foxes and coyotes through remote cameras, binoculars and tunnels without interfering in their natural lives. The Northwest Trek Wildlife Park offers special events and tours throughout the year, many of them designed for school groups of various ages. It is open March 1 through January 1 each year, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. Hours vary with the season.

The museum pays homage to the Nutcracker and its ability to perfectly open the hard shell of a nut. The quest for man to quickly and easily open a nut has spawned these artistic pieces that attract people to the museum from all over the world. The earliest nutcrackers dae back 8000 years. The Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum boasts a bronze nutcracker that dates back to approximately 200 B.C. and was found in 1960. The museum has been visited by over 44 states and 38 countries. As unique as the town it resides in, the Nutcracker Museum offers video presentations, tours, and areas to shop. Owned and operated by Arlene Wagner, a former ballet teacher who produced the Nutcracker Ballet for many years, she and her husband George have traveled the world over to collect over 5,000 pieces displayed in their museum. The displays emphasize mostly antique nutcrackers, but also exhibit some of the designs from current makers. The Christian Steinbach Company of Germany is the largest producer of nutcrackers and a large line of their work is displayed at the museum. In fact, the most complete Steinbach collection in the world, resides here. Some of the other modern wooden toy nutcracker makers offered at the museum are Klaus Mertens, Franz Karl, Olaf Kolbe, Christian Ulbricht, Gunther Ulbricht, and more. The friendly staff at The Nutcracker Museum is proud of the impressive collection on display and they also help patrons to become educated on various nutcrackers so they can start a collection of their own. Patrons will learn about how much money it costs to start up a collection, and they also do appraisals for people that have nutcrackers. They provide people with a list of reputable deals and give tips on how to avoid getting scammed. They provide people with the best way to store, arrange, and display their nutcrackers in a safe and appealing way. The museum is open daily from May to October from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. and from November to April from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays only.

The gardens sit among lush greenery and towering cedar and fir trees. There are waterfalls and gazing pools scattered throughout the gardens. The average tour time of the Ohme Gardens is about an hour. There are stone benches throughout the area that provide opportunities to relax and gaze into the beauty of Washington State. In 1929 Herman Ohme and his wife purchased 40 acres of rough terrain with the dream of creating an orchard and natural habitat for friends and family to enjoy. Through a great deal of sweat labor that lasted over 40 years, the Ohme Gardens has been what it is today. In 1991, Washington Parks and Recreation purchased the gardens and the surrounding land and today it is managed by Chelan County. When exploring the gardens it is recommended that you wear good walking shoes and comfortable clothing. Some of the stone walkways and trails are uneven, steep and narrow. Wheelchair and stroller access is not permitted. There are numerous pools, cliff, water features, and irregular terrain, thus children are not allowed without close supervision of an adult.

"Olympic Coastal Strip","Washington","Olympic Coastal Strip, Washington - Clallam County, WA -Rugged Northwest Coast Offers Isolated Wilderness","Olympic Coastal Strip, Washington, is part of the Olympic National Park and is located 170 miles northwest of Seattle on the Pacific coast of the Olympic Peninsula. It is in the far northwest corner of the continental U.S. The strip stretches for 73 miles of rock along the sand and sea. It is one of the most rugged extensions of coastal land in the world. There are 3 points of access along the Strip thus making backpacking the only way to see all of its features from up close. The walk is often difficult. Some of the sea stacks visible along the Coastal Strip are so large they are topped with small patches of trees. Along the deserted stretches of beach enormous bones can be found, the remnants of long deceased specimens of the world's largest mammals. Living gray whales may also be seen along the hike, particularly during their migration season, which is December through May. Land animals, including bears may also be encountered and hikers carrying food must use bear canisters to store any goods that may emanate scents that attract these large and dangerous creatures. Olympic Coastal Strip, Washington, is also host to sea lions and a variety of birds including bald eagles. On hiking this trail one should be prepared for rain as the Pacific Northwestern US receives at least 100 inches of precipitation over the course of the calendar year. At the shore line tide pools fill with colorful bottom dwellers; at times as many as dozens of animals can be seen in just one of these temporary basins formed by the receding waves. All of this area and the islands off the coast are designated for protection by the U.S. Government. For those that are not backpacking large sections of the Coastal Strip, the 3 areas of access spread along its trajectory are at Kalaloch Mora and Lake Ozette. At southern Kalaloch there is a white, sandy beach. There are 2 campgrounds and a lodge here as well as a ranger station with several exhibits.  There is a short 1 mile looping trail here along the Coastal Strip and several beach trails. At this beach, where there are 2 sets of restrooms, it is common to see seals as well as otters. At Mora near the central part of the strip, (which is a 1 hour drive to the west of Port Angeles), there are campgrounds and a trail that leads two miles toRialto Beach along the Strip. There are restrooms and picnic tables at this rocky beach. Here the Dickey and Quillayute Rivers empty into the Pacific. Pets are allowed on this beach when leashed. Just north of this beach are memorials to two of the many wrecks that have occurred along the rocks off the coast of the Strip. The third access to the Olympic Coastal Strip, Washington, near its northernmost section, is at Lake Ozette, where there is a resort with cabins. While this is 3 miles inland there are 2 boardwalk trails from here leading to Sand Point and Cape Alava which are both on the Coast in the northern part of the Strip."
"Olympic Hot Springs","Washington","Olympic Hot Springs - Olympic National Park, Washington - Hot Spring Feature","Olympic Hot Springs are a feature at the Olympic National Park in Washington and located approximately one hour from Port Angeles and three and a half hours from Seattle. Visitors can find the springs by going south through the Elwha River Valley into the mountains and at the ranger station, take the right fork up Boulder Creek Road to the end of the road. Cars can be parked here and the rest of the journey is a two and a half mile hike up to the springs. The hot springs were discovered in 1892 by Andrew Jacobsen but were almost inaccessible for many years as there were no roads or trails there. In the early part of the 20th century William Everett acquired the rights to the location and built a trail to the springs until a road was built there in the 1930s. Everett and Harry Schoeffel then developed the area in to a resort, which became highly popular, but was closed in 1966 when the lease expired, leaving only the hot pools. Many visitors still enjoy the walks along the trail, which is nearby to the only walk in camp ground at the Olympic National Park. The trail follows the north side of Boulder Creek before crossing a stream. At this point the path reverses its direction 180 degrees and goes down the south bank to the hot springs, where several pools of warm water are located. There are seven natural hot springs in this particular area, but it is not certain what mechanism has triggered these, although many believe it is due to the fact they lie on a fault. With the breaks in the rock, this enables surface water to be heated and driven back from the hot interior of the earth. Their temperatures vary from 85 degrees to 105 degrees farenheit. Camping and fires are prohibited in the area near to the hot pools, but there are many options for visitors to take advantage of. The Olympic National Park has 16 National Park Service (NPS) operated campgrounds with a total of 910 sites. These can usually accommodate RVs and trailers up to 21 feet in length and provide a picnic table and fire pit, but do not have showers. The campground at Elwha is an ideal spot relatively close to the hot springs and is open all year round with 40 sites in the woodland area of the Elwha Valley. There is running water in the summer but not between November and March. However, visitors cannot take their bikes or pets on the trails, including the trail to the Olympic Hot Springs. From the trail to the hot springs walkers can also find Boulder Lake and Appleton Pass, which are three to five miles further on. Other attractions are within easy walking distance of Elwha including Madison Falls and the Nature Loop Trail, which are less than a mile away. There are further picnic areas at Madison Falls and tables near the Elwha Ranger Station."

"Olympic National Forest","Washington","Olympic National Forest","The Olympic National Forest is part of an emerald paradise. The Forest is located on the Olympic Peninsula in the northwest corner of Washington State (the Evergreen State). The Olympic Peninsula is a unique geographic province consisting of five major landscape settings: temperate rain forest, rugged mountain terrain, large lowland lakes, cascading rivers, and saltwater beaches. Here the flora and fauna provide interest beyond the imagination. Recreational opportunities seem unlimited in this region.   The Forest is situated within 35 air miles of Seattle's downtown and less than 120 miles via Interstate 5 or US Highway 101 routes. The area was established in 1897 and became the Olympic National Forest in 1907. The last boundary adjustment was made in 1987. The Forest spans across 633,677 acres and covers four counties. The landscape settings include temperate rain forests, mountain ranges, lowland lakes, cascading rivers, and saltwater beaches and tidelands. There are a number of threatened and endangered species seen in the Forest including the Northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, bull trout, Hood Canal summer chum salmon, and Puget Sound Chinook.

"Original Starbucks","Washington","Original Starbucks - Seattle, Washington - The Birthplace of the Original Starbucks Coffee Shop","In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there). The location was at the corner of Virginia and Pike Place, where this first-ever Starbucks was in business until January of 1977, when it moved to its current original store one block south. The current store in the Market is actually the sixth one, since there were stores in University Village, Capitol Hill, Edmonds, and Bellevue, along with the original-original, before the present Market Starbucks opened. And the stores in those days were quite different than now. They sold only coffee beans (roasted at first at Peet's in Berkeley) and coffee makers, not cups of coffee (and certainly not lattes), though they would pour you a free cup in the first year. The interior of the first Starbucks offers a long and white high-ceilinged room with glass cabinets along one side. The area is open to visitors who enjoy sipping some Sumatra or are just catching a glimpse of history. The fazade of the store retains its crude lettering and appearance per the historic codes of the neighborhood. The actual coffeehouse is along a strip of retail shops across the many food stalls, produce sellers, fish markets, restaurants, and the shops inside Pike Place Market. If you are a Starbucks connoisseur, you will want to stop by the birthplace of an icon. Seattle offers an array of cultural and historical venues, but the original Starbucks coffee destination is worth a visit. The appearance is not much different than some of the older Starbucks cafes but does offer an interesting taste in history and a piece of Seattle you will never forget."

"Pacific Science Center","Washington","Pacific Science Center - Seattle, Washington - Engaging Diverse Communities through Interactive Science and Technology","The Pacific Science Center is located at 200 Avenue North in Seattle, Washington within walking distance of the Space Needle. It is a non-profit foundation that serves over a million people each year, in every Washington state county. The mission of the center is to inspire a lifelong interest in science, math, and technology by providing an interactive and innovative exhibition and program display. Minoru Yamasaki, the architect of the New York World Trade Center, designed the complex. The walls of each building, composed of many pre-cast concrete slabs, form an arch motif used by Yamasaki in a number of buildings. The Science Center began as the United States Science Pavilion during the 1962 Seattle World's Fair. Millions came to explore the wonders of science during the World's Fair and upon closing ceremonies, the Science Pavilion was given new life as the private not-for-profit Pacific Science Center, becoming the first U.S. museum founded as a science and technology center. On October 22, 2012 Pacific Science Center will celebrate its 50th year anniversary. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and closed December 24th at 3 p.m. and all day December 25th.

Seattle skies do not provide the light necessary for tropical species to thrive. Supplemental heat, light, and humidity are provided to sustain a tropical ecosystem among the cool, gray, drizzly days of the Pacific Northwest. Approximately 500 tropical butterfly species are imported weekly from South and Central America, Africa, and Asia. The Willard Smith Planetarium engages its visitors in a welcoming, interactive learning environment where curiosity is embraced and ability to continue exploring is enhanced.

The Market has become a popular destination for both locals and tourists. Fish, fruit, produce and street food thrive at this destination and all summer long the locals grumble about the crowds while joining tourists as they drive through the middle of the market. Chain stores are not allowed, though Starbucks got its start here. There area few souvenir shops and a fair amount of overpriced wares being sold by street vendors. The market was established in 1907 for farmers and fisherman to sell direct to consumers. In the 1930's, over six hundred sellers worked in the market but up until 1974 the market declined until it was preserved as a historical district. Visitors will find no fast food establishments in the area, only fisherman, farmers, and craftspeople. The market is large and covers almost nine acres. The market closes in the late afternoon, so visitors are encouraged to get their shopping done early.

On summer afternoons the crowds can be overwhelming and driving can be difficult to navigate. There are alsorestaurantsand brew pubs that offer refreshments and dining pleasure. Directly across the street from the market is the first everStarbucks Coffee. Wear comfortable shoes, bring your digital camera, a shopping list if you're so inclined and come experience this one-of-a-kind Seattle tradition.

The workers entertain crowds upon crowds as they toss fish back and forth overhead. A true Seattle experience you will not want to miss. Cameras are recommended."
"Pioneer Square","Washington","Pioneer Square - Seattle, Washington - Historic District in the Heart of the City","Pioneer Square's historic district of Seattle, Washington offers numerous art galleries, bookstores, antique shops, casual and upscale restaurants, and nightclubs all within walking distance of most downtown Seattle hotels.

The area is located from East to West, between 2nd Ave and the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and from South to North, between Columbia St. and King St. Pioneer Square is between downtown proper to the North, and the sports stadiums and International District to the South. Although the name indicates otherwise, there is no square shape at Pioneer Square. Pioneer Square is the city's second oldest neighborhood. Many of the buildings in Pioneer Square date back to the 1890's but little of Seattle's early architecture survived the fire of 1889. The civic leaders of the day took advantage of the fire to raise the streets in Pioneer Square, solving a long standing drainage problem that the area once had. Visitors are able to catch a glimpse of old Seattle by taking the Underground Tour. The tour is a Seattle institution itself, and dates back to 1972. The area underwent a revival in the late 70's and early 80's when historic preservation became the city's priority. Pioneer Square was Seattle's first designated historic district and its vitality and survival remain prominent to this day. Other area highlights include Pioneer Place Park at the corner of James Street and 1st Avenue. Here there is the Seattle landmark of the iron pergola. Originally built to greet visitors to the 1909 World's Fair, the pergola welcomed the way and sheltered people waiting for the street car. The pergola was knocked over in 2001 by a wayward truck, but fully refurbished and restored in 2002. The park is also home to a Tlingit totem pole and behind the park is the Pioneer Building which is the headquarters of the Underground Tour. Occidental Park is situated among Pioneer Square along Occidental Street, between Washington and Main Streets. In the area are several totem poles, a history exhibit, and the Fallen Firefighters Memorial. In the summer, the Pioneer Square Community Association hosts free concerts on specific weekday afternoons. The patio outside the Grand Central Bakery is almost always busy during the day, and while the cobblestone street is lined with benches and trees, it is often unpopulated, except during scheduled events. Traveling to Pioneer Square from the downtown hotels is easy. The Square is part of the Seattle Metro ride free zone in which any bus traveling south from downtown will get you within a few blocks. Few parking lots are available at a fee, and limited street parking is also available. The best parking is considered the metered spaces under the viaduct - these parking spots are usually overlooked by all but the locals. Occidental Street, between 1st Avenue and 2nd Avenue is closed to cars between Washington Street and Jackson Street. The area forms a pedestrian mall aligned with galleries and shops."

"Quinault Rain Forest","Washington","Quinault Rain Forest, Olympic National Park - Seattle, Washington Temperate Rain Forest Located in the Great Northwest","The Quinault Rain Forest is one of four rich temperate rain forest canopies that lie within the western side of Washington's Olympic Mountains. The rain forest begins in the Mount Anderson drainage area and continues to the east and the Low Divide drainage to the northwest. The majestic forest follows the paths of the North and East Forks of the Quinault River. These forks meander down the valley and merge into one Quinault River, which enters beautiful Lake Quinault. The Quinault Rain Forest completely surrounds Lake Quinault and provides a scenic and beautiful destination. Moisture in the form of rain, drizzle and fog, and a valley open to southwesterly winds ensures the continuation of the life of a temperate rainforest. Rainfall in the area is measured by feet and not inches. There is an average of 10 to 15 feet, (120'' - 140'' up to 180'') of rainfall each year. Moisture is evident everywhere you look. Clouds, fog and forest growth help keep temperatures moderate summer and winter. This moisture and moderate temperature ensure plant growth and it is the rainfall that makes this area unique. Big Douglas firs, western red cedar and pacific silver fir dominate the main forest upper canopy. Adding to this rich dark green are the moisture dependent Sitka spruce and the western hemlock. The forest canopy is open, allowing streams of sunlight to reach the forest floor. These huge conifers along with the big leaf maple and alder along the river bars comprise first impressions for those visiting the Quinault Rain Forest. The Quinault Rain Forest is home to giant Douglas firs and several Roosevelt Elk herds. The elk are essential to the rain forest community. The elk stay year round in the Quinault Rain Forest, finding sufficient food and shelter. The herds live together in family units and travel to forage in familiar areas. They also travel from one river drainage to another. The elk herds play an integral part in the health and well being of the rain forest community. Also in the area are black bear, cougar, black-tailed deer, coyote, and many smaller mammals such as bobcat, beaver, river otter, raccoon, reside within the understory of the rain forest canopy. Their tracks are numerous, giving evidence of strong and growing populations. Bald eagle, golden eagle, osprey, hawk, blue heron, raven and crow are also visible in the area all along the river valley and at Lake Quinault. The eagles are abundant in the winter when there is a good salmon run. The eagles breed during the winter months. There are families of great Blue Heron that hunt along the pools and quiet river waters. Migratory Canadian geese, trumpeter swan, and a raft of smaller birds utilize the Quinault Rain Forest throughout the year. The Quinault Rain Forest is truly an enchanted valley'' that offers the visitor an awesome glance into the life of a temperate rain forest.

"Qwest Field","Washington","Qwest Field - Seattle, Washington - Home of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks","Qwest Field is home to the NFL's Seattle Seahawks as well as Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC. It has also been host to an annual Washington State Cougars home game, as well as concerts by musicians such as P. Diddy, the Rolling Stones, and Metallica. There are also talks of the NCAA wishing to hold future soccer Final Four games at Qwest Field. Breaking ground in April 2000 and opening in 2002, Qwest Field is owned by the Washington State Public Stadium Authority and is operated by First & Goal Inc. It is located right at the junction of I-5 and I-90, making it easily accessible to fans traveling by car. The naming rights of what was formerly known as Seahawks Stadium'' were awarded to Qwest Communications International Inc. in an agreement made in June 2004. Qwest paid $75 million to keep the name for 15 years. With a seating capacity of 67,000, the three-tiered venue offers an additional 5,000 seats for special events, and 1,400 seats for those with disabilities. Unique to Qwest Field is a roof covering 70% of the stands, providing the fans with extra protection from the sun and harsh weather. Qwest Field was designed with the idea of bringing fans closer to the game. Endzone seats are 40' away from the field, with fans in the sideline seats being only 52' from the action. The stadium also offers Red Zone'' suites, field-level boxes that are the first of their kind. On-site parking is offered, with 3,100 spaces available.

On the west side of the field is a pro shop to meet all the needs of even the most die-hard Seahawks fan. Qwest Field is easily one of the loudest fields in the NFL. Seahawks fans have been responsible for the false start of many opposing plays due to the stadiums unique design, which pushes as much crowd noise onto the field as possible. In recognition of this, and to encourage fans to make as much noise as possible, the Seahawks have kept track of the number of false starts made by opposing teams. In another act of fan appreciation, the Seahawks have posted a large flagpole in the south end zone which flies a blue flag with a number 12''. This represents the 12th man'', referring to the fans as a member of the team. In honor of this, the Seahawks have even gone as far as to retire the number 12 from their roster. The horseshoe shaped stadium's playing surface is FieldTurf. While easier to maintain than a natural grass field, this synthetic playing surface doesn't comply with FIFA regulations. In order to bring the field to code, First & Goal Inc. has agreed to pay for a natural grass field's installation in order to meet the FIFA standards."

"Ruby Beach, Olympic National Park - One of the Most Diverse Park's in the Nation Full of Scenery and Fog","Washington","Ruby Beach, Olympic National Park - One of the Most Diverse Park's in the Nation Full of Scenery and Fog","Along the Olympic Peninsula of the state of Washington lies Ruby Beach.  This area is named for the rose-colored ruby gemstone fragments found in the coarse grey sand. As part of the Olympic National Park, the often foggy shoreline boasts a backdrop of mountains, glaciers, rain forests, and lots of wilderness and is one of the most diverse parks in the entire nation. Ruby Beach is located along the southwest coastal portion of the Olympic Park and is accessible directly off Highway 101. Although the area is called a beach, it is in no way fit for sun, surf, or outdoor sports. Swimming in this location is not allowed or desired. There are piles of bleached driftwood that have been carried on the shore by storms and waves and assemble a shore lined with pick-up sticks. The forests located up river periodically become flooded which cause trees to fall, and deliver the fallen debris and trees into the ocean. There is an overflow of tidal pools along the rocky shoreline where visitors can examine numerous marine creatures struggling to survive in the ebb and flow of the tides. Offshore rocks jet out of the water with their tops covered with the barest vegetation. Here you will find birds galore. Ruby Beach is located off the beaten track and as a result, the crowds are never huge. If visitors are looking for a quiet place to explore, this beach is the place. While wandering along the shoreline, explorers may come upon cliff caves that are open for discovery. The caves and rock formations or yesteryear are the backdrop for the rugged and rigid coastline. Today, large nesting colonies of birds, such as murres and tufted puffins make their dwellings in the rocks. Aside from swimming, there are so many activities to choose from in and around the park. Visitors could explore for two weeks straight and not discover all that can be investigated among Washington's Olympic Peninsula. Although, all of the eco-zones within the park can easily be experienced in just one day. From the coast, visitors can ascend nearly a mile high to Hurricane Ridge, which offers a visitor center and nature trails. From Hurricane Ridge, a three-hour drive to the west will bring you to the Hoh Rain Forest, which also has a visitor center, picnic area, and short nature trails leading through the tropical forest. Sunset at Ruby Beach is extraordinary as the entire sky lights up and reflects off the garnet fragments in the sand. Photographers and tourists gaze for hours collecting the perfect shot. When the lowering sun glints off the crushed garnets the sand is turned to a magnificent shade of rose. The area is known to be the place for romance. The backdrop of ember hues makes the entire sky reflect a fire tone that is unable to be duplicated. Nature at its finest dimension is found in this location."

The airport currently serves a variety of domestic and international destinations. Canadian and Pan-Asian flights figure heavily on the rotation. The airport is working to get more non-stop flights between Seattle and Chinese destinations like Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. There are low cost carriers at the airport, although the rising costs of flying in and out of Sea-Tac have caused friction in recent years. Southwest has repeatedly expressed interest in moving, but as of yet has not actually done so as a result of costs. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is also in the middle of adding a link rail connection. Currently, the airport is served by bus line and car service only. Several main highways lead to the airport, and the loading and unloading areas see heavy traffic. Coupled with the overall high traffic in the Seattle area, this can lead to considerable congestion in peak travel times. Starting in 2009, there will be an Airport Station stop on the Sound Transit Central Link light rail line. The line will service downtown Seattle and offer connections to the surrounding area."

"Shi Shi Beach","Washington","Shi Shi Beach, Olympic National Park - One of the Most Beautiful Seascapes and Beaches in the Nation, with Trails that Abound","Shi Shi Beach is truly one of the most scenic spots along the Washington coast and is known as one of the best beaches in the nation for numerous reasons. Shi Shi has approximately two miles of walking beach to explore and while doing so it is difficult to keep your eyes from wandering. Whether it is the seascape in front of your eyes or the sand and tide pools, Shi Shi is not a location visitors will want to explore lightly. The sea stacks and beach caves with jetting tide pools, both shallow and deep, allow for great times of exploration. Taking in the sunset at the beach is amazing, but at Shi Shi the memory will be embedded for years to come. Here the sky lights up and reflects off the Pacific Ocean and glistening sand. Capturing the sunset on film is necessary in keeping the landscape alive even after you leave this amazing beach. The Northern entrance to Shi Shi is located on the Makah Reservation. From Port Angeles, travelers can drive west on U.S. 101 to Highway 112. Turn right onto Highway 112 and drive north to Neah Bay. At the west end of town, turn left onto Cape Flattery Road and drive 3 miles to Hobuck Beach Road. Turn left, cross the Watch River, and drive to Sooes River. Hobuck Beach Road eventually turns into Sooes Beach Road. Cross the Sooes River and drive to the trailhead on the right. This is the easiest route to get to the beach. Landowners near the trailhead allow visitors to park on their property for a small fee. This is advisable as parking at the trailhead is for day use only. Vandalism is a known problem in the area, so it is recommended that you park your vehicle at these locations. It is also advised that you drop your packs at the trailhead and have at least one person guard your gear, while another team member drives back to the last house to park and pay. From the trailhead, it is an easy two mile hike to the beach. The trail is fairly flat, except for the last bit down to the beach. The trail can be extremely muddy at times so proper attire is recommended. Pets are prohibited on the beach, even on leashes. Three pit toilets are available to visitors, one at the north end, near Bear Petroleum Creek, and one near Willoughby Creek. Water sources are also available at Petroleum Creek and Willoughby Creek. Most of the coastal water source facilities have a dark stained appearance from the tannin leached from leaves. Visitors are encouraged to boil, filter, and treat all water sources as girardia is known to exist in most of the coastal streams. In order to protect the area from coastal fires, campfires can only be built on the beach with driftwood. Due to raccoon problems, all food garbage and scented items must be secured in hard-sided containers such as Bear canisters. Wilderness camping permits are required for overnight hikes and can be obtained at the Wilderness Information Center (WIC) in the city of Port Angeles."

"Smith Tower","Washington","Smith Tower - Seattle, Washington - The Oldest Skyscraper in the City and Designated Landmark","The Smith Tower is located in Pioneer Square and noted as the oldest skyscraper in Seattle, Washington. Completed in 1914, the tower is named after its builder, firearm and typewriter magnateLyman Cornelius Smith. Containing 42 floors, it was the tallest office building west of the Mississippi River until theKansas City Power & Light Buildingwas built in 1931. It remained the tallest building on the West Coast until the Space Needleovertook it in 1962. The building is a designated landmark in the greater Seattle area. The Smith Tower is a great example ofneoclassical architecture. Its outer skin is made of granite on the first and second floors, and terra cotta on the rest. It has been washed only once since its construction, in 1976, because it remains remarkably clean without regular washing. The building is the last on the West Coast to have live elevator operators. TheOtis Elevator Companyprovided the elevators, which have uniquely designed brass surfaces. The doors are latticed, so a rider can see into each hallway and through the glass walls in front of each office. The Chinese Room is on the 35th floor of the tower, the same level as the observatory. The furniture and the hand carved ceiling were gifts from theEmpressofChina. They include the famous Wishing Chair. It is said that a single woman who sits in the chair will marry within a year. The legend came true for Smith's daughter, who married in the Chinese Room itself. After the restoration in the early nineties, workers removed a thousand-gallon water tank in the very top of the tower. This resulted in much new space, and what was formerly a small maintenance man's apartment became a three-story penthouse, the only residence in the building. The very top of the building is crowned by an eight-foot wide glass dome which is illuminated by blue light, except for the month of December, when it is changed to green. The 37th floor originally contained a caretaker's apartment. Above was a multi-story, 10,000-gallon, cast iron water tank. The water tank was disassembled by welders who cut it into pieces small enough to fit into the elevator. Then the entire space was remade into a penthouse apartment. It is the only residence in the building and contains a massive Dale Chihuly chandelier. The Smith Tower has survived three earthquakes of a magnitude of 6.0 or greater: 2001, 1965, and 1949. The ground under the Smith Tower was never part of the tidal mud flats that underlie much of Pioneer Square. Core samples down to 122 feet below 2nd Avenue reveal fallen trees, some as large as 3 feet in diameter, which have never been exposed to seawater. The Smith Tower is just eight blocks south of the Pike Place Market in the Ride Free zone. No fare is required if you board and exit a bus within the downtown area.

"Snoqualmie Summit Ski Area","Washington","Snoqualmie Summit Ski Area - Seattle, Washington - Northwest Tradition of Skiing, Snowboarding, and Outdoor Winter Fun","The Northwest tradition of skiingon Snoqualmie Pass began in the 1920's and 1930's, pre-dating the 1937 opening of the Snoqualmie Summit Ski Area. The earliest skiers were a hardy group of world-class ski jumpers who hiked up hills and competed on a jump built by the Seattle Ski Club, near Beaver Lake Hill. Interest in the sport by both jumpers and spectators grew rapidly, and in 1933 the Seattle Parks Department applied for a permit from the United States Forest Service to establish a ski hill at Snoqualmie Pass. Accessed seven days and six nights a week by the Central Express high speed quad, the commitment continues year-round with large dirt-work projects in the summer (to allow more features earlier in the season) and the addition of more and more jibs to the fleet (over 60 total this season). Central Park at Summit Central continues to lead the Greater North West with its changing, creative and flat-out-fun layouts. Central Park includes the area's only Zaugg-cut Superpipe, park-specific snowmaking, and tunes blasting all day and night to make your trip to The Summit each season the best yet. West 52nd is a great small to medium park built and maintained from the opening of the season through President's Day. Operating Fridays from 4 pm-10 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 9 am to close, its boxes, rails and snow features change throughout the season. Greenhorn Acres is a great place to start your terrain park experience on small, confidence-building features. Small rollers, jumps and banked turns as well as small rails and boxes are waiting for you in a comfortable learning environment.

"Walla Walla Wineries","Washington","Walla Walla Wineries - Walla Walla, Washington - The New Napa Valley of the Northwest","The Walla Walla valley is filled with world class wines and is becoming known as the new Napa Valley. This region of wineries is one of the most remote in all of Washington State nestled among the Walla Walla valley approximately five hours from Seattle located on the western side of the state. The Walla Walla wineries lie in both Washington and Oregon due to the proximity of the state line border. The winery region expands from the far southeast corner of Washington State to the northeaster tip of Oregon. When it comes to Merlots and Cabernet Sauvignons, the Walla Walla wineries are setting the standard for Northwest winemaking. Geologists in the area have determined that approximately 15,000 years ago there were periodic failures of giant sized ice dams that caused glacier outbursts approximately every 35 to 55 years. As a result, large volumes of water escaped from behind the dams and burst through, creating channels and pot holes in the landscape. Immense flooding occurred and is documented as some of the largest floods in geological history. When the water resided, ponds of water remained and fine slack water sediments were left behind. This process set the stage for some of the most optimal winegrowing regions in the northwest if not the entire United States. The wineries of Walla Walla continue to grow in number. In 1999, there were 800 vineyard acres and by 2001, the acreage had increased to 1,200. Today there are nearly 100 wineries that call Walla Walla Valley Appellation their home. 	Walking down the eclectic and unique Main Street of Walla Walla, visitors will see at least one winery nestled into shops on every block. Venture out of the city just a few miles and visitors will find a winery scattered among wheat field every mile or so. One of the most popular Walla Walla area winery is L'Ecole No. 41, located at 41 Lowden School Road, approximately 15 minutes from Walla Walla along Highway 12. L'Ecole is French for the word school, and the winery began production in 1983 in the basement of an old 1915 schoolhouse. The winery's expansion over the years has been great, and today produces 35,000 cases annually. The winery is open to the public for touring and wine tasting seven days a week, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and closed on all major holidays. L'Ecole produces Semillon, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Apogee & Perigee (red wine blends), Luminesce (white wine blends), and late harvest Semillon; all wines that grow optimally in the Walla Walla winery region. The region caters to the wine tour circuit. As a result, visitors will find ample lodging and wine bars scattered throughout the Walla Walla region. Some of the area's wine bars and wine shops include The Bar @ 26brix located on Main Street, Vintage Cellars Wine Bar located on North Second Street, The Vineyard Lounge found at the Marcus Whitman Hotel on West Rose Street, and the Walla Walla Wine Depot found on Second Street."

"Washington State Convention and Trade Center - Seattle, Washington Seattle's Convention Center in Prime Location","Washington","Washington State Convention and Trade Center - Seattle, Washington Seattle's Convention Center in Prime Location","The Washington State Convention and Trade Center or WSCTC is conveniently located in the heart of downtownSeattle, with on-site parking, business services and eateries. The Center is within easy walking distance of the city's best shops, sights, hotels and restaurants. In the early 1980s, a group of community leaders from the public and private sectors conceived the notion of building a convention center in Seattle to foster new economic development. In 1982, with support of the state Legislature, a public non-profit corporation was established to acquire land and to design, construct, promote and operate the Washington State Convention & Trade Center. A site adjacent to, and over Interstate 5 was selected and initial construction began in the fall of 1985, and continued for nearly three years. The Center's first scheduled event took place on June 18, 1988. The Convention Center, throughout its history, has exceeded the mandate of the Legislature to provide economic and civic benefits for the people of the state of Washington. These benefits have included a commitment to the building and renovation of affordable housing, historic preservation of significant structures and acquiring an extensive collection of public art. WSCTC offers the option of working with a single point of contact to plan the specifics of any event. An Event Coordinator will review the Meeting Planner Checklist as you assemble your event information. Together you will plan telecommunications and technical requirements, lighting, plumbing and more. And WSCTC offers superior food and beverage services, from light breakfast snacks to reception, full-service meals. The Convention Center operates two covered parking garages that adjoin each other and the Convention Center. The two parking garages can accommodate approximately 1,565 vehicles. Unlike most downtown parking garages located in the retail and theater district, Convention Center parking is located in close proximity to two I-5 exits and is accessible from the eastside of the freeway. The Convention Center recently installed a new parking system that has dramatically improved the speed of exiting the parking garages. The new central cashier and stand alone express payment machines give customer's the choice of friendly outstanding customer service from our cashiers or, the quick transaction speed of the stand alone express payment machines. Payment machines and cashier's accept major credit cards and cash. The Convention Center is one of the few parking garages that do not charge higher event rates for big events. The Convention Center daily rates are consistently on the low side of rate surveys of surrounding parking garages. Shoppers and A Contemporary Theatre (ACT) patrons, have easy covered access. ACT and the parking garages are connected, there is no need to go out in the weather or wait at street lights. Shoppers can also go from the Convention Center through a walkway that goes to 4th Avenue's Rainer Tower, without stopping for traffic lights. This route is lined with retail shops."
"Washington State Ferries","Washington","Washington State Ferries - Seattle, Washington - One of the Largest Fleets in the World","The Washington State Ferries are owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation and serve the communities of Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands. The ferry system is one of the largest fleets of passenger and automobile ferries in the United States and ranked among the top five largest in the world. There are twenty-eight ferries that cross Puget Sound and its inland waterways, carrying over 26million passengers to 20different ports of call. From Tacoma, Washington, to Sidney, British Columbia, the ferries travel up and down the Sound, acting as a marine highway for commercial users, tourists, and daily commuters alike. In 1951 Washington State Ferries evolved with the state's buyout of Puget Sound Navigation. Ferry service around Puget Sound has changed tremendously over the course of the last century. Upon origination, Washington State recognized that the ferries were a lifeline for many communities and there was a need for reliable ferry service to meet growing demand. In 1951, after numerous discussions with the State Legislature over fares and service, the Puget Sound Navigation Company sold all of its terminal facilities and ferries for a meager $5 Million to a newly created Washington Toll Bridge Authority, now known as Washington State Ferries (WSF). The ferry system was originally intended to provide temporary service until a network of bridges could be built connecting the west and east sides of Puget Sound. However, in 1959, the legislature rejected the plan to build numerous cross sound bridges. At that time, the responsibility for managing the ferry system was shared by the Toll Bridge Authority and the State Highway Commission. WSF is the largest ferry system in the United States, serving eight counties within Washington and the Province of British Columbia in Canada. Counties served include Pierce, King, Snohomish, Kitsap, Skagit, Island, San Juan, and Jefferson Counties. WSF's existing system has 10 routes and 20 terminals that are served by 28 vessels. In fiscal year 1999, WSF carried over 11 million vehicles and 26 million people - over one million more walk-on and vehicle passengers and 500,000 more vehicles and drivers than in fiscal year 1997. In the fleet, the Captain (or Master) oversees the entire ship's operation from the pilothouse, which is the communications and navigation center of the ship. The Chief Mate assists the Captain with the operation of the vessel, often including loading and unloading operations. Except when docking or in tight quarters, the steering of the ship is generally left to the quartermaster who follows the directions of the bridge officer. Able-bodied Seamenand Ordinary Seamenwork as deckhands, directing vehicles, and securing lines when the ship docks, acting as lookouts, patrolling the vessel for safety hazards, and cleaning the vessel. The Chief Engineer oversees repairs and maintenance to the vessel's mechanical and electrical equipment. This position also supervises the engine room and control center located beneath the car deck. The Chief Engineer and the Assistant Engineer also monitor all the control systems and in some cases, control the speed and direction of the vessel, following the Captain's commands. The Oiler assists the Engineers by circulating through all the machinery spaces, ensuring that everything is operating correctly. Today there are over 1800faithful employees who have made Washington State Ferries the most popular tourist attraction in the State."

"Whatcom Falls Park","Washington","Whatcom Falls Park - Bellingham, Washington - Picturesque Park with Waterfalls and Fishing Hatchery","In the 1890's, the area now known as Whatcom Falls Park was called the Picnic Ground because of its popularity with locals who went there to bike, walk and picnic. The private landowners wanted to sell the land and locals clamored for it to be purchased to be used as a park. During this era cities did not have funds for parks so the Young Men's Commercial Club raised $12,000 to purchase the original 40 acres. The rest of the current 241 acres were purchased by federal money in the 1930's. On June 10, 1999 the park was devastated by fire. A pipeline burst and over 200,000 gallons of gasoline were spilled into Hannah and Whatcom creeks. Bellingham, Washington is known for its plethora of beautiful parks. Whatcom Falls Park is no exception to this rule and many locals and visitors believe it sets the standards by which all other Bellingham parks are measured by because of its beauty, utility and location. Whatcom Falls Park totals 241 scenic acres located at 1401 Electric Avenue in Bellingham. From the parking area the water from the falls can be heard and a paved path leads to an impressive sandstone bridge built in 1939 by the Roosevelt sponsored Works Progress Administration. Park areas near the creek are surrounded by tons of trees and shrubs. Once past the bridge the park's trails and paths become gravel and dirt that lead to other sections of the park. This section of the park also allows for pets to be off of their leashes so they can be free to roam around and sniff out the entire area. This section of the park is known by locals as The Whirlpool'' where swimmers can jump off of a 60 foot cliff into the waters below. The area is not supervised so swimmers must jump at their own risk. The jump is enjoyed by thousands of thrill seekers every summer without incident. Once inside Whatcom Falls Park visitors understand that that it is more than just a beautiful park with waterfalls. The eastern part of the park contains fields, tennis courts, and even a fish hatchery. There are large picnic areas with covered areas for people to enjoy dining outdoors in the shade. Groups can reserve the spaces by calling the local Parks and Recreation Office. Also available are outdoor basketball courts, and plenty of restrooms. Also available is a small fishing pond for children 12 years and under. This is a great place for youngsters to learn the joy of fishing and develop their skills.

"Whitman Mission","Washington","Whitman Mission - Walla Walla, Washington - National Historic Site Where the Whitman Massacre Took Place","The Whitman Mission is a national historic site where the 1847 Whitman Massacre took place. The Whitman's were a small group of Protestant missionaries that in 1846 traveled into Oregon County. Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Spalding were of the first white women to complete this journey. Differences in culture led to significant tensions between the Cayuse and the Whitman's. The following year a measles epidemic outbreak took place and the Cayuse blamed Dr. Whitman for the deaths among their people. Dr. and Mrs. Whitman were killed and some sixty others were taken hostage. The deaths of the Whitman's caused horror among the country and prompted the Congress to make Oregon a U.S. Territory.

"Woodland Park Zoo","Washington","Woodland Park Zoo - Seattle, Washington - mid-size public zoo on 92 acres","Originally opened as a private zoo in 1887, Woodland Park Zoo began life as a menagerie created by a wealthy Seattle resident who generously shared his collection with the public. Guy C. Phinney, real estate developer and owner of a lumber mill, collected the animals in his menagerie as part of a 342-acre estate that also included a promenade, a mansion and a hunting lodge. The menagerie, which would eventually become the Woodland Park Zoo, was home to black bears and deer, as well as more exotic animals like African ostriches. After Phinney's death, the city of Seattle purchased Woodland Park for $100,000 over the objections of the Mayor and some members of the city council. Over the next 30 years, Woodland Park Zoo began to take shape. By 1930, the Woodland Park Zoo housed elephants, lions and tigers and bears, and many other animals. It also featured its own trolley run and a carousel and Ferris wheel. Visitors to the zoo could enjoy camel rides, visit apes and chimpanzees in the Primate House and stroll through a formal Rose Garden, which is still in existence and widely regarded as one of the finest in the nation. Today, 110 years after Phinny opened his menagerie to the public, the Woodland Park Zoo exhibits 1090 animals from 300 different species. Each animal is housed in a bioclimatic zones, ecologically sound habitats that replicate the natural environment of that animal.
