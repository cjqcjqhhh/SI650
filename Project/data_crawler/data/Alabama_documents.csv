"16th Street Baptist Church","Alabama","16th Street Baptist Church - Birmingham, Alabama - Historic Church","16th Street Baptist Church is located on Sixth Avenue North in Birmingham, Alabama and is approximately a seven minute drive from Birmingham Airport. The church campus is open for tours 10am to 4pm Tuesday to Friday and 10am to 1pm by appointment only on Saturdays. It is a largely African American Baptist Church that was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2006 and is still in operation now with regular services held here. This was the first black church to organize in Birmingham with meetings initially held in a small building at 12th Street and Fourth Avenue North. A new site was later acquired on 3rd Avenue North but in 1880, the church sold the property and built a new church on the present site on 16th Street and 6th Avenue North, which was completed in 1884. However, the city condemned the structure in 1908 and placed an order for it to be demolished. The current building was designed by a prominent black architect, Wallace Rayfield taking influences from the Roman and Byzantine styles with construction completed in 1911. The church served as an important meeting point for the civil rights movement in the 1960s with Martin Luther King, Jr. among several notable speakers here. In 1963 the church was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan, killing four young girls. The church reopened for services in June 1964 after receiving more than $300,000 to restore it, and now visitors will be able to see a shrine in the crypt where the girls died, which is dedicated to their memory. Located in the rear center of the church at the balcony level is a vibrant stained glass window with the image of a black crucified Christ, which was a special memorial gift from the people of Wales and designed by John Petts.Tours of the church are led by guides with a presentation given about the history including the bombing as well as an interesting video. While in the area visitors may like to stop by the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute in 16th Street, which is a museum remembering the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s. Just a couple of hundred meters from the church and the museum is Kelly Ingram Park, which has many sculptures based on the civil rights movement including one of Martin Luther King Jr. There are many places nearby serving food including Green Acres Cafe, Brannon's Public House and Pete's Famous Hot Dogs, all of which are less than a kilometer from the church.

Other hotels nearby include Redmont Hotel, The Sheraton and Courtyard by Marriott, which are all within one and a half kilometers of the church."
"Alabama Adventure","Alabama","Alabama Adventure - Bessemer, Alabama - 200-acre family adventure theme park","Alabama Adventure originally opened on May 23, 1998 as VisionLand. In 2002, the amusement/adventure theme park changed its name to Visionland. When the park opened again in 2006, it was under the name of Alabama Adventure. Owned by Adrenaline Family Entertainment, the theme park hosts over 350,000 visitors per year in its May to October season. The Alabama Adventure Park consists of three separate parks - Magic City, a theme park with a wide variety of family and thrill rides; Splash Beach, a water park with several water play areas aimed at children and adults as well as several wild water rides, including water slides, water tubes, wave pools and a river raft ride; and Celebration Street, a dining and shopping area. The theme park that opened in 1998 was the result of years of work on the part of Fairfield Mayor, Larry Langford, who helped pull together a coalition of eleven cities to create the West Jefferson Amusement and Public Park Authority. The Authority enlisted the help of the state to raise $65 million to build VisionLand, which included four main attraction and activity areas - Celebration City Theme Park, Main Street, Steel Waters Water Park and Marvel City, a children's play area. Unfortunately, the park operated at a loss and the group filed for bankruptcy in 2002. VisionLand was purchased by the Southland Entertainment Group for $6 million. Southland added new rides, renamed VisionLand to Visionland, as well as renaming the water park and theme parks to Magic Adventure Theme Park, Splash Beach Water Park, Marvel City and Celebration Street. The park was renamed and re branded once again in 2006, and sold to Adrenaline Family Entertainment, who planned to add a hotel, an RV park and other amenities to turn the amusement and theme park into a full-featured family attraction. Among the most popular attractions at Splash Beach are the water slides. The newest water attraction, added in 2009, is a 216 foot water slide named UpSurge! UpSurge! takes riders up and down a half pipe before depositing them in a 25,000 gallon pool. Acapulco Drop is a free fall slide that drops sliders down nine stories, and Neptune's Plunge, one of the original water attractions, is a series of four enclosed tube slides. Younger children can relax in Salamander Bay or Castaway Island, while the bigger kids enjoy the Kahuna Wave Pool. Magic City features three thrilling roller coaster rides, including a custom-built wooden coaster named Rampage, which was one of the original attractions at VisionLand. A second coaster is a steel coaster that is actually located in Marvel City. The Marvel Mania is a family-friendly coaster that's reasonable for younger children. The Zoomerang was relocated from its original home in Sydney Australia in 2003. Other major attractions include a Carousel, monorail Ferris wheel and 25 other rides that vary in intensity from kid-friendly locomotives to wild spinners. The park is open from 10:30 AM to 8:00 PM, with Splash Beach open until 7:00 PM daily. General admission is $34.99, with reduced rates for seniors and children.

They also donated the zoo's seventeen acres and during 1994 thirteen undeveloped acres were donated by the Erie Meyer Foundation and the Ward Family. Hurricane Danny hit the area during July of 1997 followed by Hurricane George during 1998 which caused damage from flooding. The zoo evacuated the animals moving them fifteen miles farther inland to higher ground making it the first zoo to ever have a complete evacuation during a hurricane. The Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo almost closed during 1999 because of the cost of evacuating the animals and required repairs. Fund raising made it possible for the facility to remain open. Five hundred thousand dollars worth of damage was done in 2004 by Hurricane Ivan which caused another evacuation. The zoo was closed for fourteen months after the hurricane. A number of animals that could not be caught for the evacuation were lost. In 2005 another hurricane caused the facility to close. The Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo was approached by Animal Planet about a series after receiving a great deal of media attention after Hurricane Ivan. In 2005 the series began filing with the first thirteen episodes being shown during February of 2006. In February of 2007 there was an hour long follow up aired.

"Birmingham Civil Rights Institute","Alabama","Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, Birmingham, AL","Birmingham, Alabama was instrumental in civil rights movements, which is perhaps the reason why the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute was built there. From the time of the Civil War the rights of African Americans have been steadily gaining speed. It took over a century for great waves to be made and Martin Luther King Jr. to change a great many things. With the changes that occurred more African Americans were able to own stores and businesses, eventually making a mark on the community in Birmingham. All of this history and more is shared at the institute. The museum was first discussed in 1977 when Mayor David Vann stated a civil rights museum should be added to the city. In 1978 the city council endorsed the idea and in 1979 more study was needed before the building and museum would come to fruition. In fact it was not until 1987-88 that a design was finally chosen for the building and the funds were raised to build it. Now that the museum is open anyone can attend including school groups and other tours. Hours are Tuesday through Saturday 10am to 5pm, Sunday 1pm to 5pm, and closed on major holidays.

The state park includes the Cathedral Caverns, a welcome center and primitive camping sites. The cavern is a Karst cave with a large stalagmite forest, the opening of the caves is a massive 126 feet wide and 25 feet high, and inside the cavern is Big Rock Canyon, Mystery River and other magnificent formations created by Mother Nature. The park was declared a National Natural Landmark in June 1972. The motto of the state park is, `Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing but footprints, kill nothing by time'. This means that visitors are encouraged to take many photographs, stay on the marked trails to not ruin any of the vegetation of the park and to leave all plants where they are and to not destroy any part of the park. During heavy rains the caves are prone to flooding from The Mystery River. There is another 2,700 feet of caves that extend past the area that is opened to the public, this includes a crystal room. The formations in the Crystal Room are made of pure white calcite; the room is not open to the public as the vibrations from a person's voice would shatter more than 70 percent of the crystal formations. It has been discovered through archaeological excavations that at the mouth of the caverns Native Americans occupied the area around 2,000 years ago. The caves were bought by the State of Alabama in 1987 to open the area as a state park. The caves were not opened to the public until 2000 after funding delays and restoration works were completed. The Disney Studios film Tom and Huck filmed parts of the movie at the caverns in 1995, mainly the scenes when Injun Joe falls into a chasm. Tours of the caverns are held daily from around 10am until 4pm depending on the season with experienced tour guides who are able to guide visitors along the paved and lighted pathways and provide information about the history of the caves and details on the rare formations and how to be safe in the cave, and takes just over an hour. Walking down the slopes may be a little harder than going up due to the slipperiness of the area. There is wheelchair access available also. The caverns hold six world records: widest entrance of a commercial cave, home to the largest stalagmite in the world - Goliath, which is 45 feet tall and 243 feet in circumference. The caverns have the largest flow stone wall, the largest `frozen' waterfall, are the largest stalagmite forest in any cave in the world and have the most improbable stalagmite formation in the world. The caverns were originally called Bats Cave, but when original owner Jacob Gurley took his wife to the cave she was in awe of the beauty of the big room with the stalagmites and stalactites that she mentioned it looked like a `cathedral', so Gurley changed the name to Cathedral Caverns and the name has stayed in place even through its various change of ownerships."

"Civil Rights Memorial","Alabama","Civil Rights Memorial, Montgomery, AL","The Civil Rights Memorial is located in Montgomery, Alabama and stands as a monument to the forty people who died struggling for equality and integration of people of European and African descent. This memorial was sponsored by Southern Poverty Law Center. The names on the memorial are of those who died in the years between 1954 and 1968. These dates reflect the beginning of the fight for equality which began when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in schools was unlawful. The ending year was chosen because that was the year that Martin Luther King was assassinated. This memorial was created by the same artist that designed the Vietnam Memorial, Maya Lin. She also designed the Women's Table'' at Yale University. They dedicated the memorial in 1989. She chose this design because of the healing and soothing effect that water has. Maya Lin used the inspirational words of Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream'' speech. It was delivered on the National Mall in Washington D.C. August 28, 1963. These words are inscribed on the wall behind the memorial and they are we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream''. This passage is in reference to the Amos 5:24 from the King James Version of the Bible. The memorial is a round black stone shaped like an inverted cone, which is where there is a fountain.

The 1724 French fort has been partially reconstructed and now has musket and cannon firing demonstrations. The Museum of Mobile operates the facility which is a good deal smaller than the original fort to prevent its overwhelming the city. Fort Conde Museum and Welcome Center is open from eight in the morning until five in the evening. The original usage of the facility was to protect both Mobile and settlements that were further upstream from being attacked. In 1820 the fort that has once been occupied by Americans, Spanish, French and British Forces was destroyed. There is now a replica of 4/5 the original size in its place. Fort Louis de la Mobile was build twenty-seven miles from the Mobile River's mouth in 1702 by the French and Mobile, Alabama was founded. In 1711 the city was moved after flooding of the river damaged the fort so badly that it could not be repaired. The city was then Lousiana's (then a French colony) capital. A wooden stockade was immediately built when the city moved to the current location and named Fort Louis. A permanent brick fort on a stone base was completed by 1723 and given the name Fort Conde to honor King Louis XIV's brother. Over the years the name of the fort was changed several times as it changed hands due to power changes. In 1763 the lost control of the fort and the city to the British who maintained control until 1780 during which time it was known as Fort Charlotte. Then the Spanish gained control while assisting those fighting the American Revolution and it was known as Fort Carlotta until 1813. Again the fort changed names and changed hands. The U.S. Congress decided that Fort Conde was no longer need in order to protect Mobile Bay or the city during 1820 and its sale was authorized. The demolition was paid for by the city in order to have new streets and some of the bricks filled in the local marshes. Evidence that Fort Conde had ever existed was gone by 1823. The city saw a need to preserve history during the middle of the 1970's and began working on the fort's reconstruction.

"Fort Gaines","Alabama","Fort Gaines - Dauphin Island, AL - it took three decades to build and proved to be worth the wait","Mobile Bay and Dauphin Island were mapped by Alonzo Pineda as early as 1519. Pierre Le Moyne de'Iberville, a French explorer, gave it the name of Massacre'' due to the large amount of human remains found here. In spite of the findings he decided that a colony should be placed here due to the areas reliable fresh water source, amazing harbor and available timber supply. The area became home to the French colonization headquarters on the Gulf Coast. There were a number of private homes, warehouses owned by the government, a chapel and a fort that made up the colony. The name Dauphine was given to the island to honor the French throne heir during 1707. It was also the Louisiana Territory's capitol; the territory made up nearly 2/3rd's of the United States. The colony was rebuilt after a raid by pirates during 1711 but the settlement was nearly destroyed six years later by a hurricane. Dauphin Island's control switched back and forth between nations over the next century and was even used to launch an attack on Mobile at one point. After the War of 1812 proved that there was a need to improve defenses along the American coast the building of a fort on land began during 1821. There were a number of problems with the project such as water coming into the fort during high tide because of its proximity to the water. The fort went over budget and the army spent the next three decades trying to restart the building of the fort. Additional work was prevented by land disputes even after $20,000 was appropriated by Congress for the construction during 1845. In 1853 a clear title for the land was obtained by the army but the Chief Engineer Joseph G. Totten decided to stop building with the original plans and redesigned the fort from top to bottom. The new designed was much better than the old one and actually protected the Mobile Bay from land and the water. The fort was named for Edmund Pendleton Gaines who had gained national recognition by leading the detachment that captured Vice-President Aaron Burr and had away during 1849 by Congress during 1853. By the year 1861 the majority of the work on the fort had been completed. The Confederate States of America had to finish the work when the Civil War began and Fort Gaines was completed by 1862. Fort Gaines stood through the Civil War all the way through World War II and in 1926 the City of Mobile purchased it from the United States. The property was given to the Alabama Department of Conservation and then deeded to Dauphin Island Park and Beach Board. Fort Gaines now serves as a base for the Coast Guard. The numerous fatalities at the fort and on the land that it occupies have lent it to rumors of haunting. Anyone interested in obtaining additional information about the fort and its diverse history should contact the Alabama Department of Conservation directly."

"Kiva Dunes Golf Course, Gulf Shores, Alabama - the #1 Rated Golf Course in the State, Located Along Alabama's Gulf Coast","Alabama","Kiva Dunes Golf Course, Gulf Shores, Alabama - the #1 Rated Golf Course in the State, Located Along Alabama's Gulf Coast","Kiva Dunes is situated along the splendor of Alabama's Gulf Coast and is not only the #1-rated course in the state, but has also been said to be one of the most unforgettable, most challenging and most enjoyable golfing experiences in the country. The course was designed by former U.S Open Champion Jerry Pate, along with Kiva Dunes developer Jim Scrappy'' Edgemon, who both share in a love of links-style golf. As the story of the Kiva Dunes property goes, Pate first glanced upon the land in 1985 that would one day become Kiva Dunes and thought to himself, Golf architects would kill for this piece of property.'' Once chosen to be the course architect, Pate explained that he wanted a course design that could challenge the best players with long, forced carries and par fours, as well as complex greens that called for sound strategies and execution. But he also envisioned a course that allowed for simpler options for golfers who were seeking pure enjoyment. The result is a wide-open, links-style design that allows for both bump-and-run shots, if the course's well-documented winds are gusting, or the bombs-away'' American style of golf if the winds are quiet. Things get even more interesting on the greens, and many golfers leave the course talking about the speed of the putting surfaces. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,092 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 132. Those are not exactly daunting numbers, and the course - with its views of beach homes and the Gulf Coast - has been said to lull many a golfer with its picturesque scenery. Some of the most noteworthy features of the course include a great stretch of finishing holes, beginning with No. 13, a par-3 with a wicked, plunging pot bunker. No. 15 is a par-5 that plays to 540 yards from the tips, but can be dramatically more difficult if the winds are blowing that day. No. 17 is another par-3 that will have golfers hitting over a blue lake, while the finishing hole is a dramatic par-4 that plays to 458 yards, wraps around a lake, and features one of the longest greenside approach bunkers to be found. Since opening in 1995, the course has been recognized and awarded as one of the best in the country. Golf Digest magazine has consistently given Kiva Dunes high marks, including awards such as: Alabama's BEST Place to Play, and the #24 ranking among America's Top 75 Upscale Courses. The golfing is only half the story, however, as Kiva Dunes Resort has also been highly praised and received its own awards, such as ranking among the Top 75 golf resorts. The beachfront paradise combines a blend of Southern, Gulf Coast style, with West Indian, Spanish, North African and Southeastern American influences to produce a unique experience. The unspoiled beaches of the Alabama Gulf Coast are only a few paces away, and are known for their inviting and visually inspiring white sand and rolling dunes set against the backdrop of brilliant blue water. One of the resort's unique features is a Dunes Walkover - a private, wooden walkway that traverses the 30-foot dune that protects the resort and allows guests to traverse the native flora of the area until they reach the beach and the stunning view that opens up before them. In addition to the activities and lure of the coastal waters, the resort also offers other activities, such as tennis, along with a number of distinctive swimming pools -each designed as a tropical paradise that's been landscaped to blend in with its natural surroundings. For dining, the Kiva Dunes Restaurant offers breakfast, lunch and dinner."
"Lewis - Smith Lake & Dam - Jasper, AL - emergency power and an economical boost","Alabama","Lewis - Smith Lake & Dam - Jasper, AL - emergency power and an economical boost","North Alabama has a reservoir known as the Lewis Smith Lake on the Black Warrior River's Sipsey Fork. The lake takes up over twenty-one thousand acres in the counties of Cullman, Walker and Winston Alabama. There are over five hundred miles of shoreline covered by the three fingered lake with a level of five hundred and ten feet when it is full. Alabama Power created the lake with the Smith-Lake Dam which is the eastern United States largest earthen dam. The dam is twenty-two hundred feet long and up to three hundred feet high at the highest point. November 25, 1957 the construction on the dam started and it went into service on September 5, 1961. The area which is ideal for fishing is easy to find by taking Interstate 65. It is just an hour to the south of Huntsville or to the north of Birmingham. The Lewis Smith Lake & Dam was created for the production of hydroelectric power and the improvement of the traffic conditions on the river in addition to giving more opportunities for recreation. The area had suffered difficulties for a long time due to lack of water and the application was filed by Alabama Power on July 27, 1954 with the Federal Power Commission for hydroelectric projects on the Warrior River. The application included a powerhouse and dam at the Sipsey Fork tributary which is approximately fifteen miles away from Jasper. The project required not only buying out the residents of the flood area but relocating seventy-eight graves in four cemeteries that were in the flood zone for the dam. The project cost $29 million dollars and the Lewis Smith Lake & Dam were dedicated May 23, 1961. Lewis M. Smith the president of the Alabama Power Company is whom the lake and dam are named for. The powerhouse for Smith Dam has two electric generators that are each rated at nearly 79,000 kilowatts. The powerhouse is to the north of the dam and two tunnels carry water to it. The tunnels are almost two thousand feet long and twenty-six feet in diameter. There is an average of 233,000 megawatt hours put out by the generators annually which varies depending on the water available. The dam is only put into use to produce electricity when the demand requires it or the prices are favorable for its use. The limited supply of water necessary to create hydropower means that it cannot be used at all times although it is Alabama Power's most economical way to produce power. During times of drought producing hydroelectric power is reduced. The depth of the lake at its deepest point is two hundred and sixty-four feet. The land around Lewis-Smith Lake & Dam was mostly undeveloped until the 1980's when the recreational attractions and beauty of the area where enhanced with commercial and residential developments. The construction of the Lewis Smith Lake & Dam in Jasper, Alabama although it required the relocation of families actually benefited them by boosting the local economy. Anyone interested in hydroelectric power should make it a point to see how this dam has benefited the surrounding area."
"Limestone Springs Golf Club","Alabama","Limestone Springs Golf Club, Oneonta, Alabama - A 4 1/2-Star Golf Course and One of Alabama's Best-Kept Golfing Secrets","Located 25 minutes north of Birmingham, Alabama, Limestone Springs Golf Club is said to be created by nature, which supplied the course's dramatic elevations and breathtaking views of the Appalachian Mountains. The course is situated in a valley that is overlooked by two primary mountains - Red Mountain and Sand Mountain. As a result, the course is a blend of the area's ridges, valleys, bluffs, hillside limestone outcroppings, an abundance of creeks and streams, along with indigenous towering southern pines, hardwoods and lush vegetation. Former U.S. Open winner Jerry Pate then added the championship-caliber golf course, creating 18 holes that feature a number of elevated tees that overlook twisting, tree-lined fairways. The course, which opened for play in 1999, also features some of the most pristine, Crenshaw Bent grass greens in the state, which tend to be medium to small in size without a great deal of undulation. The fairways tend to be forgiving, punctuated by white-sand bunkers, creating a challenging, top-rated course spread over 225 acres. The par-72 course is not overly long, and plays to 6,987 from the Gold tees, with a USGA rating of 74.2 and a slope rating of 139 on Bermuda grass.  From the White tees the course plays to only 5,880 yards, so most golfers will most likely play the middle tees. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 1 and No. 10, both of which feature some spectacular views at the start of each nine. Hole No. 10 is the signature hole for the course, a par-4 that plays to 416 yards and lets golfers tee off downhill through a corridor of trees. From there, the hole doglegs to the right and requires an approach shot to a slightly elevated green guarded by some large bunkers. The course has been consistently rated 4 1/2 stars by Golf Digest's Place to Play, was ranked by Golf Digest as one of the Top 10 Upscale Golf Course Designs in the U.S., and was ranked by GolfWeek magazine in the top five public courses in Alabama. Limestone Springs also features a top-notch golf practice facility which includes a driving range and chipping and putting green. The course also features a fully stocked golf shop, and club rentals are available. There's also a plantation-style clubhouse with outstanding views of the valley, with dining available at the Grille & Patio. From the veranda, in particular, the clubhouse offers a view of the finishing hole, which Zagat's Survey voted one of golf's Best Finishing Holes'' in America. The resort also boasts a mountain-top swimming pool with spectacular views, lighted tennis courts, meeting rooms, along with a health and fitness facility. For lodging, the resort features a Golf Cottage, which contains two separate units, each with two bedrooms and other amenities for golfers and families that want to stay the weekend."

"Mardi Gras","Alabama","Mardi Gras - Mobile, AL - long before Bourbon Street there was Mobile","In 1703 the first celebration of the American Mardi Gras or the people's day'' was held in Mobile, Alabama. It is a family event that delights those of all ages from all over the country unlike its counterpart held in New Orleans each year which is geared toward a more mature crowd and not exactly kid friendly. The event which starts the day before Lent on Fat Tuesday lasts for two and a half weeks. During this time downtown Mobile's streets are full of floats, marching bands and thousands of people. The riders on the Mardi Gras floats were masks, sequins and stain while throwing items such as candy, doubloons, moon pies and beads into the crowds that line the streets of the city. The parades, buildings and virtually everything else along the parade route and in the city of Mobile is decorated for the festivities. The first celebration to be considered Mardi Gras in the United States was held during 1699 when Pierre La Moyne declared his camp to be Pointe du Mardi Gras which translates to Mardi Gras Point. This was when the Gulf Coast Region of Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi's Delta were first entered into by the European settlers. In 1700 French colonist began to celebrate Mardi Gras with group singing and feasting as they missed home. Mobile was officially named as the capital of the French province Louisiana during 1704 and until 1709 there was the celebration of Masque De La Mobile. The French soldiers found Societe de Saint Louise at Fort Lois de la Mobile and Mardi Gras became a holiday for the French colonists to remember their home. Mobile's festivities came to a halt with the Civil War which left the city both discouraged and disillusioned. Joseph Stillwell Cain was on a mission to raise Mobile's spirits on Fat Tuesday, 1866 and put on Chickasaw Indian regalia. Cain dubbed himself Chief Slacabormorinico and climbed onto a decorated coal wagon with a mule to pull it and had a single float parade in the streets of Mobile. This brought Mardi Gras back to life. A number of mystic societies and traditions surrounding the parades during Mardi Gras where founded by Cain and continue in the current celebrations. The Sunday prior to Ash Wednesday is known as Joe Cain Day and used to remember him. The Joe Cain Procession and parade finds people decorating every possible object since he participated in the activities personally until his death at the age of seventy-two. The Mardi Gras celebration held in Mobile has undergone numerous changes over the years that included stopping the use of national guard vehicles and changing the route to no longer include Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.

The zoo remained in this location until the 1960s, when officials decided to move it away from Oak Park to its own space. Since 1989, the Montgomery Zoo has been in its current location, and it has grown to have over 700 animals, representing over 150 species, all of which inhabit a 48-acre plot of land. This is one of just two zoos in the entire state that is accredited with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. As visitors enter the zoo, they can spend time learning about the gardens found at the entry plaza or grab a bite to eat at the zoo's Overlook Caf,, which provides a panorama of the entire facility for patrons. The exhibits are split into areas depending on the animal's habitat. Some exhibits have enclosures for a single species, while in other environments, several species live together as they would in the wild. In Australia, guests can see animals such as the red kangroo, magpie goose, wallaby, and black swan living together. There's a bridge where visitors can stand to overlook the field where these animals live. The Montgomery Zoo's Asia exhibit has Bengal tigers and Indian rhinoceroses.

Some of the most popular animals from Africa include African penguins, elephants, zebras, lions, cheetahs, gazelles, cranes, hippos, kudus, chimpanzees, and storks. Unlike many of the other exhibits, the South America section of the zoo focuses mainly on smaller, single-species exhibits, since many of these animals are predators.

"Morgan Historic Site","Alabama","Morgan Historic Site - Gulf Shores, AL - Mobile Bay's first line of defense","The historic Fort Morgan is at Mobile Bay's mouth and regarded as one of military architecture's finest examples. Daniel Morgan a hero of the Revolutionary War is where the post acquired its name. In 1834 the construction of the fort was completed and March of that year it gained its first garrison. The fort is maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission. The Alabama Historical Commission that operates Fort Morgan is located at 468 South Perry Street. The fort itself is open from eight in the morning until six in the evening while the museum does not open until nine and closes at five. The cost of admission for adults ages thirteen and older is $2, students aged six to twelve and senior citizens pay a dollar for admission to the facilities. Those with fifteen or more in the group receive a rate of $1 for adults and fifty cents for students. The Fort was built after the War of 1812 as Congress saw an increased need for fortifications on the southern and eastern coastlines. The fort was designed to control Mobile Bay's main ship channel and the star shape allowed for heavy concentrations of artillery fire to target enemy ships. The fire volume was maintained as well and the isolation of the fort enabled it to stand up against larger attacks. Fort Morgan and the sister forts were found to be out of date during the Civil War as the brick forts were continually attacked by steam powered and rifled cannon warships. Union Admiral D.G. Farragut was able to lead his fleet past the fort on the fifth of August in 1864 and only lost one ship proving the fort was out of date. After the war the Army began working on improvements to the coastal defense of the nation. Major improvements to the forts were not attempted until the 1890's with the Endicott program to upgrade the defenses of the nation. Fort Morgan's concrete gun positions were included in this program. The goal was still to keep enemy forces out of the Mobile Bay area. Between the years of 1896 and 1905 there were concrete batteries built that were manned during both the Spanish American War and the 1st World War in addition to the fort being occupied during the Second World War. The concrete batteries were not the primary defense by the 2nd World War. Today none of the Civil War's wooden structures occupy Fort Morgan. The lighthouse keeper's house is the oldest building found on the site and was built during 1872. The five other wooden buildings were built at the start of the twentieth century. Between the years of 1898 and 1910 the military base underwent a massive expansion. Fort Morgan's peak saw nearly a hundred structures at the site. The remaining buildings were once quarters for a hospital steward, staff officer, artillery officer and the post bakery. The administration building for the post is still standing as well. Anyone interested in additional information about Fort Morgan and its rich history should contact the Alabama Historical Commission."

"Rickwood Field Park","Alabama","Rickwood Field Park, Birmingham, AL","Rickwood Field Park in Birmingham, Alabama is listed as the oldest baseball park in America. The facility opened in 1911 when local businesses sponsored a local team. Blach's Department Store was most instrumental in getting the baseball field erected. At first there were just wooden outfield fences and wooden seats. The scoreboard was just as primitive in its design with chalk letters to show the score and innings. The board was 500 feet from home plate. The ball field is still being used, even in 2000. It has seen some updates since the original creation, with a brick green building, new scoreboard, and seating. In 2002 there was a 2002 Rickwood Classic bringing back a former Birmingham and Oakland A's pitcher. Vida Blue threw the opening pitch for the game, though he played in 1969. Rickwood Field Park offers souvenirs for visitors or those who take a trip online. There are a number of tee shirts looking back at the history of baseball and the various teams that used to exist. Books, caps, posters, and gifts are all sold in the gift store for anyone wishing to remember the history of the sport and current happenings. The facility is open for events only. This means whenever there is an event visitors to the state are able to go see a game, watch a camp, or just enjoy the old facilities. For example the Ron Papa Jack Baseball Camp is held in February daily from 3 to 5pm. There are other camps throughout the year that occur at this same time. Children can learn how to play or just come to watch other players. Miles College and Morehouse College offer a game from 12pm to 2:30pm in February as do other teams.

This conference is held each year from 9am to 3pm one day out of the year. Since the baseball season is typically a spring to end of summer sport, one can attend games at these times. The baseball camps are held just before the season really begins to give others a chance to try out and learn. To gain access to the field one must go to 1137 Second Avenue West in Birmingham. The interstate will take visitors to the right street at the Arkadelphia exit. Tickets are available at the facility or through the college. Since the teams and the park are such a hit one should consider buying tickets in advance for a game. Only those with a ticket will be let into the stadium for a tour and the fun.

"Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail at Highland Oaks, Marshwood/Magnolia Course, Dothan, Alabama - Hailed as Part of the Best Public Golf on Earth","Alabama","Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail at Highland Oaks, Marshwood/Magnolia Course, Dothan, Alabama - Hailed as Part of the Best Public Golf on Earth","Highland Oaks is located in the southeast corner of Alabama, and is part of the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail. The Trail is the largest golf course project ever attempted, and consists of 11 different sites across the state and a total of 468 championship-caliber holes. It's also very affordable, with The Wall Street Journal stating that the Trail may be the biggest bargain in the country.'' The New York Times also called the Trail some of the best public golf on Earth.'' The Highlands Oaks complex consists of four distinct nine-hole courses for a total of 36 holes, as well as some of the longest and most classically designed holes on the Trail. The Marshwood course is famous (or, perhaps, notorious) for one hole in particular: the par-5 sixth, which measures an intimidating 701 yards from the tips. The 422-yard ninth hole is also one of the best holes on the course, challenging golfers with a dogleg right, as well as a tilted green that's also elevated above a stretch of wetlands. The Magnolia nine is aptly named for the magnolia trees that dot the higher ground. The course is accessible via a 1,000-foot-long wooden bridge that traverses a tree-filled marshland. The signature hole on the Magnolia course is the 416-yard fifth, with a split-level fairway that presents golfers with a decision off the tee. The Highlands course is considered the core nine at Highland Oaks, and has its own distinctive personality, with a relatively open design but several lakes that are often in play. The sixth hole is particularly challenging, with an elusive peninsula green at the end of a downhill par-3. There's also a Short Course - a nine-hole par-3 course that challenges golfers with some difficult pin placements, three water holes and some of the best-putting Bermuda greens in the southern U.S. Golf Digest named the Highlands-Magnolia combination as the 7th-best new public course in America in 1994, and #31 in the magazine's list of America's Top 50 Affordable Courses. The Highland Oaks complex also offers practice facilities, including a driving range with grass tees and a short-game area. For dining and relaxing, there's a clubhouse with a restaurant for breakfast, lunch and full bar service. The Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail's Resort Collection also features a number of exceptional resorts."

The city surrounds this area, but when in the nature center and parkland one can be in forested land. Ruffner Mountain Nature Center provides 1,011 acres of natural land that has remained undeveloped for centuries. It is one of the only places in Red Mountain Ridge that has never been touched by industry. It is a ten minute drive from Birmingham to reach the nature center. There are walking and hiking paths to enjoy for a half day or full day. The trails offer an abundance of biodiversity with wetlands and wildlife. Some of the area within the park has been mined for iron, but this was in the earlier 19th century. The Ruffner Mountain Nature Center refers to a building and the park land. The facilities on site provide a lesson for visitors regarding the area and its history. Programs about nature and the environment exist for visits. There are also some exhibits like the raptors, turtles, and other native wildlife. Teachers can bring their classes to the nature center for a hike and tour of the facilities or families can come for the experience. The old facility on the site was redone in 2009.

This massive undertaking serves the Tennessee Valley, North Alabama, and South Central Tennessee. Sci- Quest is primarily a research park in which science education and workforce development can be learned. Many of the exhibits are dedicated to biological research, aerospace engineering, space and missile defense, and more. Sci-Quest was actually set up as a museum or learning center for children. The site was erected with the funds from volunteers in 1989. It took until 1999 for the museum or center to be completed though because of the over 100 permanent and interactive exhibits on display. Since its opening 500,000 visitors have graced this place. The mission is simple: to offer children a learning place to discover creativity, interactivity, and integrity. The exhibits are all lined up in seven themed areas for fun and games. Sci- Quest admission is $9 for adults, $8.50 for seniors, and $8 for children. There are memberships and a $1 military discount. The museum is open Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm, Saturday 10am to 6pm, and Sunday 1pm to 5pm. Major holiday closures do exist. One of the first stops for visitors to Sci-Quest is the Immersive Theatre. This theater offers CineMuse and Virtual Vortex as their current shows. The movies and fun will change throughout the years. The theater is part of the permanent exhibits and theater experience. Some of the non- permanent exhibits can be an extra charge. While a list of exhibits will not be provided here, it is possible to learn about the different offerings they have for children. Throughout the year Sci-Quest offers programs and camps to their children. It is unlike a children's museum in this fashion. There are camps like career quest, sprouting scientists, spring break camps, and morning and afternoon camps. Each of these camps will focus on a specific thing, like the sprouting scientists camps are held each month and each month there is a different theme. For example in January they offered smell, sight, hearing, and touch for a Senses theme. February is all about transformations such as weather and the effects of cold or hot weather on the earth as well as chemical reactions. Schools are able to take field trips to the center and parks for learning. For instance, a school that wants to have a field trip may do so with a science class to learn about physical science with interactive experiments or it might be for an astronomy lesson. Students that are home schooled will find Sci-Quest to be a great place to visit. Home school programs exist for students at home to do experiments, but more to be able to interact with other students like they would in a school setting. Outreach programs, parties, and rentals are all available at Sci-Quest. At this place there is something for everyone to enjoy, even the younger generations. Babies have their own little play land to experience learning tools."

The 122 acre zoo showcases some 750 animals that represent 250 species, including endangered species from six continents. The zoo traces its beginnings to a Southside firehouse which was home to a small menagerie of animals.

Lane Park was a larger parcel of land, which became home to the zoo and neighboring botanical garden. The facility which was originally known as the Jimmy Morgan Zoo first opened its doors to the public on April 2nd, 1955, with Monkey Island as its first exhibit. The city of Birmingham assumed control over the zoo in November 1995, and the name was changed to the Birmingham Zoo.

"Toomer's Corner","Alabama","Toomer's Corner - Auburn, AL - transition from college to downtown or just join in the celebration","Judge John J. Harper founded Auburn during 1836 and the city gets its name from a line out of an Oliver Goldsmith poem called The Deserted Village.'' In 1856 a Methodist institution was charted as a male college and during 1859 with a staff of only six eight students attended the first classes. The name of the college changed to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama during 1872 when it changed to a state own facility.

There are two large oak trees hang over the corner and are often covered in toilet paper when something good happens in Auburn. The tradition of hanging toilet tissue from the trees is known as rolling the corner and is thought to have begun during the 1950's. Up until the middle of the 1990's the tradition was reserved for athletic wins but has been used to celebrate anything good associated with Auburn in recent years.

"Wilson Lock & Dam","Alabama","Wilson Lock & Dam - Muscle Shoals, AL - the largest construction project of its time","The Wilson Dam spans the area of the Tennessee River found between Colbert and Launderdale Counties in Alabama. Wilson Lake is impounded by the Wilson Lock and Dam which is one of thirty-three dams on the Tennessee River that is under the authority of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The construction that began during 1918 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers was not completed until 1927. The Wilson Dam is actually older than the TVA and is one hundred and thirty-seven feet high. The dam covers 4,541 feet of the Tennessee River and was nearly forty-seven million dollars to build. The Dam's main lock is 110 ft high by 600 ft long with the maximum lift being 100 feet. This lift at the Wilson Lock & Dam is the highest single lock that can be found to the east of the Rocky Mountains. There is also an auxiliary lock with two sixty feet deep by three hundred foot long chambers that are operated in tandem. The Dam sees almost four thousand vessels travel through the lock each year. Wilson Lock & Dam is named for former United States President Woodrow Wilson and has the ability to generate 675 mega watts of electricity. The Dam is used for flood control, the regulation of the six hundred and fifty mile navigational channel and to provide over one hundred billion KW hours of electricity to the seven states that make up the Tennessee Valley Region. The lock for the Wilson Dam was built during 1959 and has recently been damaged. There are plans to build a seven story hotel on the banks of the river overlooking the dam to soften the visual effects. Wilson Dam & Lock is one of the world's highest single lifts and is located on Highway 133 in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The project was the first one to establish a federal hydroelectric project and was the first success attempt at gaining access to the Tennessee River's potential. While the original purpose of the Wilson Lock & Dam was national defense the project's completion led the way to economic diversification and industrialization of the area and improved the lives of area residents. Major Harry Burgess the Nashville District Engineer submitted a survey report that showed the Dam to be the American public works most ambitious project of the time. The construction required almost one and a half a million cubic yards of rock and earth to be excavated to make room for it and used over one million cubic yards of concrete. There were over four thousand men working at the site during the peak of the construction. With 630,000 KW the Wilson Lock & Dam is still ranked as one of the nation's highest capacity hydroelectric plants after seventy-five years in existence. There was a comprehensive survey taken of the Tennessee River's future improvement and economic potential by the Nashville District at the same time the dam was constructed. The valley's multipurpose development was the result of this study. The sheer size and vast history of the Wilson Lock & Dam make it a must to see for anyone in the Muscle Shoals, Alabama area."
