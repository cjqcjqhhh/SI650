The Mississippi River that for years has been a source of revenue for its inhabitants, Mardi Gras, the delicious cuisine and the French Quarter are all a part of what makes New Orleans great. It is in the south east part of the state and is in the Orleans Parish. Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was part of the French Mississippi Company that founded the city in 1718. He gave the city the name after the Duke of Orleans, Philippe II. New Orleans had been under the control of both the French and Spanish before it became part of the United States.

"BREC's Baton Rouge Zoo in Baton Rouge, Louisiana","Louisiana","BREC's Baton Rouge Zoo in Baton Rouge, Louisiana","As early as 1960, a zoo in Baton Rouge, Louisiana had been an idea dreamed up by the Recreation and Parks Commission. In 1965, Louisiana taxpayers approved a mileage election that provided $375,000 in revenue, which was procured for constructing the facility. A Zoo Director was hired to assist with designing and implementing plans for the zoo, and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation matched the existing funds. Construction of the zoo began in 1966, and the BREC's Baton Rouge Zoo was first opened to the public on Easter Sunday in 1970. Over time, the zoo has continued to grow in popularity and has become the number one tourist attraction in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Guests are invited to view a collection of more than 1,800 animals that call the beautifully landscaped zoo home. One of the greatest historical occasions at the zoo was the Penny March which raised funds to assist the zoo with purchasing a new elephant. The Elephant Oasis contains a shaded pavilion from which guests have prime views of the zoo's collection of Asian elephants. The exhibit is an informational display filled with conservation graphics and videos about the elephants, a sculpture of a baby elephant and a misting system designed to keep guests cool in the heat of the summer. The focus of the program is to enable elephants to be placed in the spotlight and talk about their plight in the wild. As an educational and interest point of the zoo, the oasis is dedicated to making sure future generations have the chance to see and learn about the magnificent creatures. Guests will enjoy the Otter Pond, an exhibit that features a replica of a fishing cabin, complete with an underwater viewing of the otters.

"Copper Mill Golf Course, Zachary, Louisiana - A Championship, Links-Style Golf Course a Short Drive from Baton Rouge","Louisiana","Copper Mill Golf Course, Zachary, Louisiana - A Championship, Links-Style Golf Course a Short Drive from Baton Rouge","Copper Mill Golf Course is an 18-hole championship, links-style course located a short drive from Baton Rouge. Copper Mill was designed by golf course architects Max Maxwell and Nathan Crace, and has been described as an eclectic mix of old-world shot-making and contemporary conditioning, producing a course reminiscent of those in Scotland. The par-72 course plays to an even 7,000 yards from the Black tees on Bermuda grass fairways and Tifdwarf greens, with a USGA rating of 73.7 and a slope rating of 133. The layout features open fields and roughs of native grasses, strategically placed bunkers and centuries-old oak trees that can tower over the course. Golfers unfamiliar with the area might forget they're in South Louisiana, until they encounter two holes that crisscross the Cypress Bayou. A distinctive feature of Copper Mill is a layout that incorporates three par-3s, three par-4s and three par-5s on each nine, making for a bit of a change from the traditional arrangement found on most golf courses. Copper Mill is a residential course, but the design was routed through the natural setting in such a way as to allow for spacious fairways and playing areas without a feeling of being crowded by homes. Some noteworthy holes and features include the par-3 No. 6 hole that plays to 173 yards from the Black tees and has a hidden green. The par-5 No. 14 hole plays to 525 yards from the back tees and is a double-dogleg that's been called a subtle beast.'' Getting to the pin is hard enough, and once there golfers will find the green guarded by two sprawling sand bunkers and situated on a triangle-shaped peninsula surrounded by water. Another noteworthy hole is the par-4 No. 17, which plays to 445 yards from the back tees and is guarded on the left side of the approach by the ruins of an old mill.

"Gray Plantation Golf Course","Louisiana","Gray Plantation Golf Course, Lake Charles, Louisiana - A Golf Course Ranked No. 3 in the Nation for Courses Under $50","The Gray Plantation Golf Course has a couple of unique honors to its credit. For one, Golf Digest rated it #75 on its list of Top 100 Golf Courses in 2005. Secondly, it's also quite the bargain for such a top-notch golf course, costing only around $50, even during peak golf season. As a result, it's also been honored with a ranking of No. 3 in the nation for courses that cost under $50. The Gray,'' as it's known locally, is also one of the most beautifully landscaped courses with a good deal of challenge. Golfers who like water will love this course, which is nestled between two winding lakes, Lake Matilda and Indigo Lake. All told, there are 60 acres of lakes found on the course, as well as marshes, wooden bridges, and 94 sand bunkers. There are few forced carries off the tee, however, and trouble can be avoided with conservative shot selections. The 18-hole, par-72 course was actually lengthened with the addition of several tees after a PGA Tour Player named Mike Heinin shot a 58. The course now plays to 7,233 yards from the championship tees, with a USGA rating of 73.6 and a slope rating of 138. The course, which opened in 1999, was designed by William Rocky'' Roquemore, who made use of the natural topography to create and feature some tough par-3s. There are two with island greens, including the No. 6 signature hole - a scenic hole that borders the Calcasieu Waterway and features the smallest green on the course. Another noteworthy hole is the par-5 No. 7, which plays to 589 yards from the back tees and features water along the entire left side. And that's not even the tricky part. If viewed from above, the fairway is shaped like a question mark, and golfers must decide if they want to cross the water and try a shortcut to reach the green in two, or play to the landing area on their second shot, then cross the water on their third shot.

Visitors explore the French Quarter that is the heart of the city. They will find restaurants, jazz clubs, shopping and historical buildings. Many of the buildings in the city are museums and have been named as National Historic Landmarks. The Hermann-Grima House is a pink brick home that was built in 1831. There is a Spanish influenced wrought iron balcony along the front of the building. However, the architecture is of the Federal style. The home is located at 820 Saint Louis Street in the French Quarter. Before the Civil War this area was comprised of rich Creole families. Their homes were elegantly appointed and the museum has returned this mansion to its glory days. The Golden Age of New Orleans as it was known can be experienced on a guided tour. There is a courtyard garden for the visitor to tour. The outdoor kitchen was the only functional one in all of the French Quarter in its day. There was also a horse stable at the Hermann-Grima House which was another unusual structure in the French Quarter homes in 1830. Every detail has been researched so that the home looks as beautiful for today's modern visitor as it did when the home was inhabited. The restoration was completed by looking through archaeological studies as well as inventories and the building contract. The museum contains everything that a rich Creole family would have owned from 1830 through 1860. The Hermann-Grima House is transformed into a house of mourning from mid-October to early November. The exhibit is calledSacred to the Memory''. The mansion is decorated for a nineteenth century funeral and all of its customs. Guests will find a coffin stand with coffin in the parlor, waiting for the wake to begin. The mirrors will be draped and a black wreath is placed on the front door. Christmas at the Hermann-Grima House shows the mansion in greenery with grand decorations. The decorations are indicative of what would have been used in the nineteenth century. Handmade ornaments and local customs give the visitor an old fashioned Christmas experience. Guests on the guided tours are treated to the cooking program that is planned on every Thursday from October through May. Volunteers have been trained in the preparation and cooking methods that were used in an 1830's kitchen. The recipes show how the New Orleans cuisine was developed, with French, Spanish, Native American and African influences.

"Hotel Maison de Ville & Audubon Cottages, New Orleans","Louisiana","Hotel Maison de Ville & Audubon Cottages, New Orleans","Many of the historic buildings in the French Quarter and New Orleans were destroyed in the fire of 1788. However, buildings that replaced them are just as historic. The Hotel Maison de Ville or townhouse'' was built in the 1800's and the owner was Jean Baptiste Lilie Sarpy. The two storied home has been visited by the famous playwright, Tennessee Williams. One resident of the Hotel Maison de Ville was Antoine Peychaud. He was an apothecary credited with making Peychaud Bitters. He used an egg cup to blend bitters and brandy in what is conceived as the first cocktail. The bitters are still being made today and are an integral part of the New Orleans drink called Sazerac. Mr. Peychaud had an apothecary on Royal Street instead of in the lower portion of the hotel. Although no documentation is available it is thought that the carriage house and former slave quarters are some of the oldest buildings in the city. The Creole's often built homes for their adult sons to live until they married. The chance that some of these outbuildings were used for this purpose has also been considered. Tennessee Williams finished his novel A Streetcar Named Desire while residing at the hotel in room number nine. It had a view of the patio with the greenery and flowers that Mr. Williams liked. The Main Building of the hotel is not currently open for reservations, but previous guests have been able to stay in room nine. There are seven cottages that make up the Audubon Cottages. They were so named for the painter John James Audubon. He lived in Cottage number one when he was working on his Birds of America series. Cottage number seven served as his studio. The pool that is at the Audubon Cottages is made of bricks and it is thought to be the oldest swimming pool in New Orleans. They are located on Dauphine Street in the French Quarter. Most of the Audubon Cottages are two bedrooms with double, queen and king size beds. There are two bathrooms in all of the two bedroom cottages. Some have Jacuzzi tubs for relaxation. Cottage number two offers a hardwood floor in the living room; it also has a dining table and private courtyard. Elizabeth Taylor spent some time in Cottage number two.

There are not a lot of residents of the island, but it is well known for its salt mining, sugar plantations, and hot sauce. The island is also a bird sanctuary and filled with numerous exotic plants. The rock salt that the island is made up of makes it difficult for anyone to reside on the island, though as mentioned some do. To get to the island there is a toll road which charges $1. One place to visit while on Avery Island is Jungle Gardens. Edward Avery was born on the island in 1872. He became an arctic explorer, conservationist, and naturalist. While on Avery Island he studied the salt marshes, plants, and animals. In 1895 Edward Avery founded a private bird sanctuary for the snowy egret. Jungle Gardens began in 1920 when Edward Avery opened up the private sanctuary into a public one. The estate was part of his Jungle Gardens park featuring a number of botanical plants from around the world. The gardens eventually became the 250 acres it is today. As part of the garden creation Edward made a gully into a Sunken Garden and created a Palm Garden in a sand mining pit. Camellias and Azaleas native to Louisiana can be found during mild winters and summer months. It took until 1935 to have the gardens completed and ready for actual public viewing. Jungle Gardens provides a five mile drive for visitors today. There are oak groves, lagoons, wisteria, hollies, camellias, and wildlife to view during the drive. There are also some short walks visitors can take when they park their car in designated spots. The road leads to a tiled pavilion which has an ancient Cleveland Oak.

In the 1920's a Chinese warlord sent the Buddha to America, but no one claimed it so it sat in a New York City Warehouse until 1936. It was purchased by Avery to be placed in his Asian Garden section of the park. A forest pool, stone bridge, glass temple, Sasanqua, and bamboo surround the Buddha. The road one follows to get around Jungle Gardens begins at a gatehouse with an education area. Visitors can stop at the center to learn about the variety of plants, bird species, and other wildlife.

"Koasati Pines Golf Course at Coushatta Casino Resort","Louisiana","Koasati Pines Golf Course at Coushatta Casino Resort, Kinder, Louisiana The Longest Golf Course in Louisiana","The Koasati Pines Golf Course opened in 2002 and immediately assumed the ranking as longest golf course in the state of Louisiana. At 7,617 yards from the longest tees, the 18-hole, par-72 course plays on Bermuda grass and has a USGA rating of 76.7 and a slope rating of 137. Adding to the challenge and the beauty of the course, it's nestled amid the natural wetlands of Southwest Louisiana and 65 acres of lakes. All told, the course features water on 15 of its holes. The course is also well-bunkered and features undulating greens. The course features a number of especially noteworthy holes, including No. 2. This demanding par-4 plays to 417 yards, and water comes into play along the entire left side of the fairway. Assuming players find this narrowing fairway, their approach shot must reach a green fronted by water. Hole No. 6 is another par-4 that plays even longer at 446 yards. On this hole golfers encounter something called quick-sand'' bunkers that come into play on all shots. The water hazard can also be a bit daunting and distracting on this hole, as all the tee boxes are right on its edge and the water runs the length of the hole on the left. Tee shots must choose the right or left side of an elongated donut-hole fairway with sand traps running through its heart. Approach shots then play to a green fronted by a bunker, with water in play on any stray shots to the left. Hole No. 9 is not a normal par-5. For one thing, the hole plays to 624 yards. Adding to the challenge, tee shots play to a peninsula fairway bordered on three sides by water. The second shot must then cross water to another peninsula fairway bordered by water, while the approach shot plays to a green nestled up against even more water. Hole No. 16 is a long par-3 that plays to 225 yards and is protected by water along the right side of the hole. The green is also guarded by a long sand trap on the right, so it's not uncommon for golfers just to try to play their tee shots long and past the hole, then try for par with an up-and-down from behind the green. The finishing hole on the course is another par-5 that plays to 588 yards. The signature hole on the course, players will be forced to make some difficult decisions on what is one of the most picturesque and unique holes in golf. The tee shot takes golfers to a triangle-shaped fairway landing area bordered on two sides by water. And then it gets really interesting, as golfers have a choice of hitting over water to either the left or right legs of a fairway shaped like an upside-down horseshoe, or carrying all water to the green located at the top of the horseshoe. Koasati Pines also features a practice area that includes a driving range and putting green. Lessons are also available. The clubhouse features locker rooms, a Pro Shop, meeting space and The Veranda, which can be used for indoor and outdoor events. For casual food, snacks and beverages, there's the Eagle Bar & Grill. The Coushatta Resort also offers six restaurants, lodging and casino gaming."

"Lake Martin","Louisiana","Lake Martin, Breaux Bridge, LA","Breaux Bridge, pronounced Bro'' Bridge is a small town in Louisiana. It is also considered the Crawfish Capital of the World.'' An Acadian pioneer named Firmin Breaux settled the town in 1771 when he purchased the land from Jean Francois Ledee, a New Orleans merchant. Breaux Bridge is close to Lafayette LA towards the lower section of the state. It is not on the coast though. The city got its name from the footbridge Breaux created so that neighbors and friends could reach his place from Bayou Teche. The bridge was a suspension footbridge, and residents would say Go to Breaux's Bridge'' when giving directions. Breaux Bridge is near Lake Martin, a popular place for residents and tourists to visit. Lake Martin is a shallow lake with Cypress and Tupelo trees. Aquatic life such as amphibians and reptiles fill the lake. There are also fish in the shallow waters. Lake Martin is across from St. Martin Parish on highway 94. It is in the Mississippi River flood plain. The lake has numerous walkways and trails for visitors to walk along. There are also areas for driving before ending at the Cypress and Buttonbush thicket. This is the end of the lake. Many species of wading birds hang out here. Birds like Blue Heron, Great, Snow, and Cattle Egrets, White Ibis, Roseate Spoonbills, and Night Herons nest at this area in the summer. Barred and Great Horned Owls, Pileated, Hairy, Downy, and Red Bellied Woodpeckers, and Parula are other species at the lake. In the winter Rusty Blackbirds can be found there. The trails allow visitors to walk towards the end of the lake. However, visitors have to be on the lookout for alligator nests while they are walking. These nests are large mounds of dirt and leaves. The mothers tend to guard them very well. Some of the trails at the lake will be closed for alligator nesting season to avoid any injury. During the migration season buntings and songbirds will stop at Lake Martin. The area is a perfect place for birdwatchers to see many North American species. At Lake Martin it is possible to take swamp tours. These tours are eco swamp tours set up for educational purposes. The tours are open all year round except for holidays. Airboats are used to skim the water since it is too shallow for a regular boat. The air boats use a large fan on the back to propel the boat through the water. Alligators can often be seen sunning themselves on logs, or in the shallow water. In some cases it is possible to see the alligators feed. Banyan trees grow very tall in the swamp presenting covering in some areas. Alligators also walk on land, so the tours will point out those that might be out of the water on the shores. Lake Martin is not a place for swimming or lying on the beach. It is a place to see bird species and alligators in their natural habitat."

"Lalaurie Mansion, New Orleans","Louisiana","Lalaurie Mansion, New Orleans","The Lalaurie Mansion has one of the most notorious reputations in New Orleans because the wife of the owner of the mansion was considered to be a murderess. Delphine Macarty was born sometime in the late 1700's. Her parents were supposedly killed years later in an uprising of slaves. This may have been the explanation for Delphine's strange behavior in later years. She was married and widowed twice before becoming the wife of Dr. Louis Lalaurie. They purchased the mansion in 1831 at 1140 Royal Street. She enjoyed a glorious reputation as a great hostess and everyone attended her extravagant parties. She had relatives in government and all the most notable people were the Lalaurie's friends. The Lalaurie Mansion is considered to be haunted because of all the tragedies that apparently took place in the house. Delphine showed a completely different face to her acquaintances than she did to her slaves. There is a story about the mansion and its history in the book Haunted New Orleans. It chronicles the Mistress of Death: The Haunted History of Madame Lalaurie. Mrs. Lalaurie was a very influential person in New Orleans and very intelligent as well. The mansion was opulent for the times even though the outside was very modest looking. Inside the three stories there are mahogany doors that have been carved by hand. They are decorated with flowers and faces. There are chandeliers that lit the home with great illumination. Many items for the household were purchased in Europe. The mansion was kept in pristine condition by many slaves. They were found to be treated very badly by the lady of the mansion. For many years nothing was said when the slaves in the house or stable would disappear. It wasn't until a neighbor heard the screams of the young girl and noticed Mrs. Lalaurie chasing a young slave with a whip. The two continued up to the roof of the mansion where the girl jumped to her death. While the neighbor didn't see anyone bury the slave she did see a grave under one of the trees in the Lalaurie yard. New Orleans had laws that would keep the slaves from cruelty by their owners. After the neighbor reported the young girl's death the authorities decided to look into the treatment of the Lalaurie slaves. They took the slaves away and later sold them at the local auction. Unfortunately for the slaves it was a relative of Mrs. Lalaurie that purchased them. They were secretly resold to the Madame of the mansion. A fire in 1834 in the kitchen at the Lalaurie Mansion proved the allegations of inhuman treatment of the slaves and was brought to light. The cook who was chained to the stove was thought to have started the fire to get the authorities attention. What was found in the attic of the mansion was gruesome. Most of the slaves were dead and all of them had been tortured in some manner. The family disappeared and no one is sure if they lived in the surrounding area of New Orleans or if they fled to Paris."

"Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport","Louisiana","Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport","New Orleans, Louisiana is a city full of attractions. Visitors to the area can enjoy the museums, aquariums, historical buildings, and business centers. To arrive in New Orleans travelers can either drive or fly directly into Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. In the 1930's it was determined the city of New Orleans needed a larger airport since the Municipal Airport on the lakefront was no longer sufficient. The airport was unable to handle the air transportation requirements. It was decided that the original airport could not be expanded. The city government and FAA decided to build a new airport. By the 1940's a site had been chosen called the Kenner Site. 648 acres were purchased. It took several more years for the airport to begin construction because of the war. However, Moisant Field was taken over as an air base for the US Government. The government did build some facilities on the site. Finally in 1946 the commercial service started. They created the airport on 1360 acres of land with a 5000 foot runway and 7000 foot runway. They also installed the first Instrument Landing System. By 1974 there were 42 gates at the airport. The airport was not named after Louis Armstrong until 2001 in honor of the jazz musicians 100th birthday. Today the airlines at the airport include AirTran, American Air, Continental, Delta, JetBlue, Northwest, Southwest, United, and US Airways. There are four concourses at Louis Armstrong Airport, with a main terminal leading to each. New Orleans is a port city, which means cargo comes in and out of the town. The international airport helps bring in some of that cargo. LANOIA for short is the ninth largest origin and destination airport in the United States. Several Latin American countries fly directly to the airport, along with other international flights. The airport offers more than 12000 jobs.

As the largest fixed dome structure in the world, the Superdome has been host to countless events since it opened its doors in 1975. In addition to the Saints, the Superdome is home to a number of Tulane University sports teams, known as the Tulane Green Wave. Some of the stadium's most memorable events include countless Super Bowl games, the New Orleans Wine and Food Experience, the Essence Music Festival, a mass held by Pope John Paul II, a number of legendary professional boxing matches, and countless concerts with artists such as the Rolling Stones, Frank Sinatra, the Goo Goo Dolls, and U2. Ground was broken on the Superdome in 1971, after the Louisiana congress passed legislation allowing for a new domed sports complex in 1966. In 1975, the stadium's inaugural game was played between the Houston Oilers and the New Orleans Saints. The Superdome cost $163 million to build. The Stadium is operated by SMG, and was designed by architect Nathaniel Curtis of Curtis & Davis. The contractor was Huber, Hunt & Nichols. The Superdome has a capacity of 72,968 for football, but due to its size, is often used for other events. Basketball games are provided with a capacity of 55,675, while baseball games offer space for 63,525. At one point, the stadium held 87,500 for a Rolling Stones concert in the `80s.

The surface area of the stadium is 269,000 square feet, while the total interior space is 125 million cubic feet. The Superdome offers patrons access to 88 restrooms and 132 luxury box suites, along with a number of on-site ATMs. A limited number of wheelchairs are available for free rental at the venue, and there are ten elevators to make moving through the Superdome easier. The field itself is composed of FieldTurf, which was initially installed in 2003, but had to be replaced after the events of Hurricane Katrina. Four scoreboards (8' x 60') and two DiamondVision Panels (28'7'' x 36'3'') hang within the venue, adding a nice touch to special events. On-site parking is readily available for fans, with four parking garages with space for around 5,000 vehicles. Two surface lots are also located adjacent to the structure. In 2005, the Superdome served as a refuge from those seeking to escape the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. Roughly 30,000 people sought shelter there after the incident. Since then, the stadium has undergone extensive repairs and renovations, totaling $193 million and closing it down from 2005 to 2006. Currently, the Superdome is set for a number of renovations to help modernize the venue. Costing roughly $320 million, the improvements range from windows being added to allow more light to enter the stadium, to a complete refurnishing of the club suites. Along with this, patrons will now be able to use credit cards at concession stands, something sure to be a very welcome improvement."

"Mardi Gras, New Orleans","Louisiana","Mardi Gras, New Orleans","The Mardi Gras of New Orleans today has its roots in Medieval Europe. There is no correlation of how it has become one of the greatest parties in the world though from this origin. The history of Mardi Gras was tracked to the Romans, but it was a French-Canadian explorer that helped the south celebrate Mardi Gras for the first time in 1703. This happened not in New Orleans, however. It was in what is now Mobile, Alabama. Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville named the piece of land where he landed in 1699 Pointe due Mardi Gras''. A secret society was formed in 1704 called the Masque de la Mobile and it is felt that this was a precursor of today's modern krewes. This society was part of Mardi Gras until 1709. Another one took its place, but the name was changed to Boeuf Graf Society''. They had a bull head mounted on a rolling cart that they paraded through the streets. This celebration was done on the Tuesday before the start of Lent. The 1740's saw the first balls being held and in 1871 another krew was formed. Floats, Kings and making Mardi Gras a legal holiday all came about in the 1870's. King Cakes are part of the tradition of Mardi Gras just as balls, floats and beads are. This Christian faith tradition began as the Feast of the Epiphany where it has its roots in the three kings that visited the baby Jesus, bearing gifts. Baking a cake was part of honoring the three kings. There is a baby that is inserted into the baked King Cake. The person that gets the piece of cake with the baby is to host the next King Cake party. They were made of simple dough formed into a ring then iced with the Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold. Many people may not know that Mardi Gras is a forty seven day celebration with the culmination being on Shrove Tuesday. The parade floats are made right in New Orleans and the main float maker is the Blaine Kern studio. They employ artists to design, sculpt, paint and animate the Mardi Gras floats every year. The studio has been in business since 1947 and offers tours. Part of this attraction is to make your own float with the help of the people in your tour group. Throwing coins, beads and stuffed animals from the floats has been around since 1870 when the Twelfth Night Revelers, a Krew, began the tradition. In today's parades the coins that are thrown have the parade theme on one side and the Krewes emblem on the other. There are also Celebrity King doubloons that are considered collector's items. The competition for all the items that are thrown from the floats is formidable and fun. The streets of the French Quarter are closed during parade time so that the many revelers can party. There will be plenty of music coming from the many establishments in the French Quarter. Book hotels rooms well in advance if visiting during Mardi Gras."

"Old Absinthe House, New Orleans","Louisiana","Old Absinthe House, New Orleans","New Orleans, Louisiana is in the south east corner of the state and has one of the busiest sea ports in the United States. Common nicknames for the city are The Big Easy and The Crescent City. While most other states divide their state into counties, Louisiana has parishes and New Orleans is in the Orleans parish. The city is well known for its celebration of Mardi Gras, jazz music and Creole and Cajun cuisine. New Orleans was founded in 1718 and there are many historical buildings that provide a glimpse into this architectural era. One of the buildings that still stands today is the Old Absinthe House. The building was erected in 1807 and was originally used as an importing business. Pedro Front and Francisco Juncadelia of Barcelona were the owners. This building sits on the corner of Bourbon and Bienville streets and really became the first corner grocery store'' in the area. The business of selling items of food, tobacco and Spanish spirits continued for about forty years. In 1815 the nephews of Senora Juncadelia took over the ground floor to run a coffee house. The name was changed from Aleix's Coffee House to The Absinthe House after the creation of a drink called the Absinthe House Frappe in 1874. The drink became famous in New Orleans and when people visit they can still see the original marble fountains that helped create this famous concoction. These fountains dripped cool water over sugar cubes that were positioned over glasses of the alcohol Absinthe. Famous celebrities became fond of absinthe throughout the years. P.T. Barnum, Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, General Robert E. Lee and Edgar Allen Poe were among some of the more famous patrons of the Old Absinthe House. The original bar was made of wood and then topped with copper. During Prohibition the bar was removed so that it could be kept safe from destruction. The bar top was taken back to the original bar in 2004. There are rumors that the pirate Jean Lafitte met with Andrew Jackson at the bar to plan strategies to win the Battle of New Orleans. That is why the tavern bears the name of Jean Lafitte's Old Absinthe House. Tony Moran who is a descendant of Diamond Jim Moran'' a famous legend in New Orleans now owns the Old Absinthe House. Absinthe was prohibited in 1912 because of its known narcotic properties. Today the Absinthe House Frappe is made mainly with Herbsaint, a more acceptable spirit. There are other drinks that can be found at the Old Absinthe House such as an Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Mint Julep and an Absinthe Suissesse. Many of these drinks are considered to represent the history of New Orleans and are favorites of the residents. The French Quarter is a popular place to stay and is considered to be the heart of New Orleans. Meals are available at the many restaurants in the area. In the evening the French Quarter is closed to traffic so that the parties from the many clubs, bars and restaurants can spill into the streets."
"Old State Capitol","Louisiana","Old State Capitol, Baton Rouge, LA","New Orleans was made the capitol of Louisiana in the 1700's, but in 1847 Baton Rouge gifted $20,000 of land to Louisiana for a state capitol building, thus moving the long held title away from New Orleans. The building was built to overlook the Mississippi River by sitting atop a bluff. The construction of the house or State Capitol Building was based on gothic revival. James Harrison Dakin was the architect in charge of the design providing towers, stained glass windows, and gables. It looks very much like a 15th century Gothic Cathedral. Iron was even used in the construction to keep up that appearance. In 1862 the building was used as a prison by the Union soldiers. It was also used to jail African American troops. The building caught fire twice and was eventually emptied and abandoned by the Union. In 1882 the house was renovated by William Freret. He added a spiral staircase and stained glass dome to the structure. These renovations lasted until 1932 as the capitol seat. A new building was created and the Old State Capitol was turned into a place for veteran organizations and Works Progress Administration. In 1990 the building was turned into a museum for Baton Rouge residents and tourists. Since it is a museum it is open to visitors during Monday through Saturday from 10am to 4pm. Sunday hours are noon to 4pm. However, from June till March the museum is not open on Mondays. There is a small fee for admission. The museum is considered one of political history. It is possible to schedule tours or to just walk through. Inside the building the walls, floors and ceilings are very ornate. They are typical of French styles of the 1800's when the building was first erected. A lot of reds and yellows were used along with many chandeliers and mirrors. Opulent is the best word to describe the interior decor. There are a number of exhibits in the museum. The first exhibit is a small welcome area to discuss the history of the building. The tour moves to the Governor's suite of offices where a list of governors can be found as well as artifacts they may have had during their stay at the house. From there it is possible to reach the National Representation Exhibit which shows the congressional leaders of now and the past. Huey Long Animatronics have an exhibit called The Kingfish Speaks.'' It is a one of a kind display. The Statehouses of Louisiana are shown in the next few exhibits. The different cities in which the capitol has been as well as architectural interests are explained. The second floor of the museum hosts other exhibits like the Louisiana Purchase, Agricultural department, Senate and House Chambers. Political history regarding voting, electing officials, and on air speeches are also on display at the museum. The museum is not Baton Rouge's only place to visit for tourists, but it is rich with history for those who enjoy learning."

"St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans","Louisiana","St. Louis Cathedral, New Orleans","New Orleans in the state of Louisiana lies in the south eastern area of the state. The Mississippi River plays an important part in the lives of its residents as New Orleans is spread out on both sides of the huge river. Traffic on the river provides a major source of revenue for the city. The city takes its name from Philippe II, Duke of Orleans. He was the Regent of France when New Orleans was founded in 1718. The many cultures that made up New Orleans are still evident today. The city has many nicknames, but two of the most well known are The Big Easy'' and The Crescent City''. New Orleans continues to have diversity in many areas. The Cuisine, Music, the annual Mardi Gras celebration just before Lent begins and architecture are what gives New Orleans its unique atmosphere. The French Quarter is the most famous area of New Orleans and where many visitors spend their time. It also provides some free places to explore. The St. Louis Cathedral is one of these. It has been raised to Basilica status in the Catholic Church. There have been three churches actually built on this site. The first one was in 1718. This church is the oldest continuously run church in the United States. St. Louis Cathedral is in the French Quarter at 615 Pere Antoine Alley, New Orleans. This structure is one of the most recognizable in all of New Orleans. The Cathedral was rebuilt in 1850 because most of the third church that was built there was non- existent. Jackson Square is directly across the street from the St. Louis Cathedral as is the Mississippi River. The structure can be seen often as this area is used for frequent news reporting and political events. On one side of the church is the Cabildo and the Presbytere is on the other. While there is not much of the original Spanish Architecture left from the original designs, the cathedral has survived many hurricanes and a bombing in 1909. When people visit they can see St. Anthony's Garden and attend Mass. The church has a Saturday Mass at 5:00 pm and two Sunday Masses at 9:00 am and 11:00 am. Weekday Mass is scheduled at 7:30 am. The Sacrament of Penance is held on Saturdays from 4:00 to 4:45 pm. St. Louis Cathedral Academy accepts students from pre-k through seventh grade. A gift shop is available for people wishing to buy religious medals, rosaries and other gifts. When staying in the area there are many hotels located in the French Quarter. The French Quarter Suites Hotel, the Monteleone Hotel and brand name establishments such as the Omni, Loews, Westin and Hilton offer many different styles of accommodations. The food that New Orleans is famous for includes Creole and Cajun cuisine. The beignets, crawfish, etouffee, jambalaya and gumbo are staples in the diet of the locals and tourists. Pralines are a confection made from sugars, butter, cream and pecans. The cafy au lait complements every meal and is made up of chicory and coffee blended together."
"St. Pierre Hotel New Orleans","Louisiana","St. Pierre Hotel New Orleans","New Orleans has many buildings which date back to the 17th and 18th centuries. One of these buildings has been renovated and turned into the St. Pierre Hotel. The restoration left the building with its 17 and 18 century roots. There are guest rooms with balconies, tropical courtyards, and two swimming pools as part of the hotel. The rooms each have their own decor to make them different for the guests.

The breakfast is set up in the New Orleans Jazz Museum Breakfast Room. It has old Creole ramparts providing tourists with ambience, history, and a part of Old New Orleans. Free parking, high speed wireless internet, and business services are available at the hotel. Before launching into the guest room amenities it should be mentioned that the hotel is a collection of 18th century cottages which are dated to the 1780's. One building of the hotel was the Gabriel Peyroux House, a Frenchman. The house was actually erected on Bayou Road near a plantation, but the family eventually moved the whole building to its current location. The breakfast area was set up as a museum because the hotel is just steps away from the Legendary Birthplace of Jazz which is the Congo Square in Louis Armstrong Park. It was a place that many would gather to hear music. The museum officially opened in 1961 as part of the hotel. Another anecdote is that Tennessee Williams lived at 1014 Dumaine Street just across from the hotel. He stopped in the hotel several times. Hotel St. Pierre is part of the French Quarter Inns. It has 74 guest rooms. Cottages and townhouses were converted to make the inn. The rooms have double beds or king size beds depending on whether one asks for a suite.

"Storyville District, New Orleans","Louisiana","Storyville District, New Orleans","The city of New Orleans was not unlike many cities that had a large population of ladies of the evening''. They may have been one of the few big cities that provided them with their own area of the town. Storyville was where the prostitutes lived from 1897 until the forced closure of the district by the federal government in 1917. They were ordered to shutter their doors after the beginning of World War I when it was decreed that a brothel couldn't be within five miles of a military base. This area got its name from the alderman that provided the legislation for the district. His name was Sidney Story, and that is where the name Storyville District was derived. The streets that surrounded Storyville were to become very well known, but not necessarily for prostitution. Iberville, St. Louis, Robertson and the most famous Basin Street were all within this district. This area is two blocks from the French Quarter. The Iberville Housing Projects take up most of the area where Storyville once was. The original idea behind the district was so that the city would have the ladies in one area which would make monitoring and regulating easier. The city looked at the legalized German and Dutch red light districts to help them set up their own. There were books called blue books'' that listed the houses, the services available, prices and the stock'' as the girls were known that each house had. Many of the establishments on Basin Street were mansions. There was a railway station in close proximity to the red light district and Storyville became one of the attractions of the city. While jazz was played in the better houses it did not originate in Storyville. Many of the more expensive brothels would hire a piano player or a band. After the government closed down Storyville it was still considered a place for entertainment. During prohibition there were cabarets, speakeasies, restaurants and gambling establishments. Prostitution was still available as well, but police did raid these houses. The buildings became rundown and most were demolished in the 1930's. The mansions of Basin Street were part of the destruction, and in an effort to rid the city of the districts reputation they even changed the name of the street from Basin to North Saratoga. Today it bears the name of Basin Street once again. Many famous musicians performed in the Storyville District. Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Noone and Joe King'' Oliver are just some of the names. This thirty eight block parcel has the Iberville Housing Projects on it and something else as well. Ralph Brennan, a well known restaurateur, along with George Wein, jazz musician, Quint Davis, Producer/Director and Arthur Davis, architect opened the Storyville District entertainment complex. There is 12,000 square feet with different rooms that provide live entertainment from the afternoon into the evening. There is a restaurant that serves some of the greatest New Orleans cuisine while guests listen to traditional jazz music."
"T.R.E.E. House","Louisiana","T.R.E.E. House, Alexandria, LA","Alexandria is in Rapides Parish in Louisiana. It sits on the south bank of the Red River south of Shreveport and Bossier City. Alexandria began as an outpost for the Spanish. It was known for is unsavory residents. The city was founded by Alexander Fulton and Thomas Harris Maddox. In 1785 they received a land grant from Spain. In 1805 they finally decided to lay a grid for the town, naming it after Alexander. In 1818 the town was incorporated. The city has numerous annual events such as Mardi Gras, Cenlabration and RiverFest. There are museums such as the Alexandria Museum of Art and the Louisiana History Museum.

The museum offers hands on exhibits and innovative learning programs for children. Education, family, and discovery are all part of the design for the museum. Children aged 4 to 12 will get the most out of the museum experience. The museum was started in 1998 by parents who wanted a museum their children could enjoy. By seeking funding through the government the parents were able to build the museum. It took two years for it to become open. Several schools, day cares, and other groups sought the museum. They had 7,000 visitors in one year, which has since increased. The building is 7800 square feet right now, but there are plans to add on 1528 square feet for more exhibits. During the summer months the museum has a number of programs for children. There are camps throughout the summer as well as kite building exercises, science day, etc. The exhibits include a Whisper Tube which is where children can whisper into a tube to experience how sound travels. The Cabrini Clinic is all about a doctor's office in which lab coats, x- rays, and medical tools are on display. The giant pin screen helps children learn anatomy, by looking at body parts on the screen. The Antique fire truck allows children to climb aboard, playing with levels and the mechanics of the truck. Shadow room is a place to create different shadows. The Rockwell Railroad display teaches the history of the railroad, how it helped expand trade in Louisiana, and what is happening with it today.

"The Bluffs on Thompson Creek, St. Francisville, Louisiana - A Golf Course That's Architecturally Unlike Anything Else in America, According to Golf Digest","Louisiana","The Bluffs on Thompson Creek, St. Francisville, Louisiana - A Golf Course That's Architecturally Unlike Anything Else in America, According to Golf Digest","The Bluffs on Thompson Creek is a Signature Arnold Palmer-designed course that makes use of some diverse landscapes. Palmer was given complete freedom to route the golf course as he desired, and eight different routings were staked out and considered before the best 18 holes were discovered and finalized. Once the most dramatic holes were determined, only then was the surrounding residential community planned. The course is set amid the Felicianna countryside, and begins and ends atop the high bluffs along Thompson Creek. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,154 yards from the longest tees with a USGA rating of 74.6 and a slope rating of 143 on Bermuda grass, making for a challenging round. Along the way, the course plays through thick forests of hardwood trees and pines, into hollows, over hills, off bluffs, and even to a green located adjacent to a white-sand beach, making for a highly scenic venue. The course opened in 1988 and is said to exude an atmosphere of great maturity, thanks to its natural contours and the large old trees that line its fairways. The views are also said to be dramatic, with elevation changes as great as 50 feet on a single shot, which is unusual in Southern Louisiana. The greens tend to be large and multi-tiered, which adds to the course difficulty and makes three-putts fairly common. Since opening, the course has received a number of awards, honors and raves. Golf Digest ranked it as the #2 course in the state in 2007, and listed it at #80 in the country among all golf courses in the same year. The magazine also had this to say: If any Louisiana course comes close to the ambiance and appeal of a laid-back resort like North Carolina's Pinehurst, it's The Bluffs on Thompson Creek. Architecturally, there's nothing quite like it anywhere else in America, which makes it worth the journey.'' Golfweek ranked The Bluffs even higher, naming it the #1 course in the state for Best Places You Can Play'' in 2006, as well as ranking it at #61 among America's Best Residential Golf Courses.'' GOLF Magazine ranked it higher still, 34th among the Top 100 Courses You Can Play in the U.S.'' The Bluffs has also hosted a number of championships, including the Louisiansa State Championships, the Southeastern Conference Golf Championship, United States Senior Challenge, and several other prestigious events since its opening in 1988. Practice facilities at The Bluffs include a driving range and putting green. The Bluffs also has a distinctive, plantation-style clubhouse, which specializes in banquets and large gatherings. The Clubhouse at The Bluffs overlooks the stunning 9th hole and has a Grill that serves casual luncheon fare and cocktails, while the Dining Room features more elegant evening fare with Louisiana cuisine with a French influence, including fresh seafood and prime steak specialties. In addition to golf, the resort also features swimming and tennis."

"The Presbytere, New Orleans","Louisiana","The Presbytere, New Orleans","The Presbytere is part of the Louisiana State Museum complex. Many of the buildings in this complex date back to the 1700's. The historical buildings that make up this complex are the Cabildo, St. Louis Cathedral, The Presbytere, the 1850's House and the Old US Mint. The Presbytere and the Cabildo were designed to look alike. The Presbytere was built on a religious site, that of the Capuchin monks. The original name was the Casa Curial or Ecclesiastical House. The money for the Cabildo, St. Louis Cathedral and the Presbytere was given by Don Andres Almonester y Roxas. At the time it was built there was only one story and it wasn't until 1813 that the second story was added. It was at this time that the Wardens of the Cathedral took responsibility for the building. When it was first constructed the Presbytere was a commercial building. It was in 1834 that the Presbytere was used as a courthouse. While the main architecture is Spanish the roof that was added in 1847 was a French mansard style. The Presbytere along with the Cabildo became a part of the museum complex in 1911. The building was listed a National Historic Landmark in 1970. There is a permanent exhibit of the New Orleans Mardi Gras event.

"TPC Louisiana","Louisiana","TPC Louisiana, Avondale, Louisiana - A Pete Dye PGA Tour Course in the Wetlands of Louisiana","The TPC Louisiana Golf Course can be found on 250 acres of reclaimed wetlands across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. As a TPC course, it is owned and operated by the PGA Tour and hosts the Zurich Classic each year, while operating according to the highest standards within the golf industry. The 18-hole course plays to par-72 and 7,010 yards from the Dye'' tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 135. It has another set of PGA Tour'' tees that once upon a time bumped the yardage up to 7,520, but it was shortened in 2007 to 7,341 yards. Even so, golfers must get staff approval in order to play from the PGA Tour tees. Situated on former wetlands, the course features gently rolling hills, five ponds, and stately cypress and oak tree stands, making for a picturesque setting. There are also 103 sand bunkers, and 69 of those are pot bunkers that add to the challenge. The course also features the usual Pete Dye design elements, including sprawling waste areas and water hazards. The course plays on Bermuda grass fairways that are annually over-seeded with Rye. The greens feature Miniverde Bermuda grass which plays exceptionally true and fast, with an average green speed of 10 on the stimpmeter. To put that in context, think U.S. Open green speeds. The course features a number of especially noteworthy holes, including three holes on the front nine known as the triangle of doom.'' The third hole in the triangle is a long par-4, and the most difficult on the course, that calls for a long, straight drive to avoid the hazard on the left. The second shot then dramatically doglegs 90 degrees to the left, and players must also contend with conditions that dictate club selection. The finishing hole is also one of the most challenging and dramatic on the course, even after being reworked by Dye. The hole was shortened and the massive skyscraper'' bunker that guards the left side of the fairway has been reshaped. Dye also added some mounding around the green and expanded the bunkers to make laying up even more challenging. And, of course, there's the huge water hazard on the right that runs the length of the hole, making for some tough decisions and great drama at the end of the course. The course has received a number of accolades since opening in 2004, including being named the No. 4 Best Upscale Public Golf Course'' by Golf Digest when the course made its debut. The course is a Pete Dye design, and PGA Tour players Steve Elkington and Kelly Gibson also served as player consultants. Practice facilities at TPC Louisiana include 15 acres that allow for full swing and short game practice. Golf lessons are also available, including the PGA Tour Golf Academy which comes to the course for one week of personalized golf instruction every year. The course also features a 24,000-square-foot antebellum-style clubhouse that includes a golf shop with a selection of equipment, clothing and accessories that is said to be unparalleled by any other golf shop in the state. Merchandise includes PGA Tour, Zurich Classic, and TPC Louisiana products, as well as collegiate apparel. For dining and drinks, the TPC Grille features a full bar, expansive patio and New Orleans-style cuisine."
"Vermilionville","Louisiana","Vermilionville, Lafayette, LA","Vermilionville is part of the Bayou Vermilion District in Lafayette Parish Louisiana. The district consists of administrative offices, bayou operations, and Vermilionville. It was created in 1984. Vermilionville is a folk and heritage park. The location is 300 Fisher Road. The idea of the entire district was to create a place that could improve the quality of the water as well as to provide a recreational area with culture preservation in mind. The Bayou Vermilion was the most polluted waterway in Louisiana until the district began. In the last 20 years pollution has been reduced. At Vermilionville residents and tourists are able to gather information and take seminars and workshops to find out more about the natural resources of Louisiana and how to protect them. The other side of the Vermilionville project is to ensure culture is not lost. Louisiana has a high concentration of Cajun and Creole heritage. There are also Acadiana cultures which date to the 1765 and 1890's. Vermilionville has a historical village, with 18 buildings all original. Traditional arts and crafts and music are shared in the village. A restaurant, gift shop, and art gallery provide more for those visiting Vermilionville. Since the location is that of a bayou there are plants and trees to view via trails or boat tours. The boat tours are often with canoes or swamp boats which cut down on pollution. Wildlife is prevalent at the village. Alligators, several bird species, and other reptiles can be seen. There are four projects going on at Vermilionville. The first is the Acadian Heritage Quilt Squares project. A community organization comes to Vermilionville to create quilt squares. A number of cultures are part of this activity. The squares have to be 9 by 9 inches depicting something of the Acadian culture. A tapestry is then created so others may view the intricate craftsmanship. The Fait a la Main is an Art creation. The project is one in which a Bousillage Fireplace and Chimney building is going to be constructed. Those who have a hand in building homes are allowed to take part in the creation of this Bousillage. Mud and Spanish moss are used to make it historically relevant. The third event is the Bateau and Palmetto Hut additions. A master boat builder is helping to construct the additions so that they are historically accurate. Individuals are allowed to take part or just come and watch the construction with the free event day. The fourth project is the Palmetto hut in which the construction techniques date to the 1840's. The hut is meant to be a replication of a Houma Indian structure. Besides these projects which are on going the park offers events during the year as well as tours. Park hours and admission were not listed on the official site. Another interesting part about Vermilionville is the classes and camps offered to guests. There is a cooking school in which students can learn Cajun and Creole cuisine. They will also learn techniques used in the past for how to cook."

This street was teeming with prosperity during the nineteenth century when the ships would come into the Port of New Orleans. While the port is still a major shipping area the buildings were abandoned when commerce and trade practices changed. Containers replaced the need for warehouses so the historical old buildings were left empty. There was a resurgence of the neighborhood in the 1970's when the Contemporary Arts Center opened. This was a 10,000 square foot area that displays art plus performances of music, dance and theater. The old warehouses were the perfect place to create and present the artist's work.
