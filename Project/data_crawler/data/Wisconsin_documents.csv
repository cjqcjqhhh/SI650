"A Museum for Woodworking Enthusiasts","Wisconsin","A Museum for Woodworking Enthusiasts","The Museum of Woodcarving is an amazing compilation of biblical history that visitors will find both breathtaking and astonishing. Located just a half mile from the small town of Shell Lake, Wisconsin this divinely inspired collection of handcrafted, wooden figurines will simply astound anyone who happens to stumble across this small but well put together travel through biblical times. The display of wooden biblical motivated figures was handcrafted by wood-crafter Joseph T. Barta. Mr. Barta's museum opened in 1951. He was a teacher in Spooner, Wisconsin in the 1940's. Mr. Barta developed this wide array of wood figures, depicting many well read biblical events, over a period of 15 years. As his niece, Maria McKay, states, You feel like you're walking through a wooden Bible. This large collection of woodcarvings, actually, the largest collection in the world created by one person, consists of 100 life sized wood carvings as well as 400 miniatures. The construction of the religious scenes is made of ponderosa and sugar pine which are laminated together. This tedious form of craftsmanship is obvious when one closely examines the minute details depicted in each religious scene. Each piece although showing a rough finish, displays each labor intensive chisel stroke of the craftsman. Joseph Barta's museum opened in 1951. He was a teacher in Spooner, Wisconsin in the 1940's. Incredibly, Mr. Barta even developed his own glue for fastening the pieces together on many of the carvings. This no frills museum is clean and if not somewhat bleak. The wood carvings are carefully displayed on gray wall to wall carpeting with plain white walls in the background. Each display is dimly illuminated by ceiling track lighting. Each scene is displayed in the chronological order as they appear in the Bible.  Starting with Adam and Eve being banished from the Garden of Eden, the tour through the museum takes visitors from one epic biblical occurrence to the next. One of the most chilling, if not gruesome, carvings is that of Judas hanging from a rope. The carving of Judas swinging overhead is sure to send chills up the spines of visitors as they roam through the museum. Some very interesting events led to some of Mr. Barta's wood carvings. Mr. Barta claimed to have had a series of revelations that led to some if not all of his wood carving endeavors. It is said that he had dreams in which God spoke to him and advised him how to go about his works. On his carving of the Last Supper, Mr. Barta is said to have heard a voice with a German inflection giving him the inspiration to create this well known biblical scene. The Last Supper carving took Barta over four years to complete. Other stimulation was said to have come from a vision of Mary, Queen of the Universe. The entire museum was relocated to Florida for a time, but has since been reestablished back where it began in Shell Lake. Joseph Barta died at the age of 68 in 1972."

"Adventure Attraction Near the Dells","Wisconsin","Adventure Attraction Near the Dells","Most people consider adventures in the Wisconsin Dells to be several back-to-back rounds of miniature golf, or conquering one of the many water thrill rides on the city's main strip. While this may be the average visitors cup of tea, there is a location in the Dells that offers adventures beyond the wildest dresms of some people. Vertical Illusions is an adventure experience that offers activities like winter sports, rocking climbing and paddling, and kayaking and rock climbing excursions. This place is sure to get the adrenaline going for those who decide to take on one of these great adventures. Easton Dreher, the founder of Vertical Illusions designed the concept for a school project during his junior year in college at Northern Michigan Univeristy. During his senior year he put his plan into action, driving back and forth between Michigan and the Dells, launching and building his business. He chose the Dells because the city is not only a tourist attraction, it makes conservation and sustainability part of its agenda. The cliffs throughout the area make for perfec trock claiming facades, and may expose climbers to nesting raptors, bat colonies, and rare plants. Climbers love being exposed to the natural environment and breathtaking views in the central Wisconsin location. Dreher chose the name Vertical Illusions as a way of paying homage to the rock formations that are frequently found in this area. Many of these are similar to the formations found right in the actual Dells. He wanted those visiting his adventure center to focus on nature and let the rat race of the world go. His intention was to bring together diverse groups of people who will bond over their shared adventure experience. He saw connections in nature that he felt he could also find among people who visited Vertical Illusions. The mission of the center is ... to guide a person into a lifestyle by using fun adventures to `Live Your World''' It was Dreher's experiences in Europe that opened his mind to an idea such as this. He moved throughout hostels during his trip, meeting other young people and experiences a fulfilling life that he wanted tob bring to others once he returned to the Midwest. His ultimate intention is to help future generations escape consumerism and pharmaceuticals, and focus on the healing nature can provide. Vertical Illusions was originally a van, a trailer, and five kayaks. Dreher received a great deal of help from family and friends and he was quickly able to grow his Dell's business. People from across the country came for these adventure experiences, and willingly left behind the stresses of their regular lives for the adrenaline boosting stresses or rock climbing , rafting, and kayaking. Dreher intends to continue to grow and plans to build outdoor lighting so climbers can continue their climbs after the sun sets. There are also numerous downhill moutain bike trails in store, as well as an ice park. Vertical Horizons is an attraction that offers visitors a deeper purpose. Consider sharing an experience with our family and friends that you will never forget."
"Affordable Destination for Families","Wisconsin","Affordable Destination for Families","With the popularity of over the park, expensive amusement parks, a lot of families are looking for a more affordable option that is low-key, but just as much fun for the kids. The Bay Beach Amusement Park in Green Bay may be this option. The park began in 1892 when a man named Mitchell Nejedlo fell in love with the area and purchased a strip of land nearby. He created a private beach resort with he named Bay View Beach. There, he built a dance hall and bathhouse, and his intention was to sell summer residences to visitors. Getting to Bay View Beach was tough, and the area, like much of Wisconsin, suffered from a mosquito problem. This hindered his efforts to attract visitors and buyers. In 1902, Nejedlo teamed up with a boat captain and they bought a 400 passenger boat that would transport people from the Walnut Street Bridge to the beach. The destination grew in popularity and was visited by swimmers and bathhouse visitors. People would actually rent swimsuits for a dime, wanting so badly to participate in the seashore fun. In 1901, the first roller coaster was built. It was replaced in 1929, but was later dismantled in the 1930's, due to insurance issues. It was shortly after the turn of the century that the beach began to look more like an amusement park than just a swimming destination. Modeling the popularity of Coney Island in New York, the park included Shoot-the-Chutes, a Merry-Go-Round, and concessions. The park's ownership changed hands a few times, and they experienced numerous obstacles on their way to what they are today. The dance halls were the most popular feature of the park for a period and it became a destination for Green Bay teens during the 1930's and 1940's. Today, the park sits on over 40 acres of land and includes 16 rides, seven shelters, restrooms, gaming areas, and places to picnic. The City of Green Bay maintains the park and prides itself on keeping it a popular destination for children, teens, and adults. Rides include boats, the Granny Bugs, the Ladybugs, Jeeps, Racecars, and the Skyfighter for the littlest members of your group. Old kids and adults can enjoy more thrilling rides like slides, bumper cars, the helicopter, the Ferris wheel, the Scrambler, a Merry Go Round, the Tilt a Whirl, and plenty more. There are live pony rides available for children who would like to enjoy a ride on a horse. The shelter, picnic area, and dance hall are all available for rental. A popular destination in the park after a long day of thrill rides is the concession stand. Offering cotton candy, popcorn, slushies, nachos, soda, and ice cream, it is an affordable way to enjoy a snack. The main pavilion offers more food choices including more substantial treats like brats, hamburgers, hot dogs, and fries. The building provides a great back drop for your meal. What families love most about Bay Beach is its affordability. Parking and admission are both free, and tickets are available on the per ride basis. Tickets cost a quarter, and most rides require only one or two tickets. Bay Beach is a great place for the whole family."

"Authentic Movie House in Milwaukee","Wisconsin","Authentic Movie House in Milwaukee","This three screen theater has been operated by Landmark Theaters for over 30 years. The building was built in 1927 and has long been an important part of the Milwaukee landscape. It is located about a mile north of the downtown area, five blocks west of Lake Michigan. Surrounded by quircky shops, alternative health care providers, and inexpensive one-room apartments, the theater is a fixture in Milwaukee's eclectic Eastside neighbhorhood. On Fridays and Saturday before the start of the evening movies, the Kimball Theatre Pipe Organ can be heard to introduce the film, just as it did decades ago. This is the third largest pipe organ of its kind in the entire world. In 2009, the theatre opened its own bar that servces alcohol in addition to typical movie theatre concessions. This was more than likely done in an effort to compete with another popular local theatre, The Rosebud. Movie goers are welcome to bring their food and beverages into the theater auditorium, and they can enjoy items before, during, and after the show. When the theater opened just before the Great Depression, it featured two minaret towers, six Buddhas, three stained glass chandeliers, and several hand drawn murals. There were also a bevy of elephants in sculpture and two dimensional art, as well as ornate draperies. Restoration has worked to keep as much of the original flavor of the theater intact as possible. The Oriental is thought to be the only movie theater built to reflect East Indian Dycor. The Oriental has always shown a unique batch of movies and rarely has typical Hollywood blockbusters on its marquee. They often share classics and cult movies with the public, as well as a variety of independent films, often recognized at various film festivals. Foreign films, documentaries, art-house flicks, and live performances are also part of the Oriental's docket. The Milwaukee rock band the Violent Femmes got their start at the Oriental when The Pretenders needed a fill-in opening act. They invited the band from the sidewalk in front of the theatre to perform and thus was launched a relatively popular alternative act. Currently, the Oriental offers no live performances. In 1998, the theater was turned into a triplex, adding two additional theaters under the balcony area. The Oriental is currently the world record holder for longest continuous running film and every second Saturday of the month at midnight features an interactive performance of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. There is a live performance of the movie, as usually occurs at showing around the country, by the Sensual Dreams cast of performers. Those who have never visited the Oriental are encouraged to attend for a showing of this cult classic. Come prepared for off-color fun, gallows humor, and adult fun, and go home feeling like a kid again. The theater is used as a part of the annual Milwaukee film fesitval. The festival took a hiatus, but returned in 2009, smaller, more organized, and offering the same low budget entertainment festival patrons have come to adore. The Oriental Theater in Milwaukee is a part of the city's eclectic history."

"First House Lit by Hydro","Wisconsin","First House Lit by Hydro","While hydroelectricity may seem like the green wave of the future, using water for power has been happening for centuries. The Hearthstone Historic House was the first lit by Edison's hydroelectric station. It was created in 1882, and along with the Appleton Paper Company and the Kimberly-Clark Paper Mill, was run solely through the use of water power. There was one other location where this was the case, in New York City. The light switches and electroliers are still being used in the home. Some believe this is the only remaining example of the original structure used at the dawn of the electrical age. The home itself was designed by William Walters, a well known architect in the Fox Valley. He designed several buildings throughout the Fox Cities, and in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The Rogers family occupied the house for over a decade. The house was sold several times and in the 1930's became a restaurant called The Hearthstone. In the mid-1980's, the City of Appleton contemplated destroying the building, but a group of citizens worked to raise the funds to buy the property. The group created the Friends of the Hearthstone, Inc. They later opened the museum in effort to share the history of Edison's accomplishments. Today, the house and museum feature an adventure center that teaches kids about the development and usage of electricity. Families will love the experience to understand how something they use on the daily basis works. You will have the opportunity to use an Edison light switch, or attempt to generate the electricity to run an electric trolley model. This is a great place for exploration and teaches kids about science, without boring them with text books and typical science experiments. The Hearthstone features a gift shop where you can find unique items for just about everyone in your life. There are plenty of items for those who are interested in electricity, but there are also plenty of items for those who just use electricity without thinking about it. There are Victorian style lamps, light bulbs, and handmade jewelry. Kids will love the games, science kits, and desk items that reflect the development of electricity. Also featured are postcards, mugs, shirts, and pens. The town of Appleton features a variety of attractions, shops, and restaurants. There are elegant bed and breakfasts where you can relax and unwind, feeling as if you have traveled back in time to a simpler locale. Nearby are also casual dining restaurants, lounges and bars, and convention space at some of the local hotels. The Kimberly-Clark company still operates in the town and provides employment for many of the area residents. Appleton is a great town for a weekend getaway, or a great place to host an event if you are based in the Milwaukee or Madison metropolitan area. Whether you are vacationing in Wisconsin and you want to return home with unique souvenirs, or this is your hometown and you are looking for a fun way to spend an afternoon, head to this science-filled historic destination."

It is set in a 13,000 square foot labrynth called the Quadrasphers. Visitors are tasked with finding glimmers and releasing the captured wizards. Glimmers are collected by answering trivia questions put to you by dragons. The riddles are a mixture of simple, unusual, and hiden. There are also physical passageways and hidden traps and entrances. Havoc is your enemy and he will do whatever he can to ensure the wizards are not freed. The quest takes 90 minutes to complete. You may not finish, but you are given a 90-minute limit. It is a walk up attraction, unless you are planning to visit with a group of larger than 15 people.

The prize for completing the quest, besides bragging rights among your friends and family, is a discount in the Wizard Quest gift shop. When questers finish their journey they can visit the shop for apparel and souvenirs from their adventure.

"Home of the Beloit Snappers","Wisconsin","Home of the Beloit Snappers","Few things are as charming as a simple minor league ballpark. Lacking the elaborate sound systems and high tech scoreboards, they rely on only the sights and sounds of the game to create a feeling of excitement and belonging. This is the case with Pohlman Field, home of the Beloit Snappers. The Snappers are a community owned team, which keeps them in this old-fashioned, slightly run down park. It was built in the early 1980's, and its age is beginning to show. Seating is on metal benches and there are only a few hundred box seats. These are made of molded plastic, and not fold down seating. The box section is located directly behind home plate. While other minor league parks are investing in their stadiums and creating tiny replicas of their Major League brethren, this park remains true to its roots. The few renovations that have taken place have been in the office building and the right field deck. The concession area is located behind the grandstand section and features the usual items you would expect to find at a ballpark, along with Wisconsin fare like brats, curds, and something called cheddarwursts. Basically a brat stuffed with cheese, it may stop your heart, but you will enjoy the experience. Prices are reasonable for ballpark food and most visitors at the stadium report they are happy with the taste and presentation of the food. The Snappers have a team store located behind home plate. Kids and adults alike will love grabbing a souvenir or scorebook before the game. Visitors to the park are impressed with the crowd. As ballparks become more social gatherings and party spots than game watching venues, this park is an exception. The crowd is reportedly more mature and knows the game. The team mascot is Snappy and moves around the park entertaining the children. The community feel is what most Snapper fans love about the park. It is a not for profit organization, so there is little concern the team would move elsewhere. While some of the players and coaches may yearn for an updated ballpark, especially after traveling to other sites nearby, the fact remains they are working in the minor leagues. They have a ways to go before they are dressing in a state of the art facility like Miller Park. The lower grade facilities in minor league ballparks help to motivate the players and encourage them to work on moving up through an organization. Minor league ballparks possess a special charm. With Major League tickets costing a fortune to visit and enjoy these days, a lot of children are falling in love with the game at these tiny mecas. In the long run, they will appreciate the game much more when the first see it without all of the glitz and glam that folks have come to expect from the big leagues. In Beloit, the focus is on the game and the team, just as it should be throughout all of baseball."
"Home of the Wisconsin Badgers","Wisconsin","Home of the Wisconsin Badgers","The Kohl Center may be the most popular destination in Madison once the football season ends. This is the site of where the Badgers men's and women's basketball teams play, as well as the home of other University Sports and various entertainment events. Other sports include ice hockey and wrestling. Buying tickets is a simple as it is if you were purchasing tickets for an entertainment venue or concert. Just locate the event on the website you wish to attend and purchase the tickets. There is even a link for student tickets, so you never have to worry about paying more than your usual fee just because you are buying online. The Fan Center on the website lists the upcoming promotions at each game. Games often include magnets, posters, and other giveaways for fans, just as NBA or other professional sports league event would. This is a great chance to catch a game and leave with a free souvenir. The Kohl Center was opened in 1998 and has experienced a great deal of excitement in its relatively short life. Many of the features in the arena were designed in accordance with requests from UW coaches. Located on the southeast side of the campus, the center features a practice area, study area, and competition area all in one place. It is also home to the UW coaching offices. The building is named for United States Senator Herb Kohl who graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1956. He donated $25 million to the creation of the Kohl Center so when it was completed, it was named for him and his monetary contribution. The center seats over 17,000 people for basketball games, including the lower seating bowl and the two balconies. There are no overhanging balconies which means fans are closer to the action on the court. Seating is slightly less for hockey and concerts. One of the features coaches and student athletes were happy about was the increased space in the locker rooms. There are several locker room areas for instances when there are tournaments. The space is over 2,000 square feet in size and has been designed with an eye toward the needs of student athletes. Teams are able to meat, socialize, and study, all in the locker room area. There is also a lounge area with videos, computers, a sound system, and a study room. The Practice Pavilion is home to three full-size courts used for practice and available for other events. There are sometimes pre-game booster events held in these locations for socializing or raising money. While University of Wisconsin basketball games would probably not have an issue attracting attendees to their games, it is good to know they have a state of the art facility in which to play. This provides fans with a comfortable venue to watch a game or event, and it ensure players have the best that is available when it comes to their athletic program. The next time you are planning a trip to Madison, consider catching a game or event at the Kohl Center."

"Indoor Water and Play Area","Wisconsin","Indoor Water and Play Area","Wiley's Woods is an attraction in the Great Wolf Lodge Resort in the Wisconsin Dells. It is a combination play area and game. The object is to race through the structure gathering plastic balls and earning points for your team. Throughout the structure are various games, and kids are provided with a great opportunity to burn off some energy. The cost is about $10 per person, unless you are staying at the Lodge. Lodge guests are entitled to free admission to the park. A lot of parents think this is a good attraction because they can interact with their children. A lot of the indoor water and amusement play areas are designed strictly for young children. Parents are tasked with sitting beside the structure ensuring their children do not escape without supervision. But with Wiley's Woods, parents can jump right in and have fun with their kids. Hours can pass while you are enjoying this play structure. There are slides that reach four stories, so there are som minor thrills involved with this attraction, too. Several visitors to the park suggest it is probably best suited for Lodge guests. Aside from being entitled to free admission, guests are also not required to wait in the ticketing line. This sometimes results in visitors waiting in several lines, not realizing tickets are not required for guests. Guests are also able to earn tickets during their play, a benefit to which visitors are not entitled. Another concern expressed by parents is the size of the structure. While a huge play area is great for kids, it can be disconcerting for parents when kids disappear into the structure. There are numerous exits and entrances into the structure, so you can never be sure where your child is playing, or if they are even still inside. Lost children are not an uncommon occurrence. Older children may understand they need to periodically check in with parents, or only exit through one part of the structure. However, young children may become so involved in what they are doing, they may find themselves disoriented and lost. If you are worried about not having access to the benefits that Great Wolf Lodge guests are entitled to, consider staying at the Lodge. While it will not remove the safety factor, it will give you a chance to experience the structure without paying an extra fee. The Lodge can be pricey, but it is much like an all-inclusive resort. Guests of the Lodge could make their trip to the Dells enjoyable without ever leaving the grounds. Water attractions, dining, and comfortable accomodations are all part of the Lodge experience. However, if you want your trip to the Dells to include the traditional Dells attractions, take time to visit the outdoor water parks, the miniature golf courses, and do not forget to ride the ducks. There are also a number of fun museums that are great if you have discounted tickets. If you are looking for a fun afternoon for the kids while in the Dells, consider visiting Wiley's Woods."

"Interesting Museum Exploring Wisconsin History","Wisconsin","Interesting Museum Exploring Wisconsin History","The Rollo Jamison Museum is located in the city of Platteville. The museum is dedicated to the residents of Platteville and southwest Wisconsin. Rollo Jamison was born in 1899 in the small town of Beetown, Wisconsin. Rollo was a collector from a very young age. He started his collecting around his family farm. His target of interest initially was Indian arrowheads. He developed an interest in history and in things used by people in pursuit of their everyday lifestyles. His focus was primarily items used by residents of southwest Wisconsin. It did not take long for his collection to grow to an enormous size and variety. A tour of the Rollo Jamison Museum will take you back in time to witness what life was like in Platteville and other areas of southwest Wisconsin at the beginning of the 20th century. Jamison was an interesting character. He left school when he was in the 4th grade to help support his family. He held a variety of jobs, but he could never get over his love of collecting things. He had a girlfriend, but when faced with the choice of getting married or continuing his collecting endeavors, he opted for the latter. At one point he opened an auto repair shop and maintained it for approximately 20 years. Eventually, he opened a tavern and began filling it with various collectables and talking about the history of southwest Wisconsin with whoever would listen. He began recording oral history interviews in 1947. Sometime in the early 1950's he sold his tavern and began building his museum. Unfortunately, he did not have the funding or support necessary to complete his dream. After much hard work and the formation of the Jamison Museum Association his lifelong collection was moved to Platteville. The museum officially opened in June, 1981. Rollo Jamison died 2 months later after witnessing his dream coming true. As a side note, the Rollo Jamison Museum is located right next door to The Mining Museum. This museum teaches the visitor how zinc and lead were mined in the 1800's. Daily tours of the underground exhibit are conducted to show how miners were able to collect the lead ore. Weather permitting; you can take a ride in an ore car pulled along by the museum's 1931 Whitcomb 5-ton mine locomotive. If you plan on taking the mine tour you will need to wear comfortable shoes and bring along a light jacket to ward off the underground chill. Be prepared to do a little exercise, because the trip down to the mine requires the visitor to climb about 90 steps. The main exhibits in the Mining Museum building are handicapped accessible. The price of admission covers the tours of both the Rollo Jamison and The Mining Museums. In addition to being a museum of local history of southwest Wisconsin, the museum hosts a number of special events throughout the year. The Winter Toy Train Exhibit, the annual Christmas exhibit, and the Jamison Museum Association Annual Meeting and Program all serve to help link visitors to the past and see a glimpse of what life was like in the late 1800's and early 1900's."

"International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin","Wisconsin","International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin","The International Crane Foundation (ICF,) located at E-11376 Shady Lane Road in Baraboo, Wisconsin, was established in 1973 on a horse farm by Ron Sauey and George Archibald. The two men met as graduate students at Cornell University two years earlier and were studying the behaviors and ecology of cranes. Upon studying the graceful birds, the men decided to found an organization committed to conservation and research. Today the foundation takes part in worldwide conservation efforts to preserve cranes and the wetland and grassland ecosystems they rely upon for survival. Committed to inspiring and providing knowledge, ICF helps educate people about reducing and eliminating threats to critical ecosystems. Black, grey and red-crowned, white-napped and black-necked cranes, as well as blue, hooded, sandhill, Sarus, Siberian, wattled, whooping, Brolga, Demoiselle and Eurasian cranes are among the birds featured at the park. While most nature and conservation organizations study and house a wide variety of species, ICF focuses its attention on cranes. Endangered species management, wetland ecology, habitat restoration and the importance of international cooperation, as these issues relate to the preservation of cranes at a global level is ICF's primary area of examination. The foundation's central objective is providing interactive education and conservation programs, aimed at fostering an understanding of cranes, as well as highlighting ways to preserve crane populations in numerous countries. Ecosystem protection and restoration initiatives are ways the organization works to generate awareness among scientists, government officials and the public about how critical wetlands and grasslands are to wildlife, as well as to people. Striving to further research efforts, ICF offers scientists, including conservationists and biologists, access to its grounds and bird collection. The organization also sponsors workshops and publications as a way to support social networking and preservation efforts. Education is the key to the survival of the crane. That is why the foundation opens its doors to visitors and provides outreach initiatives, such as the Annual Midwest Sandhill Crane Count program. ICF spreads the word about its site throughout the United States through films, representation in the national media and educational program offerings. An international component to ICF is its training in habitat management, restoration, ecology, captive management and propagation to colleagues in other countries. The center also sponsors international visits from foreign scientists, governments and leaders, as well as conservation centers in the U.S. and other countries. The relationship between wildlife, habitat and people is closely examined through ICF. Through its captive crane collection, the foundation can facilitate captive breeding and reintroduction of cranes into the wild. Endangered species management and education efforts also are made possible through keeping the captive population. ICF is open daily from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. April 15-Oct. 31. Reservations are not required for individuals or family groups. Tours are conducted each day at 10 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m. Memorial Day through Labor Day, and on weekends in April, May, September and October.

"Lambeau Field","Wisconsin","Lambeau Field - Green Bay, Wisconsin - Home of the Green Bay Packers","Lambeau Field, home of Wisconsin's Green Bay Packers, was the first stadium built for an NFL team's exclusive use. It serves as a year round historical center for the team, as well as a major tourist attraction for Packer fans across the globe. Nicknamed The Frozen Tundra'' after a game played between Green Bay and the Dallas Cowboys in the 1967 championship, Lambeau Field is boasted as featuring the only true retro-look in the entire league.'' When the doors opened in 1957, Lambeau Field was known as New City Stadium, having replaced the original City Stadium as the Packers' home turf. Later, in 1965, it went on to be renamed after Packers founder Curly Lambeau, who also played and coached for the team. Currently, the City of Green Bay and the Green Bay/Crown County Professional Football Stadium District own Lambeau field. Recently having undergone a series of renovations, which were completed in 2003, Lambeau field has a current seating capacity of 72,928 for football games, including 733 seats for those with disabilities. The updates, costing $295 million, added tons of new amenities to the stadium, originally costing $960,000 to build. Such additions included the addition of brighter lights to the playing field, which are eight times brighter the old stadium lights, as well as an expansion of the main concourse. This expansion makes it easier for fans to move about the stadium. The number of restrooms has also been increased, with 556 women's restrooms and 708 men's restrooms available to patrons. The field is comprised of DD GrassMaster, a hybrid of grass and artificial fibers helping to reinforce the surface. The opposing end zones are marked by brand new scoreboards by Daktronics Inc. The new boards are 41' x 162' in size, and each host full color LCD displays, each 27' x 48'. The Lee Remmel Press Box, resting right along the sidelines, has space for 250 people, plenty of room for the media covering an event. One of the main attractions of Lambeau Field is the Atrium. Located on the east side of the stadium, the Atrium is home to the Packers Hall of Fame, Curly's Pub, and the Packers Pro Shop (a two-story haven for Packer fans). The Atrium includes plenty of dining options, and is great for gatherings of all sorts, offering free wireless internet for those who need it. Outside the Atruim one will find the Robert E. Harlan Plaza, there are statues of Curly Lambeau and coach Vince Lombardi. Constructed of bronze, the statues are a towering 14' tall.

One such event, dubbed the Frozen Tundra Hockey Classic, was played in 2006 between college teams from Wisconsin and Ohio State. It was deemed a smashing success. For those looking to get Packers tickets, act now. The stadium has been sold-out since 1960, and on a season-ticket basis, at that."
"Landmark That Tells Temperature and Time","Wisconsin","Landmark That Tells Temperature and Time","Anyone who has spent any time in Milwaukee is familiar with the large, looming clock tower that looks out over the city and shares the time and the temperature. The Allen Bradley Clocktower is a Milwaukee landmark that has been in existance since 1962. The clock is a part of the Rockwell Automation Companies headquarters. The building actually feautres two towers, one for temperature and the taller one for time. The current temperature tower was originally a clock-only tower, but in the mid-1970's, this was converted to temperature and a taller tower was constructed with the clock faces. The clocktower stands at 283 feet and holds the Guiness World Record for the largest four-faced clock. The owners of the tower decided to not add chimes in order to allow the Big Ben Clocktower in England to continue to hold the world record for tallest chiming clocktower. The hour hands of the Allen Bradley clocktower are 15.8 feet high and they weight 490 pounds. Local Milwaukee residents used to refer to the clocktower as The Polish Moon, but over the years, the name has transitioned to reflect the changing neighbhorhood in which it resides. It is now occasionally called The Mexican Moon by local residents. The tower has frequently been used by mariners on Lake Michigan to navigate their journey. The tower can be seen from several miles away, allowing them to determine the direction and distance to landfall in Milwaukee. The tower is lit by several hundred high output flourescent tubes, requiring 34.6 kilowatts of electricity. During the oil crisis of 1973 and 1974 the tower went dark. Each face of the clock is independently operated by an individual gearbox. Each of the gearboxes runs with two motors. The Rockwell Automation company began in 1903 as the Allen-Bradley Company with an investment of $1,000 from Lynde Allen and Dr. Standton Allen. One of the first commercially manufactured Allen-Bradley brand of crane controllers was exhibited at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. The company continued to grow throughout the century, supplying machinery for both World Wars and a variety of other national defense missions. In 1969, Allen-Bradley opened a branch in England, which was the company's first internation business endeavor. In 1985, Rockwell International purchases Allen-Bradley, who was the North American leader in the industrial automation equipment market, for $1.651 billion. This was the largest business acquisition in Wisconsin's history at the time. Rockwell continued to buy companies and in 2001, became a public company traded on the New York Stock Exchange as ROK. Today, Rockwell continues to grow and remains one of Milwaukee's strongest and most well-known companies. Those visiting Milwaukee will want to take time to photograph the clocktower. It is easy to see from most areas of the city, but the southside offers the best vantage point. Those visiting Milwaukee are also encouraged to include the clocktower in any panoramic shots they may take of the Milwaukee skyline. The area surrounding the clocktower is relatively safe, and makes for a great evening of Mexican food and margaritas, following a quick observation of the clocktower."

"Learn About an Unusual Side of History","Wisconsin","Learn About an Unusual Side of History","The Dells is one of the most family oriented destinations in the United States. It is filled with water and theme parks, shows for children and their parents, quirky museums, and miniature golf courses. However, there is one location in the Dells that is not geared toward children, or adults who are squeamish or faint of heart. The Museum of Historic Torture Devices shows a side of history that may be unexpected to some. From technological displays showing the actual device to a the presentation of John Wayne Gacy's life, the museum features a variety of off-color, disturbing images that will be a thrill for macbre fans to view. Displays include The Inquisitor's Chair, The Rack, Thumbscrews, The Cucking Stool for dunking, The Breaking Wheel, the Iron Gag, The Heretic's Fork, and The Dreaded Chinese Death Cage. Throughout history these tools have been used to inflict pain on people for deserved and undeserved reasons. Curiousity gets the better of many people strolling by the museum and they head in to view the history of torture. Information about the devices include their uses, as well as information about the governments, armies, and churches that utilized them as a means to an end. There are a total of 40 shocking items that will intrigue those interested in how justice has been historically achieved. The Cucking Stool is one of the museum's most popular attractions. This device was used around 1215 and the literal meaning of the term is defecation chair.'' In some cases, the stool was used to dunk couples simultaneously. It was also a punishment device for dishonest brewers and bakers. The museum features meter parking directly in front of the museum, but some are lucky enough to find free parking within a few blocks of the museum. Exhibits are described in both English and Spanish, and the museum is sometimes described as intense.'' One of the most disturbing images includes information about the torture and burning of witches. Also shown are images from the Spanish Inquisition. Exhibits are featured from as far back as ancient times to modern day torture in 1973. The museum features mostly government sponsored torture making people realize how far some civilizations have come. Some actions used today that are considered torture by napve members of society stand in stark contrast to actual methods of torture used throughout history. The museum is reasonably priced, but is unsuitable for families with young children. Some teen visitors will be interested in the displays, but check out the website ahead of time to ensure they will want to go. Adults may take awhile reading the information included with each exhibit, so trips may take awhile. It is a step away from the usual fun-loving frolic for which the Dells is known. If you have had your fill of waterparks, cheap attractions, and silly exhibits, try a few hours at the Museum of Historic Torture Devices. Following your visit, you may just appreciate your time in history a bit more than before."
"Learn About and Sample Handcrafted Beer","Wisconsin","Learn About and Sample Handcrafted Beer","The Lakefront Brewery is a smaller option for those viting Milwaukee who are interested in touring a brewery. It was established in 1987 and is located right on the Milwaukee River. Various neighbhorhood bars and restaurants server Lakefront beers. Brothers Russ and Jim Klisch began brewing as a hobby after Russ gave Jim a book about brewing. Their sibling rivalry drove them to compete with one another and brewing, and before long, their friends and family were suggesting the brothers turn their hobby into profit. Afterall, brewing was in their blood since their grandfather worked for Schlitz brewing, and several family members had been employed by taverns and bars. Their brewing business started in the Riverwest area of Milwaukee, but they soon outgrew their original location. Lakefront is now located on North Commerce Street in Milwaukee and they brew over 11,000 barrels of beer each year. In 1992, this brewery relaunched one of the most popular brewing trends of today, not seen since prior to prohibition. Their Lakefront Cherry Beer was the first fruit beer in a long time and set the standard for other varieties of berry beers. They were also the first certified organic brewers in the United States when they began brewing their Lakefront Organic E.S.B. in 1996. Russ Klisch established a business relationship with Wisconsin farmers to brew the organic hops soon to be used in his organic beers. Another innovation of the brothers was to change the barley regulations for beer so they could sell gluten-free beer to people suffering from celiac disease. It is this cutting edge attitude of the Klisch brothers that has made Lakefront Brewery a success. In 1999, the brewery began using the large banquet space in the brewery as a family restaurant. They worked around their concerns of competing with area business selling their brew, and created a dining style that would not interfere with area pubs and bars. On Friday, the Palm Garden hosts a traditional Milwaukee fish fry. They also host various private events and weddings. Touring the brewery is a Milwaukee right of passage. Instead of allowing visitors a chance to sample beer only at the end of the tour, they provide beer at the start, and then walk tourists through the process of brewing their beer. The tour is more laid back than others in the area, and the tour guides are encouraged to relax, joke with, and education guests. An important part of the tour is the Milwaukee Brewer's baseball club's mascot's former Chalet. Those visiting Milwaukee will appreciate the display of the city's history and lore. Also part of the brewery are the lights in the Palm Garden. This detail was originally part of the Plankinton Hotel's never utilized beer garden. The brothers have renovated each of these lights and they are featured in their own beer garden. Lakefront is home to a variety of award winning beers including the Big Easy Lager, the Cream City Pale Ale, the Pumpkin Lager, the Snake Chaser, and New Grist, the gluten free beer. If you are headed to Milwaukee and you want to experience their rich brewing culture, consider a tour at the Lakefront Brewery."

Coors Light is the fourth best selling beer in the U.S. since 1978. Many find Coors to be flavorful. Miller Coors is in good company with Blue Moon Belgian White. Blue Moon is a soft beer. It doesn't have an aftertaste, and works for those who do not like the darker beers. The Belgian White came from the cloudy white appearance of the beer. Belgian White is a Belgium beer that has roots from 300 years ago. Adding it to Blue Moon has enhanced its taste. This beer was launched in 1995. Peroni Nastro Azzurro was imported from Rome. It is the number one brand in Italy and is currently found in 38 countries. Pilsner Urquell is another international success from Pilsen, Czech Republic. It was first made in 1842 with a golden color and light body. These are two other beers sold that are in the great list of beers, and though they are not Miller or Coors they fit right in. Miller High Life was created in 1903 as a lager. It has a darker appearance and rich taste that supposedly takes drinkers back to the High Life.'' George Killian's Irish Red is an Irish beer from Enniscorthy. The recipe was created in1864. It is an amber beer with a creamy head. Miller Coors has made a number of acquisitions over the years in order to sell popular beers. Like minds tend to create top beers like Henry Weinhard's Private Reserve, which includes a number of different beers that have been aged. There is a 37 step process to the brewing. Another on the beer list is the 1986 Milwaukee's Best Light. It offers a premium taste, according to the company. Miller and Coors have both refined their brewing process to make their beers some of the best in the U.S. They have also made sure that their beers are in some of the greatest beers of history."

He visited nearly 200 countries and traveled in search of unusual things that fascinated him. He began his professional career as a newspaper sports cartoonist and in 1918 compiled his first collection of odd facts. In 1929 a collection of these facts was made into a book that quickly became a best seller. Of all the lands to which he traveled, Ripley felt most comfortable in China. He became fascinated with the culture and the customers of the country. He sometimes traveled in unconventional ways including camel, horse, and donkey. The Ripley museums are a great way to freak out and amuse your family. The museums have a lot of practice and have been doing so for over 90 years. Each museum contains a variety of entertaining and astonishing facts from all across the world. Even the most cynical members of your group will find themselves mesmerized and mind boggled.

Between 5000 B.C and 500 A.D, Native Americans settled along the river, using the copper in the area to create tools. The area was rich in trade materials which the first Europeans and the Native Americans took advantage of. They hunted mink, otter, and beaver, and the outpost was a popular destination as people moved west. After Wisconsin was established in 1848, lumberjacks began to move into the area and cut down the large pine trees on the land. They drove the logs down the river to the quarry area. In 1932, Douglas County bought a 60 acre portion of the land and was gifted another portion of 65 acres. The county then gave this park area to the Town of Amnicon. The Civilian Conservation Corps developed the area and throughout the 1940's the park became a popular destination for families and nature lovers. The park grew to more than 150 acres, but was difficult to maintain and was returned to the country. The park was officially named in 1961, and has since grown to over 800 acres. On the grounds are waterfalls, rapids, and river banks, making it a exciting destination to hike and picnic. Hiking trails include footbridges and rocky shores. Visitors to the area enjoy learning about and exploring the Douglas Fault, a geological formation that was responsible for the creation of the waterfalls. Camping is permitted at the park and there are 36 sites that include on that is accessible for those with disabilities. Two sites are walk in and are located just 100-150 feet from the parking area. Most of the campgrounds are rustic and shaded by trees. It is a quiet area and electric hookups, dumping stations, and showers are not on the property. Three sets of vault toilets, but no flush toilets are available for guests of the campgrounds. Drinking water is available from two different faucets and fire wood is available on the honor system from the park office. Just a few miles east of the park on US Highway 2 is a gas station and store for those who need to stock up on supplies before or after their trip. The park is filled with wildlife, but park officials ask that visitors not feed the wildlife intentionally or accidentally. Campers should remember to keep coolers closed, food scraps put away in their vehicles, and do not eat in tents. This is both for the safety of the animals and the safety of park guests. The park is supported by a group of volunteers known as the Friends of Pattison and Amnicon Falls State Parks. This group of people helps maintain services in the parks and helps meet the needs of visitors. They also have fundraising drives to raise money for the parks. Their accomplishments have included the installation of the open shelter in the picnic area. They host events year round including Fall Colorama, Winter Funfest, and their June Open House. The group also services visitors with sales at the park of soda, t-shirts, postcards, and firewood. A state park with a rich history and interesting surroundings, visit Amnicon Falls State Park."

During the late 1920's, Father Matthias Wernerus crafted the Dickeyville Grotto and Shrines from stone and dedicated the building to the ...unity of two great American ideals-love of God and love of Country.'' This shrine is unique because it embraces both the Catholic faith and patriotism. Embedded in the stone and mortar are a variety of brightly colored glass, pottery, stalagmites and stalactites, seashells, starfish, gems, sea urchins, corals, quartz, ores, iron, copper, lead, fool's gold, onyx, amethyst, rock crystals, coal, wood, and moss. This creates a chaotic, yet unique piece of art that draws visitors from all over the Midwest. Featured on the grounds of the Grotto are several shrines including the shrine of the Holy Eucharist, the Sacred Heart shrine, a patriotic shrine, Christ the King shrine, the Stations of the Cross, and the Fatima shrine. The shrines are located throughout the garden surrounding the onsite Holy Ghost Church. The Grotto has pillars of rose quartz sent from South Dakota on either side of its entrance, one of which is crowned with the American flag and the other with the papal flag. The face of the Grotto has fifteen decade's worth of rosaries embedded in the stone. There is a statue made of Italian White Carrara Marble, which was sculpted in Europe. The walls of the interior of the Grotto feature the stones, corals, and shells for which the Grotto is famous. The Tree of Life on the grounds features the 12 fruits of the Holy Ghost.

That altar had duplicated the one in the Church of St. Paul in Rome. There are four pillars supporting the dome and were sculpted from New Mexican rock and banded with brightly colored glass. The Altar of the Holy Eucharist is a small shrine with grapes and wheat symbols honoring the Holy Eucharist. Finally, The Flower Pot is considered one of the most beautiful attractions at the site.

"Popular Summer Destination","Wisconsin","Popular Summer Destination","The Henry W. Maier Festival Park is quiet throughout the winter, but once the weather warms up, it is the most popular summer destination in Milwaukee. Every weekend there is a festival being held at the park, which is home to the world's largest music festival, Milwaukee's Summerfest. As a matter of fact, the park is often referred to by locals as the Summerfest grounds. The ampitheatre on the site is a popular concert venue during the spring, summer, and fall months, even when there are no events at the park. Frequently, the back entrace of the park is opened so visitors can reach the ampitheatre without trudging through the entire grounds. Summerfest is the reason the fairgrounds came into existence.In 1968 the music festival began, but was held in 35 different locations around the city. The following year the weather was so horrible the final day of the show had to be cancelled. By 1970, city officials had decided upon a permanent, central location for the festival. It would be held at an abandoned strip of land on the shores of Lake Michigan in downtown Milwaukee. Originally, this site featured makeshift stages of wooden boards on concrete in the middle of a field of grass. Undeterred by the lax performance facility, musicians loved being a part of the annual festival because of the comraderie and passion for music it promotes. Today, the festival grounds features over five stages, plus the ampitheatre, and most of the performances cost no more than the price of general admission to the park. Throughout the grounds are stands with food and beverages from local favorites such as Saz's restaurant, Miller-Coors Brewing, Cousin's Subs, and Edwardo's Natural Pizza. The festival is suitable for children during the daylight hours and offers a variety of performances and activities for them. The near-nightly magic show featuring local magician David Seebach is highly recommended. While some of the youth-oriented events continue into the evening, Summerfest is not the ideal location for children after sundown. There is a lot of alcohol consumed, and the behavior of the patrons is reflective of that. The organizers of the event have gone to great lengths to ensure guests are safe and comfortable while at the park. Typically, the only concern concert goers have is the rowdy crowds in attendance at certain shows. Overall, it is a fun experience. In addition to Summerfest, the park plays host to a wide variety of ethnic and cultural festivals throughout the season. Most popular are Festa Italiana, German Fest, and Polish Fest. Other events includes African World Festival, Arab World Fest, Asian Moon Festival, Indian Summer, Mexican Fiesta, and Pride Fest.

Alma is a quintessential MidWest town. Its development began in 1848 when two Swiss men arrived to cut the wood they would later use to fuel the steamboats traveling up and down the Mississippi River. After building their small shack, they settled there permanently, and others soon followed suit. Most of the early inhabitants were Swiss immigrant, and some believe they chose the area because it reminded them of Switzerland. These early settlers built the first streets in downtown Alma, Main Street, which is also known as First Street, and Second Street, sometimes called Upper Street. A number of small connecting street surround them, many of which do not permit vehicles. When the river froze during the winter, the settlers had to find another industry to support their lives, so they build a brewery in the center of town. There were also nearby cigar factories. Fishing and hunting have always played a major role in the economy of the area, and there is a fishing float located near the dam, as well as a fishing dock.

"Spiritual Tradition in Milwaukee","Wisconsin","Spiritual Tradition in Milwaukee","The St. Joan of Arc Chapel has traveled throughout the entire world over its life. It not sits on the campus of Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1966 it was dedicated to Joan of Arc following its transfport from Long Island to Milwaukee. The chapel began its life in the Rhone River Valley in France. The chapel's original name was St. Martin de Sayssuel, and is estimated to have been built around the 15th century. The building was left in ruins following the French Revolution, but after World War I the chapel was rediscovered and moved to Jericho, New York in 1927 by architect Jacques Couelle and Gertrude Hill Gavin. In 1964 the chapel was moved to Milwaukee. The process took more than nine months and a reconstruction occurred once it was on the grounds of the University. While the chapel was located in New York, the Joan of Arc stone was added to the church. The legend of the stone involved Joan of Arc praying to a statue of Jesus' mother Mary while standing on the stone. Following the prayer, she kissed the stone and since then, the air around the stone is said to be colder. The chapel is filled with a variety of Christian artifacts including many that predate the chapel itself. These include various crucifixes, and Spanish tapestries and coats of arms. These items and their environment are unique because they are a part of one of the few exhibits visitors are allowed to handle when touring the chapel. St. Joan of Arc is a popular destination for those visiting the campus of Marquette University, as well as those traveling through the city. The chapel is believed to be the only medieval structure in the entire western hemisphere dedicated to its original purpose. Tours are available for the chapel and last about 30 minutes. They are free of charge but visitors are encouraged to make a donation. Mass is held at the chapel weekdays during the school year. The chapel is closed on all major holidays and on days when the university is closed. Weddings and baptisms are not held at the church, much to the chagrin of many who discover the charming building and have a desire to hold their special event within its walls. The chapel features many of the traditional architectural details of a Catholic church and features beautiful stained glass windows. These windows were not a part of the original chapel. The chapel and Marquette University are located a few minutes west of the heart of downtown Milwaukee. There are a number of other attractions and dining establishments nearby. Those visiting the chapel and campus can spend their afternoon shopping at the Grand Avenue Shops, strolling through cathedral square, or visiting the Miller Brewery. Milwaukee's famous lakefront is a few blocks away from the Marquette campus and during the summer there will aways be something exciting going on over on that side of town. From music festivals to farmers markets, there is plenty to do around the city of Milwaukee. Visit Cream City and tour the St. Joan of Arc Chapel at Marquette."

The show began as a traveling experience that was based in Chicago. The second performances occurred at the Dells, and it was such a popular event, city officials asked Bartlett to make the Dells his permanent home. The show continued to travel on the occasional basis performing at World's Fairs and U.S.O tours. In 2008, terrential downpour storms and flooding caused Lake Delton to flood and subsequently drain. The flooding was so bad, there were houses washed away into the Wisconsin River. The show was forced to be scaled back, and for the obvious reasons, did not include the water performances. Fewer people attended the show, but there were still die-hard supporters that wanted to make sure the show would be able to rebuild for future years. In 2009, the show was back, better than ever. The lake had been refilled, and it once again provided the backdrop for amazing stunts and tricks. People were relived to find out the show would go on.

Brady Street was the scene of one of Milwaukee's most famous events. During the late 1800's, the St. Hedwig's church, a parish primarily made up of Polish immigrants, rapidly grew in the area. Because of this rapid growth, the church experienced descension in the ranks, and the parish split. One group had a desire to adhere to their Polish traditions. The other group was more progressive and had a desire to assimilate into their new culture in order to enjoy the American experience. In 1885, the issue reached its zenith. The pastor of the church hired an organist who spoke no English. This infuriated the progressives in the church because they had a desire for their children to learn English. On September 22nd, a riot ensued, resulting in a variety of arrests and several injuries. There was also a lot of damage done to the church. As punishment, the Archbiship shut the church down. During the revolutionary days of the 1960's, Brady Street was known as Milwaukee's Haight-Ashbury, nicknamed for the progressive area in San Francisco. The flower children of the midwest flocked to the area and were the catalyst for a variety of artistic endeavors, political movements, and celebrations of alternative lifestyles. It was during this time the famous Brady Street Days began, a festival that still occurs annually but has become somewhat more mainstream. The community feeling that has been a part of Brady Street since it first formed is alive and well today. The shopping distric brings people from all over Milwaukee who are in search of unique gifts. The bells of St. Hedwig's still chime every hour, reminding visitors and residents of the heritage of this nine block expanse just north of downtown Miwaukee. Many residents feel there is no reason to ever leave the confines of their neighborhood. There are shops, services, restaurants, and boutiques all within walking distances. The cuisine of Brady Street is one of its most popular features. People from all over the city head to this area for ethinic cuisine including Greek, Middle Eastern, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, and French. Brady Street offers residents a neighborhood association that creates a true sense of community and responsibility. Membership includes a monthly newsletter that includes information about the history and future of Brady Street.

Picnic areas feature tables and cookout space, and there is a historical pavilion that is frequently reserved for events like family gatherings and weddings. Another popular spot for weddings is the bandshell in the center of the park. Throughout the season, there are occasionally music performances featured at the historic bandshell. Also on the grounds of the park is the Sunny Valley Schoolhouse, the Irvine Park Museum, and the Glen Loch Dam. Hiking is a favorite pastime of those who visit the park and many of them enjoy cross country skiing on the trails during the winter. The zoo is one of the main attractions at the park. Featured there are elk, buffalo, deer, and monkeys. Changes are being made at the park and the zoo is growing. New exhibits include a complex designed for cougar, bobcats, and black bear. The new bear enclosure is 5,000 square feet and ensures the bear and those who visit them are kept safe. Much of the funds needed to build this were donated, as well as materials and labor. The animals were originally sequestered in out of date structures that meant being kept behind bars. With the updates, these large animals can roam freely in a more natural environment, which is healthier for the animal and safer for those visiting. The opinion of zoo goers and those who frequent the park has been improved since the facility was upgraded. A complaint of a lot of zoo goers, especially at the larger establishments, is the fact is can get crowded and make it tough to see the animals. This zoo is rarely crowded. It may not feature the rare species of some of the larger zoos, but if you are looking for a place to take your kids and expose them to nature and wildlife, this may be the solution. The town of Chippewa Falls features a variety of Midwest adventures that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

There is a variety of shopping, dining, and recreational activities throughout the town, as well as accommodations for those who would like to spend a night or two.
