"Alpine Lakes Loop Trail","Nevada","Alpine Lakes Loop Trail - Great Basin National Park, Nevada - An Easy Hike with Spectacular Views","The Great Basin National Park, which covers most of Nevada's South Snake Range on a line midway between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, is so remote that its night skies are among the darkest in the country. It boasts one of only a handful of bristlecone pines - which, sometimes reaching an age of 5,000 years, are the oldest trees on earth. The park is also full of ponderosa pines and pinyon-junipers and Douglas firs. It's full of mining history, with an 18-mile-long channel built by gold miners in the 1880's, and the historic mining structures of the Johnson Lake mine area. And it has the southernmost permanent glacier in the country. For a beginning hiker - for anyone who wants a gorgeous stroll at 11,000 feet - there's no more exquisite walk than along Great Basin's 2.7 mile Alpine Lakes Loop Trail. This trail's climbing elevations are mild. Its views are spectacular. Its flora and fauna will take your breath away:  Engelmann spruce and limber pines; butterflies; wildflowers spreading as far as the eye can see - from Parry's primrose, penstemon, and phlox, to Jeffrey's shooting star, crimson columbine, and mountain bluebells. In autumn you might see Townsend's, hermit, or orange-crowned warblers. Beginning at the park's Bristlecone Parking Area, near the Wheeler Peak Campground, you'll cross a footbridge, take the Alpine Loop counter-clockwise, and cross a creek. The trail passes two splendid alpine lakes, or tarns, that freeze solid in winter. The first of these, Stella Lake, has gorgeous views of Wheeler Peak - at 13,161 feet, the highest mountain in New Mexico - and Jeff Davis Peak. It also has a grove of aspens growing on its western bank, where you might look for dendroglyphs - the art carved into the region's aspens by nineteenth-century Basque sheepherders. After leaving Stella, the Alpine Lakes rail slopes down to Teresa Lake, which is filled by a spring-fed stream that is banked by emerald green grass. Shortly after Teresa Lake the path forks - on the left-hand, to complete the Loop Trail, on the right-hand to a spur that will take you up another mile, and 600 feet, to a half-mile loop where you can see the magnificent ancient bristlecones and the Wheeler Peak Glacier. Though the added 3.2 mile round trip to see these natural wonders will more than double the distance of the Alpine Lakes Loop Trail, it would be well worth the effort for those who can handle it."
"American Racing Academy","Nevada","American Racing Academy - Las Vegas, Nevada - High Performance Driving Lessons","The American Racing Academy can trace its roots back to 1996. That's when renowned Irish racecar driver Derek Daly partnered with BMW North America and began teaching high-speed driving at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

Among Daly's clients were Pete Sampras, Aerosmith, John Oates, and Vin Diesel.

"Aquarius Casino Resort","Nevada","Aquarius Casino Resort - Laughlin, NV - A Nice Casino Hotel Reasonably Priced","Among the things you can say about the Aquarius Casino Resort in Laughlin, NV, is that if you're lucky you can get a decent room in a nice casino hotel very cheaply - as low as $29.99 for two adults and two queen beds. The Aquarius, which overlooks the scenic Colorado River 100 miles south of Las Vegas in the Mojave Desert, was not always quite so good a deal. After opening in 2000 with 1,900 guestrooms located in two 18-story towers, and passing through the hands of several corporate owners, the hotel became so run-down that one guest complained of dirty carpeting/furniture, peeling wallpaper, and ill-fitting sheets.'' That all appears to have changed with the hotel's much ballyhooed $46 million renovation - $26 million on the casino and $20 million on the rooms. With 60,000 square feet of gaming tables for Blackjack, Craps, Mini-Baccarat and assorted poker games; a race and sports book with more than 90 screens; and 1,300 slot machines (from Wheel of Fortune Super Spin, Li'l Lucy and Fort Knox to All-Star Poker and Wizard of Oz) the resort ought to provide enough entertainment for the most discerning gambler. One might even get as lucky as Manuel Herrera did in 2002, when he won $8.4 million at the Aquarius playing quarter Wheel of Fortune. And if 60,000 square feet isn't enough to keep a visitor busy, the hotel can send you off on a river cruise where you can get a drink and learn something about Laughlin's storied history. Restaurants abound at the Aquarius. Its finest dining venue is Vineyard Ristorante, open from 5:00 P.M. Thursday-Monday, but closed Tuesday and Wednesday, which serves the cuisine of Northern Italy against a river backdrop. For the casual diner there are Windows on the River Buffet, and the Caf, Aquarius. Burger King, Outback Steakhouse, and Panda Express are also available, as well as four different bars, including the Splash Cabaret, which features live music, and a pool bar. For entertainment one can catch a show in a 300-seat showroom, a 1,200 seat ballroom, or a 3,000 seat amphitheater. The resort sits across the street from the Preferred Outlet Mall. It's not far away from three lakes - Mohave, Havasu, and Mead - and within a thirty-minute drive of five different golf courses. In Laughlin one might catch the Laughlin River Run - one of the biggest motorcycle rallies in America - a rodeo, or an off-road race. Though a guest might not know what to make of the Complimentary Starbucks Package,'' where one can drink two Grande coffees and eat two danishes at a cost of $34.99 a day - the hotel does offer such weekend packages for boaters as a launch pass, a two-night stay, one box lunch, and guaranteed boat parking, all for $184.14. All in all, one can agree with the German tourist who best summed up the Aquarius Casino and Resort: Sure, it's not the Bellagio ... but for the price we paid [it was] a great value....''"

"Beatty Museum and Historical Society","Nevada","Beatty Museum and Historical Society - Beatty, Nevada - Mining Museum on Death Valley's Doorstep","Located in Nye County, Nevada, just six miles from the California border, Beatty is the first community of any size one comes to when driving northwest from Las Vegas toward Reno. It has often been called the east gateway to Death Valley National Park. The Beatty Museum and Historical Society is a registered non-profit 501(c)3 corporation, dedicated preserving of the history of Beatty and its surrounding area. This is the heart of the Bullfrog Mining District and the site of the ruins of Rhyolite - true vestiges of the old Wild West. Beatty was established in 1904, and the relics gathered here paint an interesting picture of the town's growth and decline. Through historic photos and documents, one comes to appreciate what the founders of the museum realized as they sat over coffee some years back: without an effort to preserve the past, the legacy of a very important part of history would be lost. With the support of local residents and friends who became the first members of the Society, the museum opened in a small cottage in 1995. Generous donations of funds and artifacts helped the museum outgrow its first home, and for a while it was relocated inside the town's old water building across the street. Five years later another move was necessitated, and the museum was reestablished within an historical church, its current home. The building itself has been renovated and expanded to include space for a research room as well as the enlarged collection. The museum's exhibits, photographs, and collected antiques present an opportunity to understand what life was like at the turn of the 20th century. There are displays showing how early miners lived, worked and played, as well as information on the Bullfrog Gold Rush'' era of 1904-1907. Visitors can learn about ghost towns, too, along with the area's other attractions. Although no tours are provided, the museum has staff members who are available to answer any questions visitors might have. The Beatty Museum and Historical Society is supported through memberships, donations, or fund raisers. Currently, there are some 200 members in the United States and Europe on the museums list of patrons. Although donations are always welcome, appreciated, and tax deductible, there is no charge for admission. The hours of operation are 10am to 3pm daily, and the museum is closed on most holidays. Unless otherwise noted noted, photography with hand-held cameras intended for personal use is allowed, but tripods and lights are not. The address of the Beatty Museum and Historical Society is 417 Main Street, Beatty, Nevada 89003. From Las Vegas, take US Highway 95 North approximately 115 miles.

"Bellagio Fountains, Las Vegas","Nevada","Bellagio Fountains, Las Vegas","Las Vegas Nevada is a city that never sleeps. Day and night there are activities in Las Vegas for a tourist to enjoy. The best location to stay in Las Vegas is what is called the Strip.'' The Strip houses the top luxury hotels, most popular casinos, and most of the action. One hotel on the Strip is the Bellagio. This hotel is an amazing building, but it is outside the hotel, which interests visitors of Las Vegas as much as the casino. Outside the Bellagio are the Bellagio Fountains. The fountains are a choreographed water feature in which light and music is used to tell a story. The water fairly dances over the surface in a spectacular show. This is one show of Las Vegas that is free to attend. Tourists are able to fall in love with the display as opera, classical or Broadway interpretations are given. Show times are listed Monday through Friday as 3:00pm to 8pm at half an hour intervals. From 8pm to midnight the shows occur every fifteen minutes. It is possible to see the light and water show several times a day, so tourists can plan accordingly. On weekends and holidays the fountains run from 12pm to 8pm every half hour and from 8pm to midnight every fifteen minutes. The show schedules can vary. Shows cannot go on if there is a high wind factor. The Bellagio will cancel the show until the winds die down. A show can also be cancelled if there is a scheduled event that the fountains might interfere with. Before the show begins the water nozzles break the surface lining up for the first movement. The shows are changed out during the year to make the experience exciting for residents as well as frequent visitors of Las Vegas. Music pieces that have been used for the dancing fountains include: Con Te Partiro with Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman, My Heart Will Go On, The Ecstasy of Gold, All That Jazz, Fly Me to the Moon, Big Spender, Luck Be a Lady, Sabre Dance, and Singin' in the Rain. Viva Las Vegas, Your Song, This Kiss, and Santa Baby have also been a part of the show in the past. The music can change daily, as can the choreography, though typically they have a few shows they keep on hand and then change them out. The best time to visit the Bellagio Fountains is during the evening after the sun has gone down. The evening hours make it possible to see the lights better, so that you can get the full effect of the splendor they can offer. The Bellagio Fountains are set in a 9 acre manmade lake. The lake is serviced with a fresh water well drilled in earlier decades. There used to be a golf course on the land, which needed irrigation. The fountains use less water than the golf course did. There are 1,200 nozzles and 4,500 lights. It is said that it took $75 million to build the fountain."
"Big Dig Adventure, Las Vegas","Nevada","Big Dig Adventure, Las Vegas","Las Vegas is not just a city for gambling at some of the premier casinos. Las Vegas can offer you big fun in large machines. Children play in sandboxes with bull dozers, trucks, and diggers. There is something about playing the driver of one of these large machines that draws a child's attention. At Big Dig Adventure adults can return to these childhood days in a large way. It is possible to step away from the Strip for a few hours and drive a giant Caterpillar. At Big Dig adults can climb into the cab of a machine for thirty minutes and dig. Digging, pushing, moving, lifting, and crawling await tourists at Big Dig. Anyone who is 18 years of age or older is allowed to drive these machines. They also offer bachelor parties, family reunions, corporate team building, and incentive trips. Before getting on the equipment it is important to understand how it works and what toys'' they offer. The Caterpillar D5K Tractor has air conditioning in the cab, with plenty of leg room. This is a tractor which means the drive is completely inside with large metal tracks rather than tires. The D5K is a front loader which means the plow is on the front of the tractor so that it can push dirt or other objects. It is possible to adjust the air suspension seat for more comfort. The windows are large for any easy view of the blade corners and the cutting edge. These D5K's are good for fine grading, curbing, and creating foundations. Cat Hydraulic Excavator is another piece of large equipment. The Cat Excavator has tracks also which allows it to move over the dirt as well as climb up a few hills. The excavator can turn 360 degrees on its tracks to work. It has a long hydraulic arm, with a bucket on the end. This bucket will dig up dirt, carry dirt, and it can move large rocks. The arm partially blocks the side view, with a small air conditioned seat inside a glass structure. The Cat Skid Steer is a small tractor. Operation is done inside with air conditioning. The instrument panels and gauges are easy to read and there are audible warning signals when a situation is critical. The Steer has a bucket on the front for picking up large objects like rocks or trees. It works like a scoop. It is also a front loader in which you can only move forward to work, unless you lower the bucket and reverse to help smooth out the dirt. The fourth piece of equipment is what Big Dig refers to as the aggression session. This equipment is like the Excavator, but instead of a bucket there is a claw on the front of the hydraulic arm so that it can pick up cars. The aggression session is meant to bust through car windows, pick them up or even drop them for fun. The adventure begins at $150 and they are open 8-5 daily."

They open every day at 8am to Midnight seven days a week. They are closed for Thanksgiving and Christmas. A bit more on the history of the shop could be a bit of fanciful information. It is said a conquistador walking through the desert on his way to California was looking for water digging in the red dirt. He came upon some sort of object, but was unsure of what it was. So he scratched his name in it, re- buried it, and headed to California. Then years later Bonanza was resurfacing their parking lot and came across the artifact. They and the conquistador did not know what it is. The object can be seen at the gift shop. At Bonanza the World's Largest Gift Shop tourists can take home books, games, keychains, magnets, pillows, tee shirts, toys, and much more. The gift shop will have the less than typical books. They can offer some best sellers tourists might want for the plane ride home, but mostly they offer information about Vegas.

Gaming includes take home souvenirs you may want to use for your next poker or table game. Clay poker chips, mechanical card shuffler, poker dice, dealer's visor, real casino cards, and even the LV monopoly game can be found at Bonanza. Home and lounge categories offer even more. Tourists can bring home a snow globe, dice bracelet, dice clock, World's Largest Coin, Vegas Signage, or even a Las Vegas Spoon. Key chains and magnets give a small souvenir to take home. These inexpensive items can have Las Vegas signs, money, or other Las Vegas symbols. In their pillows section you can find dice pillows, Las Vegas signs, or chips as the designs. They are throw pillows with flare. The tee shirt and hats section is the most popular area of Bonanza. Shirts can be embroidered, painted, or screened for the design. Las Vegas will be on all the shirts. The shirts can be simple or complex with their designs. Some of the shirts have funny sayings about Vegas or the typical coined phrase What Stays in Vegas.''

"C Street","Nevada","C Street - Virginia City, Nevada - Where the Old West and Gold Mining in the Comstock Lode Come to Life","At the heart of historic Virginia City, NV - one of the greatest boom towns the world has ever known - lies its main drag, C Street, which itself qualifies as one of the world's most storied thoroughfares. By 1890, when the Comstock Lode had begun to play out, the miners of Virginia City had excavated $400 million worth of gold and silver - or more than $9 billion in present dollars, in a town of 30,000 people. And when the miners brought their silver and their gold dust out they brought it to C Street. On C Street fortunes were won and lost in an afternoon. On C Street men drank hard and gambled hard in any one of the 110 saloons that stretched to the horizon, and then they walked outside and shot each other. And the history of the place doesn't end with saloons. On C Street the citizens of Virginia City erected a grand opera house. On C Street, too, one of America's greatest writers, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, acquired his pen name. For a traveler interested in the Old West, it's hard to imagine a place more rich with history. Indeed, Virginia City itself - the whole town - has been established as the largest historic district in the country. And it all starts with C Street. You can drink a beer at the Delta Saloon just the way you would have drunk it when the Delta opened its doors in 1863. Across the street at the Bucket of Blood, after a shot of whiskey, you can go outside to watch a shootout. There are a lot of junk-filled tourist shops on C Street that didn't exist in Virginia City's heyday, including jewelry and t-shirt shops, rock and mineral shops, and stores that sell replicas of the hat Hoss Cartwright wore on Bonanza. You can eat as much fudge and ice cream as you want and dine at places like the Bonanza Caf, and the Caf, del Rio, the Palace Restaurant, and the Mandarin Garden. But there's a lot on C Street that's real. For one thing, you can stay at the historic Silver Queen Hotel and drink at its authentic 1870's saloon. For another, you can swing through the doors of the Ponderosa Saloon, pass its bar, and then, walking through a back room, enter the shaft of the Best & Belcher mine. One of the most fascinating things you can do on C Street is visit Piper's Corner Bar, in Piper's Opera House, where Samuel Clemens drank while he worked as a reporter at the Territorial Enterprise - a periodical that some people have called the most influential'' newspaper of the period outside The New York Times. Clemens used to call out to his friend John Piper, Barkeep, Mark Twain!'' - the Mississippi River boatman's shout meaning two fathoms deep'' to order another round for himself and a friend. Piper began to call him Mark Twain. After he used the name in his newspaper byline, it stuck.

"Cascata Golf Course","Nevada","Cascata Golf Course, Boulder City, Nevada ? a Rees Jones-Designed Golf Course That's Been Rated the #1 Facility in the Country","Cascata Golf Course is located about 35 miles from the Las Vegas strip, and features some unique topography. Flat terrain is pretty rare on this course, which has a number of elevated, mountainside tee boxes, canyons and fairways that are often winding. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2000, is a Rees Jones design that features some very interesting golf holes. The course plays to more than 7,000 yards from both of the back tees, with a USGA slope rating as high as 143. From the forward men's tees, the course plays to around 6,600, but the slope rating is still 138. There's a good deal of movement on this course, both up and down, and it's been said that because of the panoramic topography, including the 3,600-foot-tall Red Mountain, sometimes golfers have difficulty determining which way a hole plays if they're new to the course. Many shots require uphill shots to raised landing areas off the tee and on approach, and the desert winds can add another element of difficulty to the course on blustery days. The greens tend to have mild undulations at best and roll fast and true, but there are also some deceptive slopes that can be encountered. The course also features seven picturesque water holes, and some holes even feature mountain streams that feed into waterfalls. There are also 52 sand bunkers and a number of desert waste areas that function as hazards. There are many noteworthy holes from which to choose on this course, including the very first hole. This hole is a relatively short par-4 at 367 yards, but it plays uphill. It also requires an accurate tee shot between a large fairway bunker on the right and the creek on the left which tracks the entire hole. The green is also a challenge, with a false front that returns short shots and a putting surface that slopes from back-to-front. Hole No. 7 is a very short par-3 at only 157 yards from the tips, but also one of the most picturesque. The hole plays downhill and calls for a carry over some rugged terrain and a stream that cuts across the fairway then flows up along the left side of the green. The green sits in front of a canyon wall and a dramatic waterfall adds to the backdrop. The finishing hole at Cascata is a par-5 that plays up to 559 yards from the back tees and features a unique layout. The hole is shaped like a letter-S, and a stream runs its length, crossing the fairway like the other leg of the letter-X. There's also a large rock formation on the left that some golfers may want to shortcut off the tee to reach the second landing area. From there, approach shots take aim at an undulating green that adds to the challenging finish. Cascata has been recognized as one of the best courses in the country, including being ranked as the #1 Facility in the U.S. by Zagat Survey in 2009. Cascata partners with Rio Secco and Harrahs Resort/Casino for stay-and-play packages, but the course is also open to the public. And all players have the benefit of being accompanied by a tour-class caddie for their round. Practice facilities include a targeted grass range, which features a 418-foot man-made waterfall nearby, as well as a large putting green. PGA-certified instructors are also available. The course also features in impressive, 37,000-square-foot, Tuscan-style clubhouse with a golf shop, dining room, a cigar lounge with a custom-designed humidor, and a cascading stream that runs through the atrium."

"Cloud Nine Balloon","Nevada","Cloud Nine Balloon - Las Vegas, Nevada - World's Largest Helium Balloon","When it launched on October 5, 2009, the Cloud Nine Balloon was touted as the world's largest helium balloon.'' It was 75 feet tall and weighed two tons. When inflated with 210,000 cubic feet of helium, which took five hours, it could carry up to 30 persons to a height of 500 feet. From a tethered position across from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, passengers could get a unique 360-degree view of the Las Vegas Strip. Tickets were $17.50 for children and $22.50 for adults. Two years of negotiations brought the 11-story balloon to Las Vegas from Paris, France at a cost of $4 million. Because the Cloud Nine Balloon cannot go airborne in rain or winds above 22 miles per hour, and owing to its proximity to nearby McCarran Airport, Federal Aviation Administration permission was required. Then, in March 2010, high winds forced the ride to close twice. The first time a sudden wind gust hit the balloon while it was occupied, injuring one person and damaging the balloon. The second time, no one was aboard, but high winds caused the huge balloon to deflate, causing a second grounding of indefinite duration. Operator Cloud Nine Entertainment has announced plans to rebuild and replace the Cloud Nine Balloon ride with a bigger and better Las Vegas attraction.'' They partnered with Las Vegas Safaris to offer exotic animal encounters with baby rhinos, zebras, giraffes, and camels in the meantime. The address is 3951 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, directly across from the Mandalay Bay Resort."
"Colorado Belle","Nevada","Colorado Belle - Laughlin, Nevada - Casino Hotel With a Mississippi Riverboat Theme","As themes for casino resorts go, the Mississippi Riverboat doesn't qualify as anything original. Still, the Colorado Belle Casino Hotel, in Laughlin, NV, does a surprisingly good job of carrying it off. Though it sits among nine other casinos that line the Colorado River there, the Belle is built to look as if a real riverboat had grounded on Laughlin's shores. The floors of its casinos are known as decks.'' Its games are Captain's table games.'' Its entertainment is Dixieland jazz. Its restaurants have names like the Boiler Room. With its cheapest rooms starting at $15.99, Mark Twain could probably have afforded the Colorado Belle. Aside from the riverboat theme, everything at the Belle is pretty standard fare. Though its casino, at 65,000 square feet, is among the largest in Laughlin, the games are the same that you'll find anywhere else: reel and video slots; video poker; video keno; nickel games including Game Maker and Game King; craps, roulette, and blackjack; and poker of all varieties: Texas Hold `em, Omaha; and 7-card stud. As with the Belle's sister hotel, the Edgewater, the riverboat offers cash bonuses for Royal and straight flushes, four-of-a-kind, and pocket aces. The rooms at the Belle are un-themed, and furnished in the style of a Holiday Inn. The restaurants, though, are another matter. Besides the Boiler Room (a brew pub with pizza and burgers), one can dine at a barbecue restaurant called - what else? - Mark Twain's. If Italian food is to your liking, you can eat at Carmella's. And where would a self-respecting casino hotel be without its buffet? The Belle's Captain's Buffet has what it calls Exhibition Style'' cooking, as well as champagne brunches and dinners and a Friday night seafood special. And when, finally, you're ready for casual dining, you can eat affordably at the Paddlewheel. For entertainment, the Colorado Belle provides two Dixieland bands: in the afternoon, the Dixie Boys; at night, the Dixie River Band. For floorshows it sends its guests next door to the Edgewater, to hear various bands playing tributes to the likes of Jimmy Buffet, Tom Petty, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Seger. Then too, the Belle's history will offer a diversion for the curious, who might like to wander about the hotel's third floor to figure out in which room a former New Jersey prosecutor, fleeing a prison sentence for corruption and fraud, shot himself to death. Suicides aside, visitors to the Colorado Belle have offered less than ringing endorsements. Though many would go back for the nice casino,'' the kind staff,'' the good service,'' and the clean and comfortable'' rooms,'' just as many guests have complained of the rooms looking dirty,'' of the beds and mattresses being soiled,'' of poor restaurant service and frozen mashed potatoes, and of old-fashioned'' T.V.s. Still, as with the resort's sister hotel next door, the price is right at the Colorado Belle. At $15.99 a night, it would almost pay to move into the place."

For as long as this harsh, dry environs has been settled, the river has provided the region with fresh water for drinking, agriculture, ranching, and mining as well as a network of tributaries for transportation. The Riverside Resort was built on the Nevada side of the Colorado River by Don Laughlin in 1966. Within two decades, a town had grown up bearing his name, crowded with new high-rise casinos and hotels. Soon, Bullhead City sprung up on the Arizona shore. Today, the Colorado River is a great source of recreational opportunities for those visiting the Laughlin area. Outfitters can provide equipment for jet-skiing, rafting, kayaking, and canoeing. There are regularly scheduled water taxis and river tours, yachts for private outings, and even wedding cruises. Fishing trips can also be arranged to catch the river's Striped Bass, Largemouth Bass, Crappie, Trout, and Flathead Catfish.

"Comstock Lode","Nevada","Comstock Lode - Virginia City, Nevada - Historic Site of Silver and Gold Rush","Among the most important mining discoveries in American history was the Comstock Lode in 1859. Located on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson in Nevada's Washoe County, its mines would produce an estimated $700 million worth of silver and gold ore over the course of sixty years. The camp set up here to accommodate fortune hunters was called Virginia City. It grew into a boisterous 24/7 town of nearly 30,000 residents at its peak and briefly counted Mark Twain among its residents. So rich was the Comstock Lode that mines were excavated to depths of up to 3,200 feet beneath the town. The area became known as the Richest Place on Earth.'' By 1920, however, the Lode gave out and miners moved on, leaving just a few small businesses and 500 people behind by 1930.

Way outside of Las Vegas is a smaller city called Primm. Primm has a few hotel and casinos, just not the magnitude that Las Vegas offers. At Buffalo Bill's Hotel and Casino is the Desperado Roller Coaster. It is called a hypercoaster. A hypercoaster typically means the height is 200 to 299 feet, it lacks inverting elements, and it uses a lift hill rather than a launch. It can also mean that it has one of the above features. The reason Desperado is a hyper roller coaster is due to the 225 foot drop and 209 foot lift hill. The drop is at a 70 degree angle. The lift is a chain system. Desperado also has the distinction of being called one of the tallest roller coasters in the world. At top speed the roller coaster will go 80 miles per hour. It takes two minutes and 43 seconds to go around the track at close to 4G's. Part of the roller coaster track is set to go through the casino. Desperado opened in 1994. It was designed by Ron Toomer and manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. There are no inversions within the 5843 feet of length. When the roller coaster opened it was tied with the Steel Phantom in Kennywood for the longest dropping and steepest coaster. Its 80 miles per hour speed was 2 miles per hour slower than the Kennywood attraction. To ride the roller coaster guests must be 4 feet in height. The capacity for riders is 1700 per hour. The best seat on the roller coaster is the front to view everything around the casino. Red earth with sporadic trees and the mountains in the background make a nice backdrop to the roller coaster. When the roller coaster was built it cost $30,000,000. To ride the roller coaster guests do have to purchase tickets in the casino. They can pay for more than one ride if they wish. Primadonna Resorts runs the hotel and casino. Primadonna Resorts is based in Nevada with three hotels and casinos in the stay, with one bordering California- the Buffalo Bill's Casino and Resort. Primadonna is owned by a larger company, Herbst Gaming. The hotels and casinos are connected by Monorail and an amusement train. The transportation runs along I15. The Primm family was very important to the area, so the location of this casino and the others is in the Primm area, rather than Stateline, which was originally part of the region. Stateline still exists in Nevada, it is just smaller. The first hotel by the Primm's was Whiskey Pete's. Buffalo Bill's is the third hotel to be built. For a short time Primadonna Resorts belonged to MGM, but in 2006 they sold to Terrible Herbst Gaming. Now as part of the corporation there is Buffalo Bill's, Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas, Primadonna Hotel, Star of the Desert Arena, Whiskey Pete's, and several gas stations."
"Diamond Peak","Nevada","Diamond Peak - Incline Village, Nevada - Family Ski Resort with Great Snow and Small Crowds","All ski resorts can tout some feature that sets them apart from others, but Diamond Peak, in Incline Village, NV, has a longer list of boasts than most, and with good reason. Its spectacular views of Lake Tahoe, its deep snow and well-groomed trails, its steep mountain and family-friendly atmosphere all make Diamond Peak a favorite among the locals - who, as residents of the town that owns the resort, make all the decisions regarding its development. Founded in 1966 as the centerpiece of a planned vacation community, Diamond Peak has managed to keep current with the times and to run successfully while staying under the radar - and beyond the madding crowds - that highlights such larger neighbors as Squaw Valley. There's something at Diamond Peak for everyone. To start with, the panorama that its slopes afford of one of the country's most beautiful lakes, and the sawtooth ridges of the Sierra Nevada Mountains beyond, will take your breath away. It's got some of the deepest snow on the West Coast, at an average of 33 feet, and has consistently stayed ahead of the completion through its cutting-edge use of technology. For one thing, Diamond Peak had the first snowmakers west of the Rockies. For another, its emphasis on a family-friendly image made it the first resort in the country to modernize its ski lifts with the so-called launch pad'' loading system - a system that uses a felt conveyor belt to take the fear out of getting up the slopes. Having dedicated a large ;part of its budget to two separate youth programs - its Child Ski Center and, for young snowboarders, its Learn to Ride Center - the resort's focus on children is among the greatest in the country. Diamond Peak has not neglected other skiers either. For intermediates it has a blue run named Crystal Ridge that goes on for 2.5 miles. Even more astonishingly, because of the resort's reputation as a family destination, there's virtually nobody on the black diamond upper runs that have names like Lightening, Thunder, and Solitude Canyon. Indeed, because there are hardly any lift lines at Diamond Peak even on the weekends, no skier of any skill will run into crowded slopes. No matter how hard you search, you won't find a bad word about the place from anybody. Exclamations like Wow!'', and adjectives like Fabulous,'' and Wonderful,'' and (in Spanish, even) Espectacular,'' are the norm. No crowds, great snow, great views, great lifts, great runs, and tickets for less than $50? How can you go wrong with that?"
"Divine Nine","Nevada","Divine Nine - Las Vegas, Nevada - Challenging Nine-Hole Golf Course","The Divine Nine is a championship par-three, nine-hole golf course located at the Callaway Golf Center, consistently voted by VegasGolfer magazine staff and readers as the best practice facility in Las Vegas.

"Doge's Palace","Nevada","Doge's Palace - Las Vegas, Nevada - Replica of a Gothic-style Italian Landmark","The fazade of the Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino is a replica of the Palazzo Ducale di Venezia in Italy - the so-called Doge's Palace.'' For over a thousand years, the original was the residence of the Doge of Venice, an elder who was elected for life by the city-state's aristocracy as the chief magistrate and leader of the Republic. Reputedly designed by Filippo Calendario and built between 1309 and 1424, Doge's Palace is a fine example of the Gothic-style architecture that flourished in the late medieval period. It features broad arches and marble columns extending into the waters below, supporting a second colonnade beneath a vaulted upper level that features a tiled exterior and numerous decorative gables on top. At the Las Vegas property, great attention to detail was paid so that the copy is as exact as can be. The difference, of course, is that this Doge's Palace contains a 120,000-square-foot casino. However, its interior does reflect the lavishness of the true palace, complete with marble floors, colorfully hand-painted frescoes, and plush furnishings. The Doge's Palace is located at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, 3355 Las Vegas Blvd. South Las Vegas, Nevada 89109. A canal with gondolas and singing gondoliers is positioned in front of it, and the second level can be accessed from the street via a moving walkway."
"Don Laughlin's Riverside Resort","Nevada","Don Laughlin's Riverside Resort - Laughlin, Nevada - A Casino Hotel with Bowling, Antique Cars, and Even One of Steve McQueen's Motorcycles","For as little as $42 a night, anyone with an instinct for gambling can satisfy his itch in comfort, if not quite in style, at Don Laughlin's Resort and Casino in Laughlin, NV. Like most other gambling resorts in Nevada, Laughlin's Riverside features acres of casino floor - well, at 80,000 square feet, nearly two acres - with the usual poker games, slot machines like Wheel of Fortune, and a huge sports book room. It's got restaurants galore, including its Gourmet Room & Lounge where a guest can get a French gourmet dining experience'' from a classic renaissance menu'' - all moderately priced. In Laughlin's Prime Rib Room the meat is carved tableside. In his Riverview Restaurant a man can eat Giant'' hamburgers and Giant'' ham, steak, and eggs. At his recently remodeled buffet, the hungry gambler can line up at action cooking stations'' and dig into a multinational menu ... with choices from around the world.'' A Mexican restaurant with a 10-page menu does business in Don Laughlin's self-erected monument to himself, as does a Chinese restaurant called the Rice Garden. For cocktails you can check out the oddly named Loser's Lounge, or sing Karaoke in The Dance Club. Even boat tours of the Colorado River are not unusual in Southern Nevada. But the resort's owner, Don Laughlin, a Minnesota boy who got kicked out of the eighth grade for running slot machines and other gambling services, and who wound up starting a town and naming it after himself, doesn't stop with mere gambling and restaurants. He's got a 34-lane bowling alley complete with a full-service pro-shop and professional fitting and drilling. He's got a classic car collection with 80-something vintage vehicles, including one of Steve McQueen's favorite motorcycles. One room alone, billed as fully climatic,'' covers 30,000 square feet and has views of the Colorado River through what is called a glass curtain wall.'' He runs an arcade with the top 15 arcade games in the nation,'' including Ballistics, 18 Wheeler, Wave Runner 2, Imon Simulator, Fast and Furious 1, and Fast and Furious Drift and Club Car. Kids are accommodated by Laughlin at Don's Kid Kastle, with a play center offering recreation for children from 3 months to 12 years: a soft play area; a skilled play area; a movie theater area; a Nintendo game area; and a snack bar. Laughlin will even marry you, with deals ranging from The Chapel Package'' at $175 (with one bottle of Chateau Laughlin Champagne and two glasses), to The Occasion'' at $600, which comes with a banquet room for 50 guests, 5 bottles of the Chateau Laughlin, a three-tiered cake, Swedish meatballs, and much, much more. A minister costs extra. Indeed, despite some people's grousing about not getting the room they thought they'd reserved, or feeling that the food could use an update,'' most of the guests who return to Laughlin's town will book a few more nights at Laughlin's spacious resort."

"Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course","Nevada","Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course - Stateline, NV - Great Golf with a Great View","Set along the south shoreline of Lake Tahoe and backed by the mountains of the Sierra Nevada range, the scenic Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course has been a world-class golfing destination since 1968. It has been the venue for the Annual Century Celebrity Golf Championship for two decades and hosted both the U.S. Senior Open and the U.S. Public Links. Golf Digest has rated Edgewood Tahoe among America's Top Golf Courses.'' The course was designed by famed architect George Fazio with enhancements by designer Tom Fazio. It plays 7,555 yards from the back tees and 5,567 yards from the forward tees, offering a challenging round to players of all skill levels. With seafood as its specialty, the course's Edgewood Tahoe Restaurant is much sought-after for special events and weddings.

"Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course","Nevada","Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course, Stateline, Nevada - Described as One of the Most Scenic Golf Courses in the World","You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn't heard of Lake Tahoe, which was discovered in 1844 and whose name comes from the Washo Indian word for big water.'' At the turn of the century, the settlement became Friday's Station, a stage line for Wells Fargo and the Pony Express. Eventually, that gave way to the Edgewood Tahoe Resort, but it wasn't until golf was added in 1968 that the destination really took off. The Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course is set along the south shore of Lake Tahoe and has been described as one of the most scenic golf courses in the world. The original course was designed by George Fazio, the uncle of legendary course architect Tom Fazio, and features a simple, yet elegant, layout. The elder Fazio incorporated the area's natural wetlands, stately pine trees, brooks and the lake itself to craft his design, while the younger Fazio has been called upon over the years to renovate and tweak the layout. The course sits 6,000 feet above sea level, providing some spectacular Sierra Mountains scenery. In addition to the scenery, Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course can also play as one of the most challenging courses in the country. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays up to a staggering 7,445 yards from the Gold Pine Cone'' tees, with a USGA rating of 75.5 and a slope rating of 144. When the course played host to the 1985 U.S. Senior Open, only the winner, Miller Barber, managed to score under par for the tournament. For the average golfer, the course plays to a much more manageable 6,335 yards from the Silver Pine Cone'' tees, with a 70.2 rating and a slope rating of 131. Just about every hole on the course could be a signature hole, but some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 2, a picturesque par-4 that plays to 417 yards from the longest tees. Bodies of water sit right and left off the tee box, and the left hazard dwindles to a brook that follows the entire hole past a long, narrow green. Hole No. 6 is another favorite on the course. This par-4 plays to 442 yards from the back tees and bends to the right around a lake. Tee shots play to a narrowing fairway and approach shots take aim at a green well-guarded by a large bunker on the left and several pot bunkers at the rear and right. The home stretch on the course features three holes that have been said to take a golfer's breath away. Hole No. 16 is a par-5 that plays up to 564 yards as it bends down towards Lake Tahoe. Nearer the green, the landing area and putting surface are guarded by a distinctive, U-shaped series of bunkers. Hole No. 17 is perhaps the most famous on the course. This par-3 plays to 207 yards from the back tees, but only 147 from the forward men's tees. The hole plays directly along Lake Tahoe's shoreline and calls for a carry over a waste area to a wide green guarded by a huge bunker in front and two more behind. When the wind is blowing, this hole can be one of the more intimidating in the region. Over the years, Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course has received a good deal of acclaim. Not only have publications such as Golf Digest ranked the course among America's Top Golf Courses, but the venue has also been host to the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship since 1990. The resort also features a beautiful clubhouse built like an Alpine chateau, with two graduated levels to provide the best views of the area. Brook's Bar & Deck offers more casual dining fare, while the Edgewood Restaurant provides a more elegant atmosphere."

Completed in 1981, it stands in the plaza between Judy Bayley Theatre and Artemus W. Ham Concert Hall.

"Hoover Dam In Las Vegas, Nevada","Nevada","Hoover Dam In Las Vegas, Nevada","Hoover Dam, is located thirty miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The structure is named after American President Herbert Hoover, who was instrumental in its construction, first as Secretary of Commerce and later in his role as the President. In 1922, a commission was formed with a representative from each Basin state and one from the Federal government. This representative was Herbert Hoover, who was then the Secretary of Commerce under Harding. Hoover met with each of governors from California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Wyoming. He had hoped to come to some sort of agreement concerning the waters of the Colorado River. As a result of these meetings, the Hoover Compromise was born, it paved the way to what was called the Boulder Dam Project. The dam project was designed to provide irrigation, control flooding and hydro-electric power. Early plans called for the dam to be located in Boulder Canyon, so the name changed to the Boulder Dam Project. Concrete pouring in the damn began in June,1933. The heating and contracting of the concrete created a problem, to solve the situation, a series of interlocking columns were built. To further cool the concrete, cooling coils were added. After each layer had cooled, the cooling tubes were cut and pressure grout was applied. As the dam ages, the concrete continues to cure and strengthen. The facade of the dam consist of simple concrete adorned with Gothic-style balustrade, and a powerhouse which resembles nothing more than a warehouse. Many people have complained about the simplicity of the dam, as a result Gordon B. Kauffman, a Los Angeles architect was brought in to redesign the dams exterior. The results were that buildings were streamlined and an Art-Deco theme permeated the entire project. On September 17th, 1930, it was announced by Secretary of the Interior Ray L. Wilbur, that the dam would be officially named, Hoover Dam'', in honor of President Herbert Hoover. The Hoover Dam is located in the Black Canyon on the Colorado River, and sometimes it is referred to as Boulder Dam''. Hoover Dam, is currently the world's 35th largest hydroelectric station. The dam and power plant are operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, under the US Department of the Interior. In 1981, Hoover Dam became listed on the National Register of Historical Places and as a national landmark in 1985."

"Lake Mead National Recreation Area Offers Vacation Fun","Nevada","Lake Mead National Recreation Area Offers Vacation Fun","	Established in 1964, the Lake Mead National Recreation Area incorporates 1.5 million acres in Nevada and Arizona and is about twice the size of the state of Rhode Island. Home to Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the United States, this recreation area offers not only water-based recreation but also the opportunity to explore desert eco-systems and partake in a variety of land-based recreational pursuits as well. Lake Mead was created when the Hoover Dam was completed in 1935. The dam, which impounds the Colorado River, sits about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, Nevada and has always been considered a great feat of engineering. At the time of its completion, it was the largest concrete structure in the world and the world's largest electric power generator station. Most of the 8 to 10 million people who visit Lake Mead National Recreation Area each year choose to visit the dam as well. Guided discovery tours are offered several times each day year round with witty park rangers who encourage tourists to take as many dam'' pictures as they please. Aside from visiting the dam, Lake Mead National Recreation Area also offers a wealth of other things to do and places to see and the Alan Bible Visitor Center provides helpful maps and other information to help guests make the most of their stay. Most people travel to this area to enjoy the expansive Lake Mead, which extends for 110 miles behind the dam and is divided into several bodies of water. Boating is the most popular pursuit here and the lake is often crowded with boaters, particularly on the weekends in the summer. However, due to the pleasant climate, boating, water skiing, and other water activities are enjoyed year round. In addition, Lake Mohave, a 67-mile stretch of the Colorado River, is also considered part of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. It is also a popular location for watersports of various kinds, including boating, waterskiing, and more. Anglers can catch largemouth bass, striped bass, channel catfish, crappie, and bluegill in both Lakes Mead and Mohave as well as rainbow trout in Mohave. There are no designated swim beaches or lifeguards at either lake though many visitors enjoy freshwater diving here. Hidden coves can be explored via kayak or canoe and many outfitters rent the vessels and also offer guided tours of the Black Canyon or other scenic areas. Advanced reservations for tours are encouraged, especially during peak tourist season. This recreation area is also interesting to explore on foot. It includes three of the four desert ecosystems in America - Mojave, Great Basin, and Sonoran Deserts - making it a mecca for viewing various kinds of plants and wildlife, many peculiar to the area. Ranger-led hikes are available or trekkers may explore on their own. There aren't a lot of established hiking trails available here but those who wish to explore may acquire backcountry maps from the ranger stations or visitors center. Horses may be ridden in designated areas of the park and biking is available on the park's paved roads as well as on approved backcountry roads. Hunting is permitted during designated seasons. Campgrounds are abundant and offer many sites at each location. Also available at the campgrounds are restrooms, running water, dump stations, grills, picnic tables and shade.

"Las Vegas Hilton","Nevada","Las Vegas Hilton","Las Vegas can be split into two sections. There is the Las Vegas Strip and then off the strip. Most tourists try to book hotels that are located on the strip, even if they are not in the middle of the strip. Several of the hotels on the strip like Caesar's, the Venetian, Paris, New York- New York, and Mandalay Bay can be luxurious but expensive. Hilton is known for their luxurious hotels. However, the Las Vegas Hilton is not centrally located on the strip. Instead it is off the strip near the Las Vegas Convention Center. The monorail which runs through Las Vegas does stop at the Las Vegas Hilton. It is this transportation system that allows guests to get to the strip from the hotel. The Las Vegas Hilton is set up as a business hotel, with some entertainment and shows tourists would expect in a city like Vegas. Historically the land the Hilton is sitting on was once owned by the Ashworth family who moved to Texas in the 1970's. The hotel was designed and built by Martin Stern Jr. in 1969. Kirk Kerkorian also had a hand in the development. The hotel originally opened as the International. Barbra Streisand was the top performer back then with Peggy Lee in the hotel lounge. Elvis Presley performed 58 consecutive shows at the hotel. When he was playing at the hotel he stayed in the penthouse. Liberace was another top performer of the 70's who graced the hotel. The International was known for its World Heavyweight Championship between Leon Spinks and Muhammad Ali. Mike Tyson also defeated Tony Tucker at the hotel. In 1971 the hotel was renamed the Las Vegas Hilton. It changed ownership in 1970. Hilton split into two different companies; Hilton Gaming and Hilton Hotels. When this occurred Hilton Gaming joined Bally's, renaming the hotel to Park Place Entertainment. In 2004 Caesar's Entertainment, a part of Bally's, sold the hotel to Colony Capital where it was renamed The Las Vegas Hilton as part of Resorts International anchor property. Shows in the recent past have been Reba McEntire and Barry Manilow. The hotel itself offers stately rooms to their guests.

"Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel/Casino Continues to Grow","Nevada","Las Vegas MGM Grand Hotel/Casino Continues to Grow","The second largest hotel in the world, the MGM Grand Hotel/ Casino remains one of the most popular entertainment complexes on the busy Las Vegas Strip. The second hotel at this site bearing the MGM name (the first suffered a huge fire in 1980, killing 87 guests), this structure opened with much ado on February 23, 1993. Emerald green in color with a statue of Leo the MGM Lion sitting at the front entrance, the MGM Grand is massive, covering 6.6 acres. Dwarfed only by its neighbor, The Venetian Hotel, the Grand includes a 30-story main building with more than 5,000 rooms; The Signature at MGM Grand, which includes 3 towers with 576 rooms each; the award-winning Skylofts Penthouses - 51 in all; and the 29 villas of the Mansion at MGM Grand. When the hotel/casino first opened in 1993, its Hollywood theme was highly touted. Much of the decor centered upon one of MGM's most notable movies, The Wizard of Oz. Oz artifacts were displayed throughout the lobby and guests were greeted inside by audio-animatronic figures of the cast. The emerald green color of the structure was meant to echo Oz's Emerald City. Casinos, gift shops, and restaurants all had Oz-related names. However, by 1996, the Oz theme had worn out its welcome, and by 2000, the decor was changed to reflect that of old Hollywood. The hotel now bills itself as The City of Entertainment, hoping to appeal to mature clientele rather than families visiting the Las Vegas area. Also gone was the MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park, which was installed during a time when the city was involved in heavy marketing to visitors with children. The MGM Grand Hotel and Casino of the 21st century includes extensive state-of-the-art gaming facilities, still the main reason for a visit to the hotel. Thousands of slots and video poker machines are available in denominations ranging from 1 cent to $500. Table games, including various types of poker, dominate the casino floors and a 5,300-square-foot betting arena offers guests a chance to place money on their favorite horses or sports teams. Entertainment venues at the MGM Grand include the Garden Arena, a 17,000-seat complex that hosts sporting events, concerts, and more; the 740-seat Hollywood Theater, an intimate setting for top-name performers; and the Crazy Horse Paris Theater, which features scantily-clad dancers in a show designed for mature audiences. MGM Grand Hotel is also home to Cirque du Soleil's amazing multi-media KA production.

There are many different tracks at the speedway so that several types of racing are available. The track opened in 1996 and can handle 142,000 people. It is owned by a Charlotte, N.C. company, Speedway Motorsports, Inc. The track sits outside Las Vegas at 7000 Las Vegas Blvd. North, Las Vegas. Major races that are held at the track include: NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, Shelby 427, NASCAR Nationwide Series, Sam's Town 300, NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, Qwik Liner Las Vegas 350, NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series, SummitRacing.com NHRA Nationals and the Las Vegas NHRA Nationals. The Superspeedway is a D-Shaped oval with a 1.5 mile circuit. The Dirt Track is made of clay and is a 0.5 mile circuit. A Drag Strip has asphalt as does the Bullring Oval with a 0.5 mile circuit. The Drag Strip lets locals get a taste of what it would be like to drag race professionally because they allow them to race every other Friday night. It is aptly named Midnight Mayhem. The hope is that this outlet will keep them off the local streets. It is also used as a training facility for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. Some of the first races to be run at the new track were the part of the Indy Racing League. Drivers that have won at the track are Matt Kenseth, Jeff Burton and Mark Martin. Jeff Burton took home a million dollars from the Winston No Bull 5 in 2000 and Jeff Gordon won in 2002. 2006 saw the track undergo some reconstruction after the NEXTEL Cup in March of that year. There was work done on progressive banking''. This means that the degree of banking will increase the higher up on the track the car is. Because of this work there is more side by side racing now. These new configurations have allowed for more speed on the track. There is also a fan zone that goes by the nickname The Neon Garage''. Fans love this area because they can have access to the drivers, teams, and live music, and it is where the Winner's Circle is. The pit road is now closer to the grandstand area. Plus there is a quarter mile Legends oval at the tri-oval area. A new media center is the finishing touch. Several of the hotels in Las Vegas offer special package deals when the racers are in town.

"Las Vegas Natural History Museum, Las Vegas","Nevada","Las Vegas Natural History Museum, Las Vegas","When someone thinks of Las Vegas their mind normally goes to the Strip where the top casinos and hotels are located. There is more to do in Las Vegas than visit shows, casinos, and sit by a pool. Las Vegas has museums, wildlife habitats, wedding chapels, race car tracks, and more. One place visitors may find of interest is the Las Vegas Natural History Museum. The museum is a non profit organization providing education for the Las Vegas community and its visitors. Exhibits deal in the natural sciences with both past and present connotations. Interactive exhibits for children, classroom situations, and preservation are the museum's mission. The Las Vegas Natural History Museum's concept began in 1989. Citizens of the community wanted to find a home for the wildlife and prehistoric exhibits that were currently being stored in a building. It took until 1991 for the museum to open to the public. Since then they have several million dollars to enhance the building, its exhibits, and draw guests in. Exhibits are based on the desert and ocean land from Nevada to Africa. It takes visitors around the world. Exhibits begin with the most popular Prehistoric Gallery. There is a reproduction of a 35 foot Tyrannosaurus Rex. This dinosaur is animated, lifting its head and roaring at the crowd. A triceratops, ankylosaur, and raptor are also part of the exhibit. The ichthyosaur, a marine reptile has been recreated. This dinosaur was found in the Nevada desert. Nevada at one time was not a desert, but part of the ocean. An International Wildlife Gallery with mammals from several different places are on display. These animals are stuffed and mounted for visitors to view. One can learn what physical and behavioral traits bears, cats, dogs, deer, and antelope have. The African Gallery is a large display of Africa's Savanna with the Serengeti showing antelope, elephants, hippos, and other animals of the desert. The jungle is displayed with trees and brush, and thunderstorms rage bringing rain and lightning to the scene. Among this display is the Out of Africa'' exhibit. This display has three extinct primates of Africa: Australopithecus Afarensis, Homo Habilis, and Homo Erectus. From the Serengeti visitors can move into the Mojave Desert. Plants and animals native to the area are shown. There is also computer animation and interactive options in this section of the museum. The Las Vegas Natural History Museum has one live display section. This is the marine life gallery. In a 3,000 gallon tank the museum houses sharks, stingrays, and tropical fish. They have numerous species of sharks. There are also tarantulas, scorpions, snakes, lizards, and a Burmese Python in this live animal exhibit. The MGM Mirage is a resort and casino in Las Vegas. They have shared some of their profits to create a young scientist center in the museum. This section allows for children to dig for fossils and act like a paleontologist or even a marine biologist. Visitors can feel how it is to be inside a submarine as well as use microscopes."

"Mount Charleston","Nevada","Mount Charleston, Las Vegas, NV","The heat of the summer in Las Vegas can be escaped by locals and visitors when they go to the Spring Mountains. These mountains run about fifty miles on the west side of Las Vegas. This is where the Great Basin Desert begins. The mountains are more tall narrow ridges than the mountains of neighboring states. These ridges are separated with wide and empty valleys. The temperatures here are lower because of the elevations of the mountains. They also get more rainfall. Mount Charleston is the highest peak in the Spring Mountain range. It reaches an elevation of 11,918 feet. It is only a thirty minute drive from the downtown area of Las Vegas. The activities that visitors can do at Mount Charleston include hiking, picnics, photography and skiing in the winter. Many people just come to get out of the extreme heat. There are several ways to get to Mount Charleston. NV 156 and NV 157 take people into the foothills of the mountain. They can then pick up NV 158 across the eastern slope of the mountain. This gives tourists a fifty four mile loop to travel. There are also two shorter spur roads that will go up to Mount Charleston Village and Lee Canyon. The latter is where the winter ski resort is located. NV 157 is used more than the other roads because it is the one that is closer to Las Vegas. Visitors go through developments and a few residences then come to a vast amount of empty land. Traveling this road, visitors can see Joshua Trees which are more often seen in the nearby Mojave Desert. As the road goes up in elevation these trees disappear to be replaced by pine trees. This road will cross into the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. Because of the large canyons on Mount Charleston that drain the water from the peak people driving along the road can see many cascading waterfalls. The area is serene and unspoiled wilderness. Views, trails and picnic areas can be found in a nine mile stretch of NV 158 which connects the two entry points of Mount Charleston. Desert Viewpoint is a short hike and on a clear day peaks in the Sheep and Las Vegas ranges can be viewed. Hilltop campsite has a great view to the east of the desert. There are six camps in the area. There is a cave that is south of the road that takes people to Robbers Roost Cave, which is really a large opening in the limestone cliffs. At Mount Charleston Village there is an 8.3 mile hiking trail that is rather steep to the summit. A seasonal waterfall is Mary Jane Falls.

It is located within the Sahara Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The NASCAR Cafy is famous the world over for its unique, one-of-a-kind interactive atmosphere and is divided into four sub-sections, each with its own unique experience to offer visitors. The first section is the NASCAR Cafy itself, located in the main dining room on the second floor. It was built around an exciting stock car racing theme and can be said to double as a NASCAR museum of sorts as well. Approximately 20 genuine NASCAR stock cars are on display for the enjoyment and pleasure of the diners, as are many other pieces of authentic racing memorabilia. Giant television screens are positioned around the room so that fans can enjoy the NASCAR experience while they eat and enjoy cocktails. The fare offered on the menu could best be described as American cuisine and includes items like burgers, ribs, chicken, pizza, and pasta. Drink specials are available at the Carzilla Bar. Weighing in at a whopping 3 tons, the Carzilla is the world's largest Pontiac Grand Prix stock car and was personally designed by the great Dale Earnhardt. For NASCAR fans seeking a more pub-like experience, there is also the NASCAR bar on the first floor. The second section of the NASCAR Cafy is the Cyber Speedway, a 35,000 square foot arena filled with some of the very best racing simulators to be found anywhere. These simulators consist of detailed and realistic stock cars available with your choice of automatic or stick shift transmissions. Each also comes equipped with 10 different adjustable options to provide the most realistic possible racing experience. These include tire pressure, horsepower, and braking response to name just a few. State-of-the-art visuals and top notch sound round things out for the perfect virtual reality experience. The third section is where visitors will find Speed: The Ride, a top-of-the-line, ultra-exhilarating roller coaster that is sure to get anyone's pulse pounding.

Photo souvenirs of the riders' experiences are available as well for those who want them. For video game lovers, there is the fourth and final section of the NASCAR Cafy, the Pit Pass Arcade. Located on the first floor, this is a high quality, high tech arcade that features over 120 different player stations. The latest arcade games are all represented, as are tried and true classics for the nostalgic gamer. Redemption games are also part of the mix.

"National Automobile Museum","Nevada","National Automobile Museum, Reno, NV","Reno, Nevada is home to many casinos although it isn't on the same scale as Las Vegas. Where Las Vegas is known as the City that never sleeps'', Reno is called the Biggest little city in the World''. This has a lot to do with the casinos, but Reno has other attributes. The weather isn't quite as hot because it is closer to the Sierras. Reno is in close proximity to Lake Tahoe where all kinds of recreation is available. Besides the casinos and natural beauty there are several attractions for families, vacationers and business travelers. The National Automobile Museum of Reno is a great place to walk through history. Cars have changed since they were first invented and at the Museum visitors can watch this change. They have decorated the museum with streets that reflect the time period of the vehicles. Some of the cars were owned by famous people. A Thomas Flyer, the first American made car to win the New York to Paris race in 1908 is on display. It was a 4 cylinder car with 60 H.P. and cost forty five hundred dollars. There is a Stutz Bearcat that was part of the Indianapolis 500 in the early days of the race. Visitors can see the 1961 Roth's Beatnik Bandit'', a sleek low slung topless two seater. The engine is exposed and the paint is customized. A 1912 Baker Electric V Special Extension Coupe owned by actor Andy Griffith resides at the museum and so does a 1914 Bugatti Type 40A Cabriolet. The familiar Jaguar hood ornament is there on a 1949 XK-120 Roadster. A 1910 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Tourer and 1927 Rolls Royce Phantom Cabriolet Deville are among the most desirable of cars. Little known car manufacturers have their classic and unique cars at the museum. Celebrities like Al Jolson, Frank Sinatra and James Dean's personal autos are on display. Frank drove a 1961 Ghia L 6.4 Hardtop. Elvis Presley's 1973 Cadillac Eldorado Custom Coupe with its distinctive hood ornament makes it a very popular car at the museum. The bad boy of film James Dean drove a rather innocuous 1949 Mercury Series 9CM 6 passenger Coupe. The National Automobile Museum is dedicated to helping students learn more about the automobile and the different eras that produced the cars. With this in mind they have school programs that can assist teachers with teaching history, science, social studies, visual arts, math and many other subjects. All of the exhibits reflect the time period of the car. There are also programs for adults and families. There is a gift shop at the museum that is stocked with books for restoring vehicles, cookbooks and books that appeal to children. Clothing items for all ages are available.

"Nevada State Museum","Nevada","Nevada State Museum, Carson City, NV","Carson City, Nevada is the State Capitol although it is not one of the largest or centrally located capitols. The city was named after the famed Kit Carson who was a famous scout. John C. Fremont was one of the first Europeans to see this part of the country that was called Eagle Valley by the Washoe Indians. The gold and silver rushes of the Comstock Lode in 1859 helped Carson City become more populated. The Virginia and Truckee Railroad ran tracks from Virginia City to Carson City in the 1860's, making the city easier to reach. However, the Southern Pacific Railroad installed a line through Donner Pass which proved problematic to the city's population in later years. The Nevada State Museum relays the history of the area. It is located at 600 North Carson St. and is open Wednesday through Saturday. The hours of operation are from 8:32 am to 4:30 pm. The museum is closed for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. There is an elevator that allows visitors in wheelchairs access to the museum. Tours are available by request. Admission to the museum is Adults: six dollars, Seniors: four dollars, Children seventeen and under: free. Members of the museum are also free.

The medallions are minted on a special coin Press No. 1. The museum also hosts lectures and different shows throughout the year. A schedule of events is at the online site. There are several areas for the exhibits with the Marjorie Russell Center displaying clothing and textiles. The collection has approximately ten thousand artifacts. There is women's clothing that began in the eighteenth century and continues to present day. Children's clothing, hats and ceremonial dress is part of the exhibit as well. The textiles that are displayed include flags and banners. Military uniforms are part of the fashions that help to communicate the history, symbols and economic status of the wearers. This building is also part of an extensive research facility that tells about the technical data of the textiles and clothing. The staff can help provide answers about preserving heirlooms and give them names of textile experts that may be able to help. Student internships are available to students at the University of Nevada. Marjorie Russell was one of the First Ladies of Nevada and the collection houses some of her personal items. Visitors need to schedule an appointment to view the center. Visitors can see the Carson City Mint Building that made coins from 1870 to 1893. They continue on to the geological history area with rock specimens and photos. A Columbian Mammoth that was found in Black Rock Desert has been reconstructed and a Native American exhibit tells of their culture in their own words."
"Nevada State Railroad Museum","Nevada","Nevada State Railroad Museum, Carson City, NV","The railroad played an important part in the development of Carson City, Nevada and was also responsible for its decline. When the Virginian & Truckee Railroad track was built it really opened up Carson City, which is the state capitol. However, when the Southern Pacific Railroad put a line through Donner Pass it went farther north than Carson City so the visitors to the city slowed down considerably. In honor of the railroads roll in Carson City there is a Nevada State Railroad Museum. The museum is located at 2180 S. Carson St. and it is only open Fridays through Mondays. The hours of operation are from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm and it is closed on Christmas and New Year's Day.

The fare for the motorcar is Adults: four dollars, Seniors: three dollars, Friends of the Museum: two dollars, Children (6-11): two dollars and Children under five: free. The steam train keeps the same hours with a special Santa Train in mid December. Volunteers run the museum with some of them being paid to do so and others just for the joy of it. They become engineers of the steam train, are part of the steam train crew, and give tours. Volunteers also sell tickets or work at the museum store. For train enthusiasts there is a HO model railroad at the museum that has been built entirely by the volunteers. It is on permanent exhibit at the Nevada State Railroad Museum. The model railroad shows the progression of the railroad from the beginning days to the twentieth century. Besides showing the technology of the railroad industry it also shows the impact the railroad had on the state, economically speaking. The Friends of the Museum and many other volunteers operate the trains when the museum is open on the weekends. They are also present for any group tours that may be coming to the museum. If there are no volunteers to run the trains they have installed a push button so that visitors to the museum can run the train on demand. There is an opportunity for railroad enthusiasts of all ages to ride in the cab of the Steam train. Only two individuals may ride in the cab at one time and they must be at least six years old. Children must ride with an adult. The cost of the steam train cab ride is twenty five dollars.

"Nevada Way","Nevada","Nevada Way - Boulder City, Nevada - Main Thoroughfare in a Quiet Town","Located just 20 miles southeast of Las Vegas along U.S. Highway 93 en route to Hoover Dam, Boulder City grew up during the Great Depression. It was founded in 1932 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to house the workers who were building the dam. Ever since, Boulder City has endured as one of only two places in Nevada that prohibit gambling. For several decades, the consumption of alcohol was illegal, too. Without casinos, the town has retained a quaint, small-town atmosphere. In fact, its growth is controlled by municipal ordinance so that it remains a small community. The city didn't add its second traffic light until the spring of 1998. Nevertheless, Boulder City's primary attraction is its proximity to Hoover Dam and Lake Mead, making it a convenient lunch, breakfast, or shopping stop. Most of the town's businesses line Nevada Way, the name given to decommissioned State Road 500 that runs through the downtown. Although not well marked, this road is actually Business Loop U.S. 93 and runs parallel to the highway from the stoplight at Buchanan Boulevard to an exit point on the far east side of town. Where Nevada Way passes Wyoming and Arizona streets, it offers a number of antique stores, several restaurants, a hardware store, and a few art galleries. The Boulder City Chamber of Commerce is located here, as is the main office of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and the local newspaper."

"Rhyolite","Nevada","Rhyolite","At the height of the Nevada mining boom in 1908, Rhyolite was the third largest city in the state. It dominated the Bullfrog Mining District, attracting prospectors and fortune-seekers from far and wide. But when the gold ore ran out, so did the town's luck. Today it is an unpopulated ghost town.  Among the many structures still standing here in various states of disrepair are a schoolhouse, the Cook Bank building, The Las Vegas and Tonopah Rail Depot, the 10'x10' one-room Strozzi home, and the stone ruins of the Porter Brothers Mercantile Store. Of special interest is Tom Kelly's bottle house. It was constructed out of approximately 30,000 glass bottles. A much more modern attraction in Rhyolite is the Goldwell Open Art Museum. Developed by the late Belgian artist Albert Szukalski, it is a 15-acre outdoor sculpture park featuring seven colossal outdoor creations. Among these is a ghostly white interpretation of Leonardo Da Vinci's painting, The Last Supper. Some pieces are up to 25 feet high.

Room rates starting at $19.99, and the rooms themselves being nicely - if not luxuriously - appointed, give the Palms a character that's a step up from the middle-of-the-road Holiday-Inn-style range of most hotels in town. Its gaming room - what people have called the best casino in Laughlin'' - offers the usual range of slot machines and such games as craps, roulette, and blackjack, as well as the usual variety of poker games, from Texas Hold `Em to Seven Card Stud. The restaurants at the River Palms are also a cut above the average. Here you can dine in style at The Lodge, whose mountain retreat atmosphere'' will compliment your lobster tails (Twin lobster tail special, $19.99 with a River Palms Player's Card). There, at the River Palms Caf,, you can satisfy your hunger 24 hours a day with pizzas, Italian salads, bread sticks, and all-you-can-eat pasta. A third restaurant, the Island Buffet is a place that offers a spread from its seafood bar, as well as its Live Action Seafood Saut, Station!'', where, for $9.99 with a River Palms Player's Club card, you can enjoy its special Seafood and Prime Rib Buffet.'' There's even a Java Joes on the third floor, hard by Sammy's Comedy By The Shore.

At the Bermuda Club you can bet on the games by day and, by night, play video poker while catching a live rock-and-roll act. At the Lodge lounge you can drink 30-year-old Scotch. At the Shipwrecked Bar, under the glow of theatrical stagelighting, you can watch the Colorado River moving by. At the Parrot Bay Bar the bartenders are said to be as friendly as the poker machines. At the Pirate's Cove bar you can watch the action on the casino floor. As with all hotels, reviews of the River Palms are mixed. Some call its staff the friendliest.'' Some say Stay here and get robbed'' (one couple claims to have been literally robbed while they slept, and found the staff without sympathy or empathy''). Some found that it had a relaxing atmosphere and perfect service,'' or that it was best Casino Hotel in Laughlin, or very nice;'' while disappointed guests found the rooms dirty,'' the service poor,'' or they found broken locks, and dirty towels in the toilet. In the end, one suspects that as with most other hotels in Laughlin, the quality of a guest's visit will be a crap shoot."
"Riverfront","Nevada","Riverfront","The Colorado River is the reason Laughlin, Nevada exists. In the 1940s, it was a small settlement known as South Pointe that catered to the needs of local gold and silver miners and the many workers who were building Davis Dam. In 1964, Don Laughlin opened what would become the Riverside Resort, and today no fewer than seven additional hotels line the riverfront in the town that bears his name.  To connect the eight resorts and provide a scenic promenade for visitors, the Laughlin Riverwalk was constructed. It is somewhat similar to the River Walk in New Orleans. Although the Colorado River is just a bit narrower here than the Mississippi River is there, it winds past restaurants, shops and casinos much like its Louisiana counterpart. Also along the waterfront, watercraft rentals can be found, from kayaks to paddle boats. There are water taxis to ferry visitors between the resorts, and there are riverboat cruises that offer narrations on the history of the area as passengers tour the riverfront on open-air decks or in air-conditioned comfort. The riverfront at Laughlin is the scene of numerous celebrations throughout the year, too, the most famous of which is the annual River Run, the largest motorcycle event on the West Coast. Held each spring since 1982, it draws as many as 70,000 bikers for a five-day rally of food and festivities"

"Sam Boyd Stadium","Nevada","Sam Boyd Stadium","Built in 1971 to serve as the home field for the University of Nevada Las Vegas football program, Sam Boyd Stadium was renovated and expanded in 1999 to accommodate up to 36,800 fans. In recent years, it has played host to XFL, CFL, UFL, and NCAA bowl games, as well as numerous concerts, from U2, Paul McCartney, and the Eagles to the George Strait Festival and summertime appearances by the Grateful Dead. The stadium has carried the name of local gaming pioneer Sam Boyd since 1984, having previously been known as the Las Vegas Bowl and the Silver Bowl.  Sam Boyd Stadium still features its original horseshoe-shape configuration, open on one end, but the Astroturf it was fitted with in 1985 was replaced by a retractable artificial turf, TurfTech's so-called Magic Carpet, in 2003. This makes the facility multipurpose and available for events ranging from motocross to outdoor trade shows. Refreshment areas, bars, and concessions stands are located throughout the stadium, and food/beverages from outside are not permitted.

"Sand Harbor","Nevada","Sand Harbor, Incline Village, Nevada","Incline Village is the second largest community on Lake Tahoe. The city stretches from the shores of Lake Tahoe to the mountains from Crystal Bay, which is to the north east. The Town was named for the Great Incline Railway. The railway was built in 1874 to bring logs to Carson Range where a flume helped move the logs by water to Washoe Valley. In Incline Village there is the Lake Tahoe Nevada State Park entrance that takes visitors to Sand Harbor. Like its name suggests, Sand Harbor is a water land for outdoor recreation on Lake Tahoe. Sandy beaches will await the visitor, as well as mildly silted water. Despite the sand that can be stirred up while in the water, the lake is turquoise in color. To enter the park is $8 per vehicle, though for larger vehicles like campers the fee can be a little more. There is plenty of parking at Sand Harbor. It is possible to bring boats. An additional charge for boats also exists. At Sand Harbor a boat launch between the sandy beaches, rocky coves, and views is available. From the beaches visitors can stare out at the majestic mountains or walk along the rocky shores. Boating is not the only option at the lake. It is possible to go swimming during the summer months when the water has been warmed by the sun. Often times local residents will visit Sand Harbor for the watery fun, either swimming or boating. For a more adventurous individual scuba diving is allowed at the lake. Scuba diving in the lake is not going to be as wonderful as ocean diving. Crawfish and a few trout may be all divers see in the lake. There are no sunken boats to find. As an open water dive spot, it offers a good place to get certified or practice as a new open water diver. During the winter months ice diving is available. Winter sports at Sand Harbor also include cross country skiing. The lake does freeze enough at the edges to traipse across it,though one should be cautious and speak with a park ranger before attempting skiing on the lake. Other seasons of the year at Sand Harbor allow visitors to take treks around the lake, through the forests, and away from the beaches. Picnic tables are available for spending the entire day at Sand Harbor. Incline Village offers more than the state park for entertainment. It is a quiet corner of Lake Tahoe with a small commercial district. After spending the day at Sand Harbor tourists can take in the Thunderbird Lodge Historic Site or drive to Diamond Peak. The architecture at the lodge presents Old Tahoe'' with a slightly rustic log cabin appeal. There is a 600 foot tunnel at the lodge which leads to the private casino named Whittel's.'' It provides a nice evening after spending the day on the lake or in it. At Sand Harbor it is also possible to rent boats."

"Sevy Falls","Nevada","Sevy Falls","The Jarbidge River is located within a section of the Humbolt Toiyabe National Forest at the Idaho-Nevada border. Because this river has no reservoirs and is not easily accessible, it has become a premier destination for kayakers and rafters. There is a BLM campground and put-in area two miles downstream from the town of Murphy, just below the confluence of the river's east and west forks.  For the first 16 miles or so, the water is swift, gaining speed as the river narrows. In the area, look for juniper trees, red volcanic cliffs, hoodoos, and sheer canyon walls. However, there are no rapids greater than Class III until mile 16.5, the point known as Sevy Falls. Here, fallen trees, overhanging branches, and log jams are common as the torrent reaches Class IV proportions. In some years, it is possible to take a kayak through Sevy Falls for an exhilarating ride, but as of this writing, debris and a major rock sieve have obstructed the Jarbidge River about a half a mile below the rapids, so a portage is advisable for kayakers and mandatory for rafts of 12 feet or larger. A trail that extends for several miles can be found along the right bank."
"Shadow Creek Golf Course","Nevada","Shadow Creek Golf Course","Anyone with a fat checkbook and a guest room at one of the Las Vegas hotels of MGM Resorts International has an excellent possibility of meeting some big names stars on the fairways of Shadow Creek Golf Course. This is where George Clooney, Michael Jordan, Matt Damon, James Woods, Reggie Jackson, Joe Pesci, Michael Douglas, and other top celebrities come to relax and chase the white ball over some of the lushest manicured grass ever grown in the desert.  To say Shadow Creek is exclusive is an understatement. Access requires a room key at one of the local MGM properties, such as Aria, the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, the MGM Grand, etc. Green fees start at $500 per player. That includes not only 18 holes of golf, but also private limousine transfers from/to the hotel and a personal caddie. Newly opened in 2009, the Shadow Creek Golf course was designed by Tom Fazio to play par-72 at 7,560 yards from the longest tees. It features gushing creeks, waterfalls, lush gardens, tall pines, and immaculate greens, all surrounded by towering mountains. For those who prefer to use their own transportation, the course is located at 5400 Losee Road, North Las Vegas, NV 89031."
"Shadow Creek","Nevada","Shadow Creek, North Las Vegas, Nevada ? Called ``The Best Golf Course in the World'' by the Robb Report in 2000","Shadow Creek golf course has some unique distinctions in the golfing world. First of all, most world-renowned golf architects, such as the course's designer, Tom Fazio, are lured to a project with promises of an incredible piece of land on which to create a golf course. In the case of Shadow Creek, just the opposite was true. As Fazio explained it, he was told ...the land was flat and boring, one of the ugliest plots of ground I would ever see. It was a parcel of land that only tumbleweeds sought out.'' That fact makes the resulting Shadow Creek course even more remarkable, with its dramatic landscapes, lush gardens, sparkling streams and waterfalls, all beneath the backdrop of mountain peaks. The course also has a built-in sense of intimacy, unlike many western courses that boast of being wide-open.''  Each hole was carefully designed by Fazio to be framed'' so that golfers see only the hole they're playing and no adjacent fairways or greens. To accomplish that, more than 21,000 trees and plants were imported, which also separates the course from the stark desert terrain around it, making a round feel like a walk in a lush park. In true Las Vegas style, colorful Chinese pheasants, along with swans, geese and Australian Wallabies were also brought in to enhance the environment and the spectacle of the course, which made its debut in 1990. Las Vegas glitz aside, Shadow Creek is also considered a remarkable golf course for the golf. According to Fazio, the 10 par-4 holes on the course are all strong, distinctive and challenging. But it was decided that the par-3 and par-5 holes would be where the design would provide the most drama and evoke a wow factor'' from players. Prime examples include No. 8, a par-3 that plays to 145 yards and is the shortest on the course. This hole was said to be inspired by the secret hideaway in the movie Lost Horizon, where travelers could find everlasting youth. To reach this hole, golfers must pass through a tunnel, giving it the isolation factor of a private garden. From the tee, golfers play to a green surrounded by ivy and rosemary, along a pathway bordered by a bouquet of blooming plants. Another great example is the par-3 No. 17 hole. Here, golfers play what may be the most picturesque and dramatic hole on the course. From elevated tee boxes atop a ridge, tee shots play to an island green surrounded by rocks and water and the backdrop of a waterfall that feeds the lake in front of the green. Since its opening, Shadow Creek has been lavished with praise. The Robb Report called it The Best Golf Course in the World,'' ahead of such renowned finalists as Augusta National, Cypress Point, Pebble Beach, Pine Valley, and the Old Course at St. Andrews. Other golf magazines typically rank Shadow Creek in the Top 100, if not the Top 10. And, because of its location and its fame, the course can often boast of high-rollers and celebrities, such as Michael Jordan, Joe Pesci, George Clooney, Michael Douglas, and Matt Damon. Entry into Shadow Creek is limited to guests of the MGM Mirage properties, and a tee time includes a private limousine ride and a personal caddie to guide golfers through their experience at the course."

The concept paid off for the developers. Since its opening, Shark Reef has attracted over 8 million visitors and served over 100,000 Las Vegas schoolchildren. Shark Reef was accredited by the Association of Aquariums and Zoos in 2003, becoming the first animal care facility to be accredited in the state of Nevada. The aquarium remains the only accredited animal care facility in Nevada as of 2009. Shark Reef consists of 14 separate exhibits, some of them interconnected. The most popular and elaborate of the exhibits is the Shipwreck, a simulated pirate ship at the bottom of a 1.3 million gallon exhibit tank. Surrounded by over 30 sharks, visitors are completely immersed in the underwater world around them while hammerheads, tiger sharks, nurse sharks and several other species of shark swim around and above. In addition to the sharks, the waters around the pirate ship are populated by stingrays, barracuda and other schools of fish that visitors can watch. Visitors leave the Shipwreck via an acrylic tunnel that takes them directly through the shark infested waters and open out into a central court surrounded by aquaria holding one of the most complete collections of aquatic life in the region. The tanks include displays of tropical moon jellyfish, a Caribbean reef, a freshwater tank holding denizens from the Amazon, and a 2,000-gallon tank of piranhas. The Touch Pool lets visitors get up close and personal with horseshoe crabs and stingrays, which are safe for guests to touch - but the venomous fish exhibit featuring lionfish is most definitely hands-off. Among the exhibits at Shark Reef are a number of rare and endangered species, including Komodo dragons, sawfish, green sea turtles and Arapaima, a South American fish.

"Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat","Nevada","Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat","Siegfried and Roy are two of the most well known magicians. They are from Germany, but spent much of their life here in America. Their magic show encompassed two white Bengal tigers and several magic tricks and illusions. They spent several years at the Mirage with their show. On February 28, 2009 Siegfried and Roy performed for the last time. This was after a five year break, during which time Roy recovered from an injury. Siegfried and Roy began working on an ocean liner in 1959 where they met to come up with the act. In 1972 they brought the show to Vegas, and in 1990 their show hit the Mirage. They had over 5750 shows together. At the Mirage Seigfried and Roy created a garden and dolphin habitat to go with their tiger display. Tourists who visit the place can come face to face with a white lion, white tigers, panthers, leopards, and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. They just had a litter of tiger cubs born as well as a baby dolphin. Seigfried and Roy stated in a media interview that they realized they must help the planet. In working with such wonderful creatures they see how hunting has decreased the numbers of many of the planet's species. To help keep these animals from disappearing they have created the animal habitat to show everyone that these animals could disappear if action is not taken. They would rather allow the animals to run free in their natural habitat in peace, but for now that cannot happen. So the habitat is meant to educate, to help preserve animals, and help establish a breeding program. The secret garden and habitat is open daily from 10am to 7pm. Tickets are $15.00 for adults and $10 for children. The admission allows guests to walk through the gardens seeing the animals for as long as they wish. Admission does close 30 minutes prior to the closing of the gardens. For tourists who want to do more than walk through the habitat there are three options. Tourists can be a trainer for a few hours in the day. They can work with the dolphin trainers working with hand signals and the whistles to help teach the dolphins and learn how the show works. The second option is to have a VIP tour with a group. A group tour lasts for one hour. The guide takes the group around talking about the various ins and outs of the habitat, how they feed the animals, how much they feed them, and the care required for such a large facility. Lastly parents can set up children's birthday parties at the habitat. Children can have their picture taken with a dolphin, tour the entire facility, and there are other activities available. The programs have been designed for optimal awareness of the world's species. Siegfried and Roy's performance tigers are occasionally on display at the habitat, and at other times they are at the home of the pair."

After a training session of 30 to 45 minutes the outfit will take you up for a tandem jump - that is, hooked up with an experienced skydiver - at altitudes of 1 and 3 miles. It touts its state of the art'' equipment, with square chutes and an automatic reserve-parachute opener called Cypres that's operated by a mini-computer. Doubtless without exaggeration it talks up the thrill of free-falling at 120 miles an hour. It's got safety systems and backup safety systems and a 7,000 square foot air-conditioned office and hangar complex. It offers video and still footage of the jump from exit until landing,'' including recorded audio and the option of dubbing the videos with music, slow-motion, and computer graphics. Its staff, as it says, has over 100 hours of collective skydiving experience,'' with all instructors having more than 1,000 jumps under their belts. Indeed, Skydive Las Vegas says that aside from broken leg or two, it's never had a student fatality or major injury.''

The list of complaints goes on and on. According to some who claim that Skydive Las Vegas offered a full refund to those who didn't jump, the outfit did not make good on its promise. Many people have reported that an offer of a free t-shirt was not honored. People have claimed that the operation is not organized'' and that it overbooks.

"Stateline Fire Lookout","Nevada","Stateline Fire Lookout","Straddling the border between California and Nevada at the northern end of Lake Tahoe, the Stateline Fire Lookout was specifically created to provide some of the most panoramic views of the Tahoe Basin and its watershed, where fire is an ever-present danger. At an elevation of 7,017 feet, the tower is also a spectacular vantage point from which to look out over Crystal Bay and Brockway Beach. The only problem is finding the trail that leads to this scenic lookout.  Hikers who have made the trek advise against even looking for signs. The way to Stateline Fire Lookout is very poorly marked. Traveling by car from Crystal Bay, access begins by going up Reservoir Road between the Tahoe Biltmore Lodge and Casino and the old Tahoe Mariner casinos. Take a right at the firehouse and head up the hill to where a steep U.S. Forest Service road doubles back to the left. A quarter of a mile along this road and after a green metal gate is the parking lot where the trailhead is located. Sometimes the gate is closed, but it is possible to park and walk the distance. The hike to the top is relatively easy no more than 15 minutes along the fire road is all it takes to reach the historic Stateline Fire Lookout. In spring and summer, the area may be plagued by gnats and flies. In winter, it can be reached on snowshoes. Admission, of course, is free of charge."
"Stella Lake","Nevada","Stella Lake","Stella Lake is a crystal clear body of sub-alpine water located within the Great Basin National Park. It is to the east of and about 1,000 feet below the summit of Wheeler Peak. Core samples recovered from the bottom of Stella Lake span about 7,000 years, making this an excellent venue for research on glacial and climate activity, macro-invertebrates, fossils, and other geological, biological, and earth science studies.  In the late 19th century, gold deposits were discovered in the vicinity of Stella Lake. A head gate and rock dam were constructed by engineers from the Osceola Mining Camp to divert the lake's water through a series of wooden flumes and ditches for prospecting. Some remains of the mining activities can still be seen here today. During the winter, Stella Lake freezes over. As the ice begins to thaw in the spring, Bighorn sheep and other thirsty animals can often be spotted here, using the lake as a water hole. The surrounding landscape contains some limber pine and Engelmann spruce at the tree line, but otherwise vegetation in the area is rather space. Stella Lake is most easily reached on foot by hiking about 1.2 miles along the Summit Trail."

"Stratosphere Tower","Nevada","Stratosphere Tower - Las Vegas, Nevada - Landmark Tower Portion of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino","The Stratosphere Tower is the landmark tower portion of the world famous Stratosphere hotel and casino located in the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is the tallest free-standing structure in the entire state of Nevada. It is also currently the tallest free-standing tower in America, as well as the second-tallest in the entire Western Hemisphere. Available within the tower itself are two observation decks, a revolving fine dining establishment called Top of the World, and three thrill rides. The hotel portion of the Stratosphere is actually located in a separate building structure as opposed to within the tower itself. As Las Vegas begins to establish itself more and more as a fine dining destination, the Top of the World restaurant has become one of Stratosphere Tower's biggest draws. It is located more than 800 feet above the city and the restaurant itself slowly revolves at a rate of 360 degrees every 80 minutes to offer diners a breath-taking panoramic view of the city from above as they enjoy their meals. Top of the World is billed as a fine dining establishment and has been the recipient of much recognition over the years from respected publications such as Sante and Wine Spectator. It was even named Best Gourmet Room'' by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The other huge draw to Stratosphere Tower is the selection of state-of-the-art thrill rides available to visitors. Currently there are three to choose from with all of them taking advantage of Stratosphere Tower's considerable height to treat passengers to incredible views of the city from above while treating them to heart-pounding thrills at the same time. The first of these is known as Insanity the Ride. An experience on Insanity extends riders over the edge of the tower via a huge mechanical arm. The ride then spins the riders at speeds up to three G's, tilting this way and that all while suspended at a height of more than 900 feet above the ground. Insanity the Ride is insanely popular not only for the exhilarating experience it offers riders, but also for the unique way it offers them to view Las Vegas at its best. The next of the three thrill rides is X-Scream. X-Scream is described as a giant see-saw that operates while riders are suspended 866 feet above the ground. An experience on X-Scream begins with propulsion over the edge of Stratosphere Tower. After dangling for a while, riders are then pulled back up and then propelled over the edge again. Last but not least is the Big Shot. The Big Shot shoots up to 16 riders at time from the Stratosphere's 921-foot platform and up the tower's mast to heights reaching 1,081 feet before bringing them back down again. The sequence then repeats and continues at forces of up to 4 G's on the way up, as well as treats riders to an exhilarating negative G experience on the way down. Riders' legs dangle free throughout the ride as they are treated to a unique and thrilling view of Las Vegas from above. Admission to Stratosphere Tower must be purchased, as well as separate tickets to each of the individual thrill rides. However, Stratosphere does offer several package deals for those planning on experiencing several of the tower attractions during their stay. Reservations at Top of the World are required for dinner and strongly recommended for lunch."

"The Bellagio Hotel and Casino","Nevada","The Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas, Nevada; Jewel of the Desert","The Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada is one of the premier hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. There are close to four thousand guest rooms in the Bellagio, six clubs or bars, seventeen dining options, more than one hundred thousand square feet of gaming area, nearly unlimited shopping options, and more than 10,000 employees to meet your every need. This luxuriant hotel is separated from the Las Vegas strip by eight acres of water and the world famous fountain that shoots into the air at night accompanied by an amazing light show. The fountain cost an estimated fifty-million dollars. The Bellagio Hotel and Casino was built by Steve Wynn on the site of the demolished Dunes Casino. The Hotel was built in 1998 for one point six billion dollars. The opening extravaganza cost another eighty-eight million dollars and was reported to be the most expensive hotel opening in Vegas history. There are nightly entertainment options at the Bellagio. The longest running show at the hotel is the Cirque De Soleil performance of O. They play twice every evening except for Monday and Tuesday. The show is an amazing mixture of acrobatic high flying and underwater aerobics. The show is often sold out so hotel management recommends purchasing tickets in advance of your planned stay. The Bellagio Hotel and Casino is a major player in the economy of Vegas. The ten-thousand people that work there typically live in Las Vegas. The housing market in Las Vegas is in a downturn, as is much of the country, but expected to rebound as Vegas is such an attractive city to live. According to the Las Vegas Sun the median home price dropped below $250,000 dollars for the first time in nearly five years. For many Las Vegans this is not necessarily a bad thing as it indicates that local residents can again afford to buy homes in Vegas. Residents of Las Vegas work in tourism, municipal agencies, real estate, and finance related industries. Most residents of Las Vegas are migrants to the city which makes it a welcoming place for newcomers. Las Vegas is one of the few cities where people are very open to new residents. The job market in Las Vegas will always be stable, but this is mainly due to the multitude of service industry jobs that exist. In higher paying categories the competition will be much stiffer. The Bellagio Hotel is a great place to stay whether you are just on vacation or scouting Las Vegas for a possible move. The staff will ensure your stay is pleasant, but good luck on the gaming floor cannot be guaranteed."
"The Castle","Nevada","The Castle","When Robert N. Graves, the superintendent of the Empire Mine, decided to build a home in Virginia City in the early 1860s, he wanted it to reflect his love of French chateaus. He chose as his model an estate located in in Normandy and started construction in 1863. It took five years to complete The Castle, but even as the foundation was being laid, the massive project became a local tourist attraction, symbolic of the wealth that all of the prospectors and miners of the Comstock Lode sought.  The extravagant exterior of the Castle was matched by its elegant furnishings, from French lace curtains to silver doorknobs. In more recent years, it was furnished with period furniture and opened to the public for a while as a local museum, with numerous mining papers on display, such as records of gold and silver finds, production reports, and some of the area's 20,000 documented ore claims. Although entrance to the Castle is no longer allowed, visitors still come by to view its grand façade, and it remains an excellent example of the fine architecture that was possible in the Old West.

"The Chase Course at PGA Golf Club Coyote Springs","Nevada","The Chase Course at PGA Golf Club Coyote Springs, Coyote Springs, Nevada a Jack Nicklaus Course Said to Be One of His Finest Desert Creations","The Chase Course at the PGA Golf Club Coyote Springs is the first in a series of Jack Nicklaus-designed courses for the Coyote Springs planned residential community.  Both the course and the community are so isolated, it's been said that anyone making the 50-mile trek north from Las Vegas would be likely to encounter more coyotes than people along the way. The course is set amid an arid site ringed with mountains and has been described as a monument to shot-making.'' Water comes into play on more than half of the layout's 18 holes, and the bunkering and green complexes have been characterized as some of the most artful'' of Jack's career.'' Overall, the course has been called one of Nicklaus' finest desert creations.'' The par-72 course plays to a typically long 7,471 yards from the back tees and features firm, fast fairways with extreme undulations, giving the course a feeling of constant motion. Or, as its name implies, of constantly chasing'' the golfer during a round. According to Director of Golf, Mike Sizemore, Nicklaus wantedthe course to seamlessly meld into the surrounding scenery. The man-made rock features were created to emulate the mountain backdrops, and the resultmakes you feellike the mountains arejust a nine-iron away, not several miles in the distance as is really the case. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4, a par-4 that plays to 420 yards and features a signature view.'' While relatively short, the hole has been described as having plenty of teeth.'' Off the tee, players must traverse a large body of water to the fairway landing area, which doglegs right and features a large bunker at the curve. The finishing hole at The Chase is named All In,'' and is one of the most scenic holes on the course. This par-4 plays to only 375 yards from the Blue tees and features water that cuts in front of the tee boxes, then follows the hole on the right past the green. The carry to a wide landing area is not as daunting as it appears on the tee, but the approach shot to a long, narrow green located right beside the water can be. Some of the accolades accorded The Chase include being named the #2 Best New Golf course by Golf Digest in 2009, and #3 ranking by GOLF Magazine. Practice facilities at Coyote Springs are said to be among the largest and most diverse in the world. The facility measures in at 19 acres (with plans to expand it to 32 acres) and features more than 100,000 square feet of tee area, 13 target greens, as well as a short-game area for chipping, pitching and bunker practice. There's also a 10,000-square-foot putting green."

"The Edgewater","Nevada","The Edgewater - Laughlin, Nevada - A Decent Hotel Casino at a Reasonable Price","What to say about the Edgewater Casino Hotel in Laughlin, NV? Like the other nine hotels that line the Colorado River in Laughlin, it has good views. Its rooms are middle-of-the-road-Holiday-Inn types. It's got more or less the same steakhouse as each of its neighbors, this one called the Hickory Pit (with Yukon steak saut, and hickory smoked pork chops); more or less the same casual restaurant (Coco's, open 24/7); the same buffet (Grand Buffet, with weekend brunches free to guests with a member's card, featuring hand-carved beef, rotisserie chicken, and Italian, Mexican, and Asian food); the same pool (conveniently located near Dairy Queen and the Hotel Gift Shop''); the same beauty salon; and the same fitness center (open from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.).  In other words, with room rates as low as $15.99 a night, the Edgewater is a budget hotel. For the gambler watching his pocketbook it offers clean rooms and affordable fare including, besides the DQ, a McDonald's, a Sbarro, a Krispy Kreme, and an Orange Julius all on-premises. Like the other hotels along the Colorado, the Edgewater (owned by the same outfit that runs the nearby Colorado Belle) touts its proximity to Laughlin's riverwalk. Like the others, it's got water-taxi service to the larger Bullhead City across the river. It's got bars. It's got an arcade with, as it says, 30 of the most state of art games.'' At its Kokopelli's Showroom the Edgewater has live floor shows featuring acts you never heard of - including comedians like Richard Villa and Jason Collings, Chas Elstner and Laura Park, and Kivi Rogers and Johnny Watson. The Edgewater will steer you to jet ski rentals and boat rentals; to bass, catfish, striper, and trout fishing; to the many area golf courses; and to shootouts in the town of Oatman, some 20 miles away. What, then, sets the Edgewater apart? Well, for one thing the 26-story, 1,400-room hotel has a neon-blue waterfall painted down its front wall. For another, it's one of the most centrally located of the riverwalk hotels. It boasts the newest and most exciting slot machines on the river'' including the omnipresent Wheel of Fortune and Mega Bucks. Its casino is one of Laughlin' largest, featuring 3-card poker, Let it Ride, Pai Gow, and Roulette. Cash promotions include a $500 bonus for Royal Flush jackpots, $100 for straight flush jackpots, and daily specials that include so-called Quads of the Day,'' where four-of-a-kind can win a player another $100. Guests at the Edgewater have loved it: Great people, great casino;'' An excellent place in which to stay;'' and Relaxing if you want it to be.'' And they have hated it: Wish I could say something positive;'' and This isn't Vegas, baby;'' One visitor, though, probably best summed up the hotel when he wrote that the Edgewater is one of the best for your buck hotels in Laughlin.''"

"The Golden Nugget","Nevada","The Golden Nugget - Laughlin, Nevada - A Smaller Casino Hotel With a Tropical Theme","At $42 a night for a premium upgrade room, a gambler can hardly complain about a stay at the Golden Nugget Laughlin - which, if it is two steps down from its rival hotel, the Tropicana Express, is a step up from most of the ten other casino resorts that line the Colorado River in Laughlin, NV.  Though its standard rooms at $32 might compare with a Holiday Inn's, the $10 upgrade to premium sets the Golden Nugget apart. The resort's theme - every resort has to have one - is vaguely tropical. Besides a Joe's Crab Shack, the Nugget boasts a nightclub called Tarzan's. If its palm trees don't exactly evoke the Monkey Man of Africa, the palms nevertheless qualify the bar as tropical in a place that sits in the middle of the Mojave Desert. The Nugget is the smallest of Laughlin's ten casinos, only six stories high and with 300 rooms - compared to nearly 2,000 rooms at another of its neighbors, the Aquarius. Still, what more does one want from such a place than slot machines? The Nugget has those, as well as gambling tables and a Race and Sports Book. A gambling resort needs a steakhouse: the Golden Nugget offers up another tropically themed venue, the Saltgrass. For casual dining there's a restaurant called Harlow's. You can get a mound of pastrami at its deli. For coffee, you can turn to Starbucks. Entertainment? Of course there's entertainment. At Tarzan's it's possible to dance - to live bands or to tunes laid down by the club's djs. There aren't any of the world class acts that you'll find at larger resorts, but there is a state-of-the-art sports bar. You can catch a water-taxi to Bullhead City across the river. The pool overlooking the Colorado River offers nicely appointed cabanas that will make you feel like a sheik in a tent in the desert. Its lawns are well manicured; its gardens are lush. It offers golf packages that will let you play at one of three area courses. Visitors to the Golden Nugget have given the mixed reviews that are typical of stays at most hotels - from Great value'' to Hmmmmmmmmmm;'' from All the rooms need NEW air conditioners'' and Watch your credit cards'' (one guest reported that after swiping his card at the Nugget's deli, it was charged $2,000 for a cash advance at the Bellagio in Vegas) to Nice stay;'' and from Comfortable bed and pillows BUT..........''

Monday is Hat Night, when drinks are $3.50 for those whose heads are suitably attired. Other attractions here are a pool table, beer pong, karaoke, dancing, and plenty of free parking. Parties are held on occasion, and Lipstick provides the added benefit of being the only lesbian bar in town open 24/7. The Las Vegas Eagle/Lipstick is located near the corner of South Pecos Road at 3430 East Tropicana Avenue, Suite #41, Las Vegas, Nevada 89121-7349.

"The Strip in Las Vegas, Las Vegas","Nevada","The Strip in Las Vegas, Las Vegas","There are only 3.8 miles that encompass the area known as The Strip in Las Vegas, bit a lot is packed into that distance. The well known sign that tells everyone Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas Nevada is an icon. The boundaries start at Russell Road on the South to Sahara Avenue on the North end. While some of The Strip is in the town of Las Vegas, some of it is in Paradise and Winchester. These are unincorporated areas. The Strip has nineteen hotels with the largest room count. There are only twenty five in the world that can make this claim. When totaled together, The Strip has more than 67,000 rooms. The road has had another name before it became known as The Strip. It was originally named the Arrowhead Highway or Los Angeles Highway. Supposedly a L.A. police officer coined the name The Strip'' after Los Angeles' own Sunset Strip. The Stratosphere Hotel is at the northern boundary of The Strip and at this time the Mandalay Bay is considered the southern end. Before the Mandalay Bay was built it ended at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino. While the Pair-O-Dice Club was built in 1931 and was the first casino on Nevada Highway 91 it isn't considered the first casino on The Strip. That honor goes to the El Rancho Vegas in 1941. This hotel and casino boasted forty one rooms. A fire consumed the hotel in 1960. After this first hotel the Hotel Last Frontier came along in 1942 followed by the Flamingo in 1946. Although the Flamingo has seen many changes it is still on the Las Vegas Strip. One of the largest hotels on The Strip opened in 1969 with the name of the International Hotel. It is the Las Vegas Hilton today. There were 1,512 rooms when the doors were first opened. There have been many famous performers throughout the years that helped make the Las Vegas Strip a world- wide name. Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr. and Wayne Newton are just a few of the well known names that have entertained in the many theaters along The Strip. Many of the hotels have tried to have amusement parks or arcades, but only a few have succeeded. This brought children into what had previously been a town for adults. The prices for the rooms, inexpensive buffets and amusements for the children made it a family vacation destination. There is a mixture on The Strip today with the hotels, casinos, shopping and gentlemen's clubs all co-existing. Boutique shops, jewelry stores such as Cartier and many designer clothing stores are all along the famous Strip. Some are located in the hotels while others have their own venues such as the Fashion Show Mall. A sixty six acre City Center has been under construction since 2006. It is supposed to be finished in 2009. This mega complex will house a hotel, casino, retail shops and condos. There may be other things on the site as well.

Some places that advertised themselves as the best in Laughlin'' could not help disappoint. But at $19.99 a night the Tropicana's rooms offer so much more luxury than rooms of the other resorts along the Colorado River, that one only wonders why anybody would stay anywhere else. The other hotels' rooms look like your typical Holiday Inn's. The Tropicana's rooms boast beds with Dynasty mattresses, 300-thread count sheets, and mounds of pillows; its bathrooms boast granite countertops; and its windows boast plantation shutters. The Tropicana's restaurants are a cut above the competition's as well. You can't escape a buffet at the Tropicana, but you won't find a Burger King here either. Instead, the hotel offers an excellent steakhouse, good Italian and Mexican restaurants, and decent diner fare among the menus at its five restaurants. Bars, of course, are everywhere. The entertainment, with such acts as Los Lonely Boys in its 9,000 square foot facility, is a step above the competition's. Even the shopping is better here, with such stores as The Boutique, The WOW Store (for Wonderful, Outrageous, and Wacky gifts), a gift shop, a smoke shop, and a shop where you can buy toothpaste. Every resort needs a theme of course, and the theme of the Tropicana is trains. An old steam engine will pull you around the Tropicana's 27-acre estate; train memorabilia are on display; one of the bars, which is train-themed, is naturally enough called the Caboose. Oh - and you can gamble at the Tropicana too, at one of the more than 1,000 slot and video poker games, or at the tables set up for the usual array of games, including blackjack, craps, roulette, Ultimate Texas Hold `em, Let it Ride, Three Card Poker, and Wild Hold `em Fold `em. They hold poker tournaments, such as No Limit Thursday Night, and, every Saturday, The Bounty Hunter, where ten hardy souls can start playing Texas Hold `Em as early as 8:00 in the morning, and work off last night's hangover over a hearty breakfast, while sitting in the middle of the Colorado River. As with any hotel, reviews of the Tropicana are a mixed bag, ranging from complaints of bedbugs to grumbles about not getting requested rooms. Even so, the consensus of visitors is on having had a very positive experience. One will probably find, as one guest did following a week spent at another of Laughlin's hotels, After the train wreck of staying at the Golden Nugget, this place was a breath of fresh air.''"

"Vegas Vic","Nevada","Vegas Vic","Introduced by the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce in 1947, Vegas Vic was created to be the city's mascot and a symbol of its frontier hospitality. The chamber commissioned Young Electric Sign Company to create a neon sign of the cowboy character. When completed, it weighed 12,000 pounds and stood 75-feet tall. It was originally installed on Fremont Street in front of the Pioneer Club, where it could overlook Casino Center and the city's first Helldorado Parade. Towering above the downtown streets, it could be seen from far and wide, beckoning visitors and seeming to say, Howdy Pardner.  Today, the Pioneer Club is gone, but the Vegas Vic sign still stands at its corner under the canopy of the Fremont Street experience. The huge cowboy's pose is unmistakable, standing upright, legs crossed at the shin, weight on one leg, as he calls attention to himself with a cupped hand and extended thumb with one hand and seems to point down to the fun below with the other. He looks relaxed and friendly, one eye winking, wearing a big smile, a ten-gallon hat, a bandana around his neck, a plaid long-sleeved shirt, blue jeans, a belt with a big buckle, and boots with spurs. In his mouth is a lit cigarette Over time, the Vegas Vic sign was joined downtown by a neon cowgirl, Sassy Sally. She still reclines and kicks up one leg across the street at Glitter Gulch. Both can be seen near the corner of 1st Street and Fremont. The neon is lit on both sides of the signs at night for good viewing from any angle."

Of the 20 largest hotels in the country, 17 of them can be found in Las Vegas. While size is important to a city that is host to 30,000,000 tourists and convention goers each year, luxury is also an important consideration for many visiting the city. The Venetian Hotel and Casino, which opened in 1999, does not disappoint in either size or luxury.  There are over 4,000 rooms in this all suite hotel, including some of the biggest suites in Vegas. The over-the-top suites are up to 1500 square feet in size (the smallest is a still impressive 650 square feet), and some have amenities such as a concierge, private entrance, walk-in-closets, sunken living room and a fountain . The hotel also boasts 17 restaurants as well as 24-hour room service, a bar, fully equipped gym, a pool, 50,000 square feet of shopping, an extensive art collection and other features that travelers love. By some standards, the 120,000 square foot casino area, while adequate, doesn't match the glitz of the hotel. High rollers can use points earned on the slot machines to comp their suite. There is an entire room that is dedicated to poker with over 24 tables available for use. There is also a lounge with live music offerings. The Venetian also has a feature that few hotels can match: A hotel within the hotel. The Venezia Tower, is a $275 million addition that includes over 1,000 suites, a wedding chapel, 2 pools, private gardens and an outdoor shower . The rooms, while luxurious, are also reasonably affordable. Suites start at under $200 per night and special packages are often available. While not the largest hotel in Vegas (that honor goes to the MGM Grand with over 5,000 rooms) it is the largest to earn the AAA Five Diamond rating. If the casino, the shopping or the lounge doesn't interest guests, they can catch a Broadway style show. The Phantom of the Opera opened at the Venetian in 2006 and is still one of the most popular shows in the city . The Venetian includes much of what most people come to Vegas for, and some guests probably find no reason to leave the hotel when they visit. For luxury rooms, shows, gambling and fine dining in Vegas, the Venetian is a good bet."

"Wild Island Family Adventure Park","Nevada","Wild Island Family Adventure Park - Sparks, Nevada - Water Park, Bowling Alley, Mini-Golf and a Mini-Racing Course All in One","After a few days of sightseeing and gambling in Reno, NV, it's hard to see how you could go wrong taking the kids for an afternoon to Wild Island Family Adventure Park in nearby Sparks. A water park! Bowling! Billiards! Mini-golf! Mini-racing! For a thirteen-year-old weary of television and Nintendo and panoramas of the Sierras, what's not to like about all that? Wild Island, which opened in 1989, has more than two acres of the stuff: Body flumes, tube slides, and speed slides; a kids' pool, with nice cabanas for parents to view their children from the shade. There's a wave pool and a lazy river. There are water rides with names like The Scorpion, The Black Widow, and The Red Viper; Hurricane Cove; Tortuga; The Eye of the Dragon, and The Dragon's Tail. For the grownups there's an outdoor spa with a Jacuzzi. And that's just the water. There are two go-kart tracks at Wild Island, featuring both sprint and Indy cars, where you can test your skills against a backdrop mural of wild animals in the jungle; and 40 lanes in the bowling alley (not to mention glow bowling 7 nights a week); 36 holes of mini-golf complete with miniature Victorian houses and castles and waterfalls (as well as night golfing if you want). You can jump into bumper cars or toss a few ringers in the horse shoe pit. Indeed, you can blow quite a wad on those thirteen-year-olds, in the gift shop or at the largest redemption arcade in Northern Nevada, or on the food, because hot dog stands find a place at Wild Island, and snack bars and cafes and a banquet room for birthday parties. You can also blow a wad on yourself. In addition to its Jacuzzi, Wild Island has kept the money-spenders in mind with three over-21 venues for drinking beer, wine, and tropical cocktails. As fun parks go, Wild Island is immaculately kept, with fresh paint, manicured lawns and blooming gardens, lovely trees, and pretty fountains. The rides are in top shape. The cabana area has been upgraded. New rides have been installed. As with most businesses in a sluggish economy, it's possible for patrons to take advantage of new promotions - in the case of Wild Island, with better deals on season passes that include discounts on mini-golf, go-karts, and bowling, as well as priority for cabana use and birthday party bookings. Reviews of Wild Island are, of course, all over the map, from absolutely loved it,'' and really enjoyed our visit,'' to big disappointments at finding the park closed for a private party'' and WON'T be going back.'' In the end though, what does it matter? What else are you going to do with your child after three days in Reno?"

"Wolf Creek Golf Club","Nevada","Wolf Creek Golf Club, Mesquite, Nevada - A Course That's Been Called ``Nevada's Ultimate Golf Experience''","Wolf Creek Golf Club is carved out of the Nevada desert in the northeast corner of Mesquite, where green fairways wind through valleys nestled between russet-colored mountains and rugged desert terrain. As expected for such a venue, the course features elevation changes of up to 100 feet, accompanied by some spectacular views. The 18-hole, par-72 layout, which opened in 2000, plays to 7,018 yards from the longest tees. From the Challenger Tees,'' the course sports a USGA rating of 75.4 and a slope rating of 154, ranking it as one of the most difficult in the country. From the Masters'' (White) tees, it's a much more friendly rating of 68.2 and slope rating of 134. On such a course, many holes vie for the word signature,'' and some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3. This par-3 hole plays up to 227 yards from the longest tees, and 175 yards from both the Blue and White tees. It's all carry over rugged desert terrain, and the hole tends to play much longer than the yardage, to an elevated green guarded by bunkers and a sloping left side. Hole No. 7 is one of the most scenic on the course and requires some strategy off the tee. A short par-4, this hole plays to only 302 yards from the longest tees and a drivable 263 from the White tees. The problem is the wide stream that cuts in front of the green, which is further guarded by two large bunkers on the right. Hole No. 8 is another picturesque and challenging par-3. The hole plays to a lengthy 248yards from the back tees, but a much more manageable 152 from the Whites. The putting surface is nestled amid rocky hills and surrounded by a stream that arcs around it, making it essentially a peninsula green. Hole No. 14 is the most photographed on the course. This par-4 plays to 444 yards from the back tees and 367 yards from the Whites. What makes it so picturesque and challenging is a curving fairway that sits upon a plateau and is guarded by six large successive fairway bunkers on the left, inward part of the curve. Further left is a steep drop-off into some rugged, rocky terrain, which gets even steeper around the green. Upon reaching Hole No. 17, players might forget they're playing a desert course, as water comes very much into play. This par-5 hole plays to 562 yards from the back tees and a respectable 511 yards from the Whites. The fairway is divided into two landing areas by a creek that cuts across it, and from the second area golfers take aim at a peninsula green fronted by a wide stream. Wolf Creek has received a good deal of acclaim over the years, including being named America's Best New Course by Golf Digest in 2002. It also has the distinction of being one of the featured courses, and the only one from Nevada, to be featured in the Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 09 computer golf game.
