The mountain has the highest vertical ski drop in the east, the mountain now features Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway II, which is 5,359 feet ascending the mountain, and travels at 1,500 feet per minute and can accommodate 770 passengers in either direction. An average of 160 inches of snow falls at the mountain each season, the storms in Franconia can be erratic though so the ski area has to be able to provide visitors with excellent snow no matter the weather. The mountain is able to create quality snow and have it groomed to provide a safe skiing area. Snowmaking happens at any hour on the mountain, the grooming work is done at night to not interrupt skiers during the day. The mountain's base is at an elevation of 1900 feet with the ski summit area 4080 feet; the temperature of the mountain is around 15-20 degrees colder then the town of Franconia. The snowmaking team has to constantly monitor conditions to make the best snow possible. The mountain uses water from Echo Lake, as the lake is replenished as quickly as it is pumped out, even as the mountain pumps 3000 gallons per minute from the lake. The water is pumped through 16 miles of pipes with valves around the mountain where the snow is to be pumped. The mountain uses three types of snow guns to groom the snow. To avoid the occurrence of moguls from skiers the groomers use a large tractor with a front blade and tiller to smooth out the snow and distribute it evenly. A new pub opened in recent years at the mountain, The Cannonball Pub is 3000 square foot addition to Peabody Base Lodge. The pub is opened during the winter and features a 100 foot long bar, a full menu including apris ski parties and entertainment each weekend.

It is currently considered to be one of the best value parks for families in the entire New England area. It is also widely known and acclaimed for the natural beauty of its landscaping that includes a beautiful front entry plaza and an 80-year-old spruce tree.

"Casino Ballroom has hosted many entertainers for over 100 years","New-Hampshire","Casino Ballroom has hosted many entertainers for over 100 years","The Casino Ballroom is located at Hampton Beach in New Hampshire. The ballroom has hosted many entertainers of all different styles for over 100 years. It is one of the best kept secrets on the East Coast of the United States. The ballroom recently underwent renovations and is a landmark of Hampton Beach. Performers who have played the ballroom include Led Zeppelin, The Doors and Janice Joplin. The ballroom expanded in 1927 to meet the changing nature of entertainment and to hold 5,000 people and to have the largest dance floor in New England. Up to 20,000 people used the large space each week. Many changes were required at the ballroom after an unruly incident at a Jethro Tull concert where fans without tickets attempted to enter the ballroom in any way possible and this led to rock and roll concerts being banned in Hampton. After this incident the ballroom was sold to a facility of local businessmen who were going to restore the ballroom to its former glory. The ballroom was restored to many of its original features and reopened in the 1970s as a Club Casino; this however, did not draw promoters back to the venue as they were worried about another incident happening such as what happened at the Jethro Tull concert. The owners then booked small name bands, at the time, such as U2, Ray Charles and Tom Jones to restore their reputation. This paid off and after further renovation in the late 70's, which then led to bookings of entertainers such as Melissa Etheridge and Jerry Seinfeld. The ballroom became so popular that up to 50 events were held in a three month period, this was unheard of at the time for music halls. More renovations were required as the previous renovations were out-dated and the club has a reputation for having tough bouncers and strict dancing rules. The name was then changed back to Hampton Beach Casino Ballroom to gain back some of its past popularity. The hotel next to the ballroom was demolished and the fasade of the building was changed. The ballroom was now ready for its first concert in 1995, the RatDog concert. Memories of the Jethro Tull incident lingered as the concert was held the day that Jerry Garcia died and a large amount of media and fans descended on the ballroom. No incident occurred due to improved security and customer service. The ballroom was now ready to provide the people of Hampton and visitors to the town with another decade of entertainment service."

"Portsmouth Country Club","New-Hampshire","Portsmouth Country Club, Greenland, New Hampshire ? a Fabulous Oceanside Course Designed to Play Like a Scottish Links by Robert Trent Jones","As the story goes, a group of businessmen wanted to have their own place to golf, and in 1901 established the Portsmouth Country Club. The original nine-hole course was built in five weeks and the businessmen were golfing. Nine more holes were added 32 years later, but in the 1950s, the U.S. Government decided to build a bomber base in New Hampshire. They took the golf course property under eminent domain,'' and the course was forced to find a new location. New property was purchased and legendary golf course architect Robert Trent Jones was brought in to lay out an 18-hole course, which eventually opened for play in 1957. The new Portsmouth'' course is designed to play similar to Scottish links-style courses, and features a good variety of challenging holes. Like those Scottish courses, wind is often a factor on the course, which has been called a fabulous oceanside course.'' Located in the Seacoast region of New Hampshire, the course plays along Great Bay for many of its holes. The fairways are wide, but most holes require a tee shot from out of a chute. Water hazards come into play on five of the holes. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,050 yards from its longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 127 on Bent grass. It's been said that it's difficult to pick out a best'' or most scenic'' hole, but No. 4 always gets some consideration. This par-5 plays to only 494 yards from the longest tees, but ranks as the #1-handicap hole on the course. The most scenic hole on the course, as rated by a poll of club members, is said to be No. 14. This par-5 plays to 490 yards from the Gold tees and features a dogleg left with about 220 yards left to the green. For most players, the second shot will play over the corner of the marsh that surrounds Great Bay to a green protected by sand traps right and left and water on three sides. Throughout its long history, Portsmouth Golf Club has received a number of accolades, including Golf Digest ranking it the 4th-Best Course in New Hampshire. Practice facilities include a driving range, along with chipping and putting areas. There's also a green (old alternate No. 18), which can be used to practice chipping and sand bunker shots. Portsmouth also features a new clubhouse that opened in 1998, with dining available at The Clipper Lounge."

"Squam Lakes Natural Science Center","New-Hampshire","Squam Lakes Natural Science Center - Holderness, New Hampshire - small zoo and wildlife center","Since its opening in July, 1969, the Squam Lake Natural Science Center of New Hampshire has followed its goal to educate the general public about New Hampshire's natural world. The Natural Science Center grew out of the desire of local residents to preserve the area's natural assets. In 1965, they gathered to discuss plans and raise money to help preserve nature. By 1966, the group had raised enough money to purchase 180 acres and incorporate as a non-profit organization. In the two years that followed, the board of directors was formed, and the original mission statement was written. That mission statement included the education of children in the natural sciences and to become a natural sciences education center. When the Squam Lake Natural Science Center opened in 1969, it consisted of a barn auditorium, two nature trails with live animal exhibits and three exhibits showing the daily life of early New Hampshire settlers. The Science Center began its pilot school education program in September of 1969, holding sessions in the basement of the director's home. The kitchen of the Holderness Inn, purchased with the original property, was converted to house the animals used for lectures - a total of 20 birds, 13 mammals and 25 reptiles. In the years since, the Natural Science Center has continued to expand and grow even as it refined its mission statement and its mission. In 2006, the Center gained accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, recognizing its excellence in the field of natural science conservation and education. It is the only AZA accredited facility in Northern New England. Squam Lake offers 15 animal exhibits and three nature trails. Many of the exhibits are in the natural environment, while others are learning centers that bring education indoors. They include the Introductory Exhibit, which introduces visitors to the main concepts behind conservation, and the popular Gordon Children's Activity Center, where children can get a more hands-on understanding of natural concepts. The Activity Center includes an underground tunnel, a crawling web and other activities for children. The Raptor Exhibit is another popular exhibit. Spread out over several buildings, it focuses only on birds that are raptors - owls, falcons, kestrel, and hawks. Beyond the buildings, nature trails take visitors into the marshes and woods to explore the natural world and see plants and animals native to this area of New England. The Marsh Boardwalk, a popular place to walk at this location, is a wooden walkway over a man made wetland into the woods and marsh. Three hiking trails range in length from 1/3 of a mile to over 1 mile, and take hikers through fields, forest, and mountains.

"The Balsams, Panorama Course, Dixville Notch, New Hampshire - a Donald Ross Signature Design, and One of the Oldest and Most Storied Golf Courses in New England","New-Hampshire","The Balsams, Panorama Course, Dixville Notch, New Hampshire - a Donald Ross Signature Design, and One of the Oldest and Most Storied Golf Courses in New England","The Panorama Course at the Balsams Resort is a Donald Ross signature golf course built in 1912, making it one of the oldest and most storied golf courses in New England. The course is situated on the western slope of Keazer Mountain in the heart of New Hampshire's rugged Great North Woods. The course still features sixteen holes with their original Ross designs and routing, along with the customary Ross trademarks: large fairways and hazards, but not much bunkering, along with large, inverted saucer-shaped greens. According to the locals who know the course the best, that's what this Ross design is about - the last 100 yards to the hole - including hitting the right approach and figuring out the putting surfaces. It's been said about Panorama that that's easier said than done.'' The course provides very few flat lies, while the greens can range from tricky'' to outright confounding'' and are also difficult to hold on approach shots. Ross liked to choose his green locations before laying out the rest of the course, and many of Panorama's greens are carved directly into hillsides or set on knolls and ridges. The greens are also rarely on the same level as the fairways. The 18-hole, par-72 courses plays to about 6,800 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 72.8 and a slope rating of 130. For an older course that made use of the natural topography, rather than bulldozers, there's a good variety of golf shots on the course. There are also some spectacular, 40-mile mountain views, beautiful foliage, and the added challenge provided by the mountain winds. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 11, a par-4 that features a tee shot to a wide landing area. What makes this hole so challenging is the approach shot that follows. It plays to an elevated green that falls away sharply to the back left, making it the most difficult approach on the course. Perhaps just as challenging are the par-3 holes on the course, which some consider more demanding than the par-4s. Hole No. 5 is a prime example, as the tee shot calls for a forced carry over a tarn'' (mountain lake) to a wide, flat green, which often features a difficult, tucked-away'' pin placement. Two more noteworthy holes are the finishing holes for each nine. Hole No. 9 is the most-photographed on the course. This par-4 plays uphill to a green perched atop a natural dome that sits beside a man-made lake. Hole No. 18 features an even steeper uphill approach to a green where golfers may not even be able to see the flag. Over the years, Panorama has received its share of honors and awards, and Golf Digest consistently ranks the course the best public course in the state. The Balsams Resort is located a few minutes down the road from the golf course, and features a 15,000-acre estate that also offers hiking, biking, tennis, swimming and fishing on Lake Gloriette, and swimming at the resort pool. In the winter months, the resort offers skiing, snowshoeing, ice skating and dog sledding."

Some of the most noteworthy holes at The Oaks include its collection of par-3s, which are said to be beautiful. One of them is Hole No. 3, which plays to 200 yards from the back tees, which are stacked and elevated. This hole calls for a forced carry over wetlands that cross in front of the green, which is kidney-shaped and guarded by bunkers and trees situated on a rise at the back. Hole No. 4 has been described as an extremely pretty par-5.'' This hole plays to a lengthy 589 yards from the back tees to a fairway lined with oak trees and an intruding wetland on the left. The second shot plays to a sizable landing area, but the approach shot plays to a small, well-protected green. According to reviewers, Hole No. 9 is spectacular.'' This par-4 plays to 417 yards from the longest tees, with a fairway lined on both sides by trees. Two bunkers, spaced about 30-40 yards apart, guard the right side of the fairway, and the approach shot plays to a green perched atop a plateau amid an amphitheater surrounded by oaks.'' The finishing hole on the course is also its longest, playing to 590 yards from the back tees. This par-5 begins with a short wetlands crossing to a fairway guarded on the left by more wetlands and a pond.

"USS Albacore Museum","New-Hampshire","USS Albacore Museum, Portsmouth, NH","The USS Albacore Museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire is a submarine that has been turned into a tourist attraction. The story of the USS Albacore is an interesting one dating to the early 1900's. The USS Albacore between 1939 and 1945 had the most success as a submarine force destroying 1,314 ships along with other subs in the force. The US Submarine Force with the Gato, Balao, and Tench classes had 15,000 officers and enlisted men to force Japan to surrender. The force suffered a loss of 52 subs due to the Japanese, though they had 288 subs. The USS Albacore was one of the lost ships, which occurred in November of 1944. It hit a mine and went down with all hands on board. The USS Albacore was not strictly a sub. The first was a carrier named Albacore, which was the one lost in 1944. The history of submarines is imperative to understand why the USS Albacore could be a submarine and a carrier. Back in 1917 when the ship was built submarines acted as surface ships that could potentially go beneath the water for a few minutes. After the war experiments were completed to try and make subs better. As part of this the Albacore name was resurrected to create an aerodynamic boat with a rounded hull. Several versions were made trying to make the submarine a better ship to travel unnoticed in the water. It is the conical shaped ship that sits in the shipyard as a museum. This submarine was decommissioned in 1972 and placed at the Inactive Ship Facility in Philadelphia. Later the Portsmouth City Council decided to get the ship back to its homeland, but it would take until 1985 for the ship to be dismantled and towed to Portsmouth. It took six months and many locks before the ship could be cradled in Albacore Park. Visitors to the museum will begin their tour outside before going inside. At the entrance are a series of panels with push buttons to take the self guide audio tour. There are also eleven sites within the Albacore that narrate its story. The park is open from 9:30am to 5pm in summer and 4pm in winter. During summer the park is open seven days a week. In winter the days are Thursday through Monday. Adults are $5 and Children are $3.

The submarine is not in water, but sits on the land where it is possible to take photos of the outside and walk up to it to see how immense it actually is. The park provides a nice leisurely stroll in the sun along the Portsmouth harbor area."
