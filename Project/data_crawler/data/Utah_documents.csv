During the summer season, the wildflowers and high peaks can be enjoyed in the cool mountain air of the Wasatch Mountains. The lodge specializes in arrangements for groups. They have facilities for everything from a romantic wedding to a business meeting or conference. One May 2009 reviewer said, Skied here for a week at end of March and ended up skiing IN the best powder we have ever experienced. Everything about this resort is lovely - no queues, lovely and friendly staff everywhere, no snowboarders (!!!!) and dreamy white stuff. This is our favorite ski destination in the world. We loved the hot chocolates at Alf's Restaurant, and the fact that you can park right next to the first chairlift was great - especially at the end of a long day. The road up was great and felt safe even when driving in the snow.'' Another reviewer said, I've been skiing since the 60's, and I've been to all the major North American resorts plus a few of Europe's best. Simply put, Alta is the best there is for skiers who want the most and the best snow, and for skiers who want a great variety of serious terrain. I'm okay with snowboarders elsewhere, but whenever I come back to Alta, the snow is so much better; I sometimes wonder why I go anywhere else. The easy access via S.L.C. airport means more skiing and less flying/airport hassles. I usually stay in Sandy and drive up daily.''"

Finally...I convinced him to take us to The Beav. I can not believe we wasted so much time driving to other resorts! We had a blue bird day with fresh snow. There were no crowds and for the price paid it just does not get any better. We'll be back!!!!!!!!'' Another online reviewer said, I've raised my kids skiing at the Beav. If you are looking for fast lifts and leg busting bumps, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for some great tree skiing, a place where you can relax with your kids and enjoy skiing the way it was before $70+ lift tickets, this is the perfect spot. You can even afford to buy lunch in the lodge without a second mortgage, and my kids claim the Beav makes the best French fries in the world. The groomers can be a little boring, but with the help of a cheap ski instructor, you can ski the whole day on back country style runs and never see the same spot twice. Ski the Beav!''"

One August 2009 reviewer said, A must see for animal lovers & people who watch Dogtown. We took the free tour and had a great time.'' A second 2009 reviewer said, Being in a place where everyone-staff, volunteers and visitors-are there solely for love of animals was a rare, precious experience, especially for someone who has spent a lot of time in poorly managed, politics-ridden city animal shelters. The quiet tranquility and the beauty of Angel Canyon just adds to the peacefulness and spirituality of the place. We stayed in one of the cottages on the property, which I highly recommend because you are right there in the middle of everything. Also, we took one of the dogs for an overnight sleepover, which was also a delicious experience! Very close to major national parks like Zion and Bryce. We didn't make it to Bryce, but Zion is breathtaking and even just the drive from Zion to Kanab is worth it! Overall, an amazing, precious experience that we definitely plan to repeat again in the future.''"

Everything is clean and went as planned. Not sure about the Switchback restaurant. Didn't try it but looked expensive. After viewing the morning buffet and the price, we walked down to Oscar's and had a great breakfast. One minor issue was that no one answered some general questions to help in our travels.

There were a couple of things that may sound minor but it was kind of a big deal to me. We stayed for three nights in early July and decided we would take advantage of the frig and microwave in our room and make some quick meals ourselves. (Eating establishments in Springdale are expensive.) There was only one small trash can in the bathroom. Two times during our stay we had to pack up trash and throw it in the dumpster ourselves. This was really irritating to me. I figured they should have a trash can near the microwave. I should have asked management for another trash can but we were so busy I forgot. Walls were a little thin. Not horribly though, a few times I heard taking from the adjacent room but I guess I was fortunate that they did not keep late hours. Free Wi-Fi was good for my teenage daughter. The location was excellent being practically in the center of town and close to the shuttle stop. Overall was a good stay just irritated with the trash situation.'' Another online reviewer from July 2009 said, We drove into Springdale anxious because we hadn't made reservation anywhere and it was HOT! And we were tired. Saw the Bumbleberry Inn from the road, pulled in and lucked into a fantastic place. Reasonably priced, large clean homey room. But then we saw the balcony and the view! Spent two perfect evenings with takeout dinner and a bottle of wine watching the sun set on the mountainside. Perfection!''"
"Big Rock Candy Mountain","Utah","Big Rock Candy Mountain - Marysvale, Utah - Geological formation","Big Rock Candy Mountain is altered volcanic rock in various shades of yellow, orange, red, and white. The yellow, orange, and red colors come from the presence of iron minerals, such as jarosite, hematite, and pyrite. The white color is from minerals rich in potassium like alunite and kaolinite. Then through a complex chemical process involving hydrogen sulfide, steam, ground water, and oxygen - the volcanic rock was partially altered or totally replaced. The vivid colors in Big Rock Candy Mountain are the direct result of this mineralization. Peak Elevation is 6,962 feet. The mountain got its name from a song released in 1928. An excerpt of the song lyrics are, Near the soda water fountain, At the lemonade springs, Where the bluebird sings, On the big rock candy mountain.'' Shortly after the release of the song a few local residents placed a sign at the base of the mountain as a joke, naming it Big Rock Candy Mountain.'' Then they put a sign next to a nearby spring identifying it as Lemonade Springs.'' The names stuck, and the mythical mountain is one of the most recognized geologic sites in west-central Utah. The mountain is located about six miles north of Marysvale in Piute County. To get there from Salt Lake City, travel south on I- 15, to I-70 (exit 132). Turn left (east) onto I-70 for a little over twenty two miles, to exit 23. Turn right (south) onto U.S. Highway 89 for 7.6 miles to view Big Rock Candy Mountain from a distance. Then travel an additional 0.6 miles to the Big Rock Candy Mountain Resort. Across from the mountain is the Candy Mountain Resort. This resort has Log Cabins, a motel, an RV Park and tent sites. From a June 2009 reviewer, So you're driving through rural central Utah, looking at the beautiful scenery and scary abandoned buildings. You come around a bend a couple miles north of Marysvale and find the Big Rock Candy Mountain resort, which is a very pleasant surprise. The rooms are clean and huge, no bugs to be found, everyone is extremely friendly. They eschew the omnipresent rustic cabin theme in Utah for a normal hotel-feel, which is nice. The on-site restaurant is great and open at all hours. The same resort rents ATVs from a gas station/tourist center across the street, and there are literally thousands of miles of trails in the hills and plains in the area to cruise around in and explore. It's really fun, made more fun by how unexpected it is. They did a very good job with everything and incredibly my wife and I will probably return to hit the trails again.''"
"Bonneville Salt Flats","Utah","Bonneville Salt Flats - Wendover, Utah - Raceway, Timed speed trials, geological site","The Bonneville Salt Flats stretches over 30,000 acres. These public lands are managed by the Bureau of Land Management. In many areas the depth of the salt has been recorded at over six feet. The Bonneville Salt Flats and the Great Salt Lake are remnants of ancient Lake Bonneville. In a revolving cycle, every winter a shallow layer of standing water floods the surface of the salt flats. Then during the spring and summer, the water slowly evaporates. Wind blows, smoothing the surface into a vast, nearly perfect flat plain. The salt surface contains potassium, magnesium lithium and sodium chloride (common table salt). Made famous by high speed racers and commercial filmmakers, each year thousands of visitors descend on the salt flats for Bonneville Speed Week. Since the first speed record attempt in 1914, hundreds of records have been set and broken on the flats. Since 1949, this raceway has been considered the standard course for world land speed records. On this natural straightaway the 300, 400, 500, and 600 mile per hour land speed barriers were broken. Speed trials are typically scheduled throughout the summer and fall with most events open to the public. The annual Speed Week is usually held in mid-August. Every rainfall on the salt flats erases tire marks and flattens the densely-packed salt pan. This salt pan is completely inhospitable to plants. Bonneville Salt Flats is located along I-80 on the Utah side of the Utah-Nevada border. The raceway is just a few miles from Wendover, Nevada and is roughly a two hour drive from Salt Lake City. Due to the Salt Flats unique geology, history, and scenic beauty, this area was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern in 1985. Here are some tips to follow when visiting. These guidelines will help preserve the Bonneville Salt Flats. Appearances are deceiving - Stay on existing roads or areas designated for vehicles. The salt might look hard, but much of the area is a thin salt crust over soft mud. It's very easy to get stuck in this mud. Salt water is highly corrosive - Stay off the salt surface when it is covered by water. Not only is the wet salt surface soft and easily damaged by vehicles, the salt water can short-out the electrical system in your vehicle. Temperatures fluctuate - This is the desert. Temperatures can exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer and drop well below 0 in the winter. It can be very hot during the day and cool or even cold at night. No bathrooms or water available - There are no facilities or services on the salt flats. During racing events there are portable toilets and some water. No camping allowed - Overnight stays on the salt flats are prohibited. Camping is available nearby. One online reviewer said, It has miles of hard, white, salt- a perfect surface for driving a car as fast as it will go. Some wheel- driven cars have topped 450mph! The landscape is so flat and expansive that you can actually see the curvature of the earth. Speed Week is held every August; it is popular with racers and car enthusiasts-500 cars have run there the last few years. There are no grandstands, no big prize money, just racers out there having fun and going fast. This is the way racing used to be.''"
"Bonneville SeaBase","Utah","Bonneville SeaBase - Grantsville, Utah - Scuba, Snorkel, tropical fish, diving lessons","There is no ocean in Utah, but there is Bonneville SeaBase. A commercial scuba and snorkel site near Grantsville, it serves as Utah's inland ocean. This site was originally a series of warm, salt-water springs-the hot-pots have been deepened, enlarged, and interconnected. The shoreline and bottom were stabilized to reduce silt in the water. Then tropical fish were added. Really big tropical fish. Now the four interconnected ponds form SeaBase. These pools vary in temperature, depth, fish life, and visibility. The salt water in these ponds is almost as salty as the ocean. Because there are no natural currents and plenty of sunshine, algae will build up in the summertime. This means the water is light green in color and visibility is better in the winter and early spring. At this site you can swim year-round in warm salt water with large tropical fish. Here is a breakdown of the ponds: White Rocks Bay - is the most popular pond. It is nine to twelve feet across. Most of the fish are in this pond. The temperature in this pond varies from place to place, usually running between 72 and 80 degrees. There is a dome over the water entry area for gearing up and entering the water out of the weather. There is also a Plexiglas cover protecting the pond. This cover helps trap warmth and reduce algae growth. Depth in this pond is seventeen feet. Water entry and exit is via a ladder inside the dome. Habitat Bay - is connected to White Rocks Bay by a swim-through tunnel. Exposed to surface winds, the upper water is cooler. Visibility varies around five to nine feet. This pond has a concrete water entry and exit ramp with handrail. There is a giant-stride entry platform, a four foot platform and twenty three foot platform for scuba instruction. You'll find an underwater habitat at fifteen feet. Maximum depth in this pond is around twenty five feet. In the south end of this bay there is a sunken twenty two foot cabin cruiser called the Sheer Joy, you can explore inside it. Grantsville Trench - connects Habitat Bay to Iron Bottom Bay, which then connects to Bubbling Sands Bay. These bays are small and fairly shallow and the bottom is covered with pond weed. Temperature remains around 74 degrees here, with visibility of six to nine feet. There are few fish and some large shrimp for viewing, these areas are great places to practice underwater navigation. SeaBase is usually open from 9am to dusk, Thursday through Monday. Normally closed Tuesday and Wednesday, special arrangements can be made for group dives on these days. Full dive services are available, including replacement parts, rentals, lessons, air fills, Nitrox, and rebreathers. There is a small snack shop and dive store available, indoor and outdoor eating areas, classrooms, warm-water showers, freshwater rinse tanks, and heated changing rooms. There are small trailers available for overnighters. There is a daily dive fee that allows you to dive all day and special activities such as night dives or shark feeding available for an additional charge. To get to SeaBase, take I-80 west out of Salt Lake. Take the second Grantsville exit (Exit 84) to U-138. Turn left and drive five miles. Bonneville SeaBase is just off the highway on your left. The physical address is 9390 West Highway 138, Grantsville, Utah. Tips for visiting: -Multiple divers affect the visibility in these ponds; weekdays are the best for diving. -Classes aren't allowed in White Rocks Bay so this stays fairly clear even when there are people in the other ponds. -White Rocks Bay is where most of the fish hang out. The fish have been taught to come up to shallow for feeding, so snorkeling is great. -Invest in some Romaine lettuce to bring with you to use as fish food. Instead of watching the fish swim by, you'll be mobbed by dozens of the biggest tropical fish you've ever seen. -You must have your certification card. -No dogs. -No smoking. -You must view a 15-minute video and sign release form before diving or snorkeling. -There are rebreathers and Nitrox available on site. -Classes to learn to scuba and for advanced skills are available. -Great place to practice your fish photography. -The fish are used to divers, and come right up to you. -There are several nurse sharks, with the largest over six feet in length. One online reviewer said, Bring your older children, they can snorkel under the dome of White Rocks Bay with untold swarms of small fish. They'll enjoy discovering the giant shrimp among the rocks and will never forget feeding the big tropical fish. It is important you visit SeaBase with appropriate expectations. This isn't the ocean. These are salt-water ponds. On a bad day, algae and silt can reduce the visibility to a few feet.''"

This online reviewer said, This Spring Break I had the opportunity to go to Las Vegas to see my sister. While we were there she took us to Brian Head for a night. Being a southern girl from Mississippi I was in heaven with all of the snow. We arrived at night and stayed up late playing games. The next day we went out to ski and go tubing. Unfortunately, because I was a beginner, my sister and I couldn't ski on the same slope so I opted to go tubing with my boyfriend. That was a blast. You wouldn't think a 26 years old and 32 year old would have so much fun just riding down a hill on a tube, but we did. There were people of all ages and it only cost $7 for two hours. Trust me, you won't need to hours unless you are 10. We made it about 45 minutes before we called it quits. Ironically, while we were there we met a family from Oxford, MS (where we live). This is only a town of 10,000 and eight of them were in Brian Head. My sister and her friend spent the day skiing. From their opinions, which are trust worth because they both ski a lot, I gathered that this is a great place to ski. We could have just gone 30 minutes to another mountain, but they opted for the 3 hour trip because it's so much better. If you get bored with all that you can go up the street to Cedar Breaks. Talk about amazing. You can see for miles. I'm not sure I can begin to relay how gorgeous all those snow capped mountains where. All in all, Brian Head was great. One warning, the town DIES at night so bring your own entertainment. But if you want a gorgeous get away spot, Brian Head is the place.''"
"Brighton Ski Resort","Utah","Brighton Ski Resort - Brighton, Utah - Ski Resort, snowboarding, Terrain Parks","Starting with only a rope tow in 1936, today Brighton is the only resort in Utah with 100% of its terrain accessible by high speed quads.

One online reviewer reports, My stay at Brighton (in the lodge to be exact) was perfect. The accommodations were incredibly simple, but being next to the lifts for night riding was where it was at for me!! The locals were incredibly hospitable, and the snow was great too! Thanks to all the Brighton folks that made me feel so welcome!'' Another reviewer said, A boarder's paradise! Though it's hard to contend with Alta's mystique and beauty, Brighton is by far my favorite place to board. This is where the locals go to ski/board. Still an incredibly amazing value compared to the other resorts.''"
"Broken Arch","Utah","Broken Arch - Arches National Park, Utah - Geological Feature","Broken Arch is a feature at Arches National Park, which is five miles north of Moab in Utah along Highway 191. It is approximately four hours from the international airport at Salt Lake City. The Greyhound bus service travels along Interstate 70, making stops at Grand Junction, Colorado and Green River, Utah, whilst commercial van services operate between Moab and Salt Lake City as well as Grand Junction. The park has over 2,000 cataloged natural sandstone arches including the famous Delicate Arch and Broken Arch, as well asmany other unusual rock formations. Arches are defined by having an opening measuring at least three feet in any direction caused by the forces of nature, which in Arches National Park has exposed millions of years of geological history. Visitors here can see a landscape of varying colors, landforms and textures that cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. The Broken Arch trail starts at the Sand Dune Arch parking area or Devils Garden campground across from campsite #40 and is approximately two kilometers in length. This should take between 30 and 60 minutes to hike as it cuts across a large meadow to the arch and continues to the campground. Visitors can extend the trail by taking a loop trail through canyons with sand dunes and slick rock, which will add an extra 1.2 kilometers to the trip. The aforementioned Devils Garden Campground is located eighteen miles from the park entrance and is open throughout the year and can accommodate RV's up to 30 feet in length. Here campers will have access to potable water, picnic tables, grills as well as both pit-style and flush toilets, but there are no showers.

"Cable Mountain Lodge","Utah","Cable Mountain Lodge","Cable Mountain Lodge is located just outside of Zion National Park in Springdale, Utah. Cable Mountain, for which the lodge is named after, was used in the early 1900s for lumber and draw works. A 2,000 foot cable ran up the mountain, allowing logs to be taken from high up to the bottom within two minutes. The trip would have taken 3 days by wagon. The frame used for the cable was destroyed twice by fire in 1911 and 1930. The old works are still there, but they are crumbling away.  At the lodge guests are within walking distance of the draw works and mountain and can also enjoy Zion National Park. Accommodations include king or queen studios, classic or luxury suites. Rooms include 300 thread count sheets, 37 inch flat screens, granite vanities in the bath rooms, mini kitchens, coffee maker, and hair dryers. There are 50 private entry units at Cable Mountain Lodge to offer guests the utmost in privacy. On site are conference facilities, which can be booked for special events or by business guests.

"Calf Creek Falls Recreation Area","Utah","Calf Creek Falls Recreation Area - Escalante, Utah - Nature Reserve, Waterfall","Calf Creek Recreation Site and Campground is at elevation 5,346 feet. Facilities at this site include individual camping units, five individual picnic units, a group picnic area, and a two and three quarter mile (one-way) interpretive trail to the 126-foot Lower Calf Creek Falls. Other developments at this site include a culinary water system, playground equipment, two volleyball courts, and a paved road. There is a paved parking area, vault toilets, and a footbridge across Calf Creek. Camping is available on a first serve basis. Calf Creek Falls is a southern Utah landmark and the major feature of the Bureau of Land Management's Calf Creek Recreation Area. Walking between mineral-streaked cliffs of Navajo Sandstone, hikers pass beaver ponds and pre-historic rock art sites on the way to the 126-foot-high Lower Calf Creek Falls. Mist from falls, and shade provided by the canyon, combine to keep temperatures cool and comfortable even during the hottest of summer days. Roundtrip distance to the falls is five and a half miles. This is a designated nature trail with a pamphlet and numbered stops. You will see Indian ruins, rock art, and historic artifacts. The trail is sandy and slightly uphill, yet suitable for people of all ages if you are physically fit. There are benches along the way. Make sure and take water with you. Once you reach the falls area, there is cool shade. The area is about two hours east of Bryce Canyon National Park between the towns of Escalante and Boulder. This was once the most remote area in the lower 48 states. Boulder is said to have been the last town in the United States to have mail and supply delivery by mule train. Along Utah Highway 12, the recreation area is fifteen and a half miles east of Escalante, Utah. Upper Falls is located further upstream. This is a difficult one-mile hike over sandstone slick rock. You start this hike five and a half miles north of the campground, leaving from the Escalante-Boulder highway. Interesting tips: On this hike you'll see Utah juniper trees (Juniperus osteosperma). Commonly called cedars'' these trees are locally used for fence posts. Juniper seeds or berries'' are eaten by wildlife. Dried seeds are used by Native Americans for making jewelry. You'll also see Pinyon pine trees (Pinus edulis). The Pinyon is popular for Christmas trees and produces an edible nut, long used as a staple food by Indian people and still sold on the roadside today. The nuts are an important food source for rodents and birds. Resin from these trees was also used by Indians to waterproof baskets and to cement turquoise stones to jewelry. A visibly old fence is reminiscent of the settler's early use of Calf Creek. Weaned calves, just taken from their mothers, were turned into the natural pasture created by the box canyon above the fence. Hence the name Calf Creek. From a July 2009 review, Little Calf Creek Falls was a hot hike through the canyon on this July day. My wife and I got started around 10am. The journey took us about 4 hours at a pretty deliberate pace in the heat. Getting to the falls was worth the effort. Loved the mist on this extremely hot day. Had our lunch on a fallen tree and enjoyed the scenery for half an hour. Be sure to stop off on Route 12 for great views of this canyon from above. The round trip is a little less than 6 miles. The trail is mostly level with some sandy sections.'' July 2008 review, I love this hike! I've completed it three times in the last 12 years but I'm always a little confused by so many people saying the hike is easy to moderate. I suppose it is, for some, but I've always found this hike to be more than a little demanding. For those of us who are getting up in years (57) and who take easy little two or three mile hikes every once in a while, the hike to Lower Calf Creek Falls can be very demanding. I've always completed the hike in June or July and it can be grueling when the temperatures soar above 100 degrees and the sandy trail makes every step strenuous. Every time I've completed the hike, I've passed hikers who are hot and exhausted and unable to finish. For those hikers who are a little bit out of shape, be sure to allow at least three or four hours and take plenty of drinking water. I've also found it useful to take a big beach towel, which I can throw down under a spot of shade on the way and take a few minutes to rest before continuing. Be advised that there is only one bench provided for resting about a third of the way to the falls. The falls are always cool and refreshing and appear just when I'm about ready to throw in the towel and provide a fabulous, cool oasis in which to refresh and get energized for the return trip. There's no way I would ever pass up an opportunity to take this inspiring hike but hikers should be aware that it can be quite demanding.''"

Hotel: comfy, big, elegant, cozy, rustic Front desk service: nice, polite, fast Maintenance: very fast (within minutes they came and took care of things) Food: restaurant choice is limited around the hotel. The cabin is expensive but very good and sophisticated. Location: can't beat it. Right next to the gondola. Internet service: wifi in every room available at no cost. Rooms: very spacious, clean, comfy and cozy. Staff: very polite Cleaning maids: on time, polite, did clean work Shuttle: free, available every full hour to Park City. Every half hour would be better, but it was okay.'' A reviewer from February 2009 said, I thought I would write a review on this hotel as there were not many helpful reviews posted. We just returned from a 7 night stay at the grand summit. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. The room was huge with a separate living room that had a dining table, sofa, fire place and flat screen tv. Our bedroom had a king size bed and a flat screen tv. The balcony was quite large but we never used it as it was too cold to sit outside. Our room overlooked to gondola which was lovely as we could see the skiers line up in the morning to board the gondola. The room had a small kitchenette with every thing to cook including dishes, glasses, pots, pans and a wine opener. We ate all our meals out but it was nice to have a refrigerator to store water and snacks. If you are lucky enough to arrive early you can ski for free the day of arrival as long as you fill out the online voucher and show a photo ID. Our room was not ready so we parked our car in the garage and put our ski clothes on in the car. Then left our bags with the valet guy. Its much cheaper to self park and convenient so your not having to wait for the valet to retrieve your vehicle. There were plenty of spaces to park. we always had a spot next to the elevator. The heated pool is large and there are 3 Jacuzzis. The hotel provides hot apple cider, cookies and fruit every late afternoon which was a nice touch. There is also on the 2nd floor a storage area for your skis/board...so all you have to do is walk outside and get on the lift. Service was wonderful and the staff was very friendly. The hotel provided Gilchrist & Soames toiletry which was nice. We ate out at Zoom, Grappas, Riverhorse Cafe, Chimayo and the Purple Sage. Wonderful food at all of the above mentioned restaurants. Lastly, had a wonderful experience here and will definitely stay here again in a one bedroom suite.''"
"Capitol Theater","Utah","Capitol Theater - Salt Lake City, Utah - Theater, Plays, Ballet, Opera","Salt Lake City's historic Capitol Theater is home to the Utah Opera Company, Ballet West, and the Ririe-Woodbury Dance Company. The theater plays host to world class Broadway productions and education programs for the community arts. Ballet West performs The Nutcracker on Capitol Theater's stage every Christmas and has been doing so for decades. The theater's address is 50 West 200 South in Salt Lake City, Utah. Located in the heart of downtown Salt Lake, the hours of operation for this historic landmark vary dependant on the current production. Inside the building you'll find the d,cor runs heavily to red velvet and gold painted accents. Often this theater is full of fur coats and satin dresses. However as one reviewer said, When Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, and other road-show spectacles come through town, the Capitol Theater is where they camp. Opening nights are an event; though in the way of dress, you'll see everything from furs to jeans.'' Beginning life as the Orpheum Theater, the building was completed in 1913. At the time it was recognized as an, `architectural gem' featuring some of the greatest stars of the stage. Built originally to accommodate vaudeville shows, the Theater has fulfilled its entertainment promise by accommodating silent movies, talking pictures, and musical reviews. Today Capitol Theater is Salt Lake's most prestigious venue for stage productions. In a large part this is due to Utah residents, many who take their theater very seriously. In December 1975, Salt Lake County residents approved an 8.6 million dollar bond to transform the old Orpheum into a performing arts center as part of Utah's Bicentennial Celebration. On October 18, 1978, the Capitol Theater opened its doors to a new era of performing arts in Salt Lake. One online reviewer wrote, It (going to a performance at the Capitol Theater) was truly an unforgettable experience. The building it's self is beautiful. I honestly think every seat in the house has to be a good one. You must see a performance at this theater. We loved it and will return always!'' Another reviewer said, This opulent old theater is a beautiful place to see the ballet, a play or a concert. The acoustics are good-Alison Krauss was wonderful when she played here-and it's the place to see touring productions like Aida and Les Miserables.'' I'd like to include my own recommendation. The Capitol Theater is ingrained in many Utah family traditions. I started taking my children to see the Nutcracker when they were toddlers. As they aged, the Nutcracker was supplemented with occasional forays to see something like Cats, or Les Mis. But no matter what you find on stage at the Capitol Theater, the old world ambience truly enhances the experience. Sitting inside this grand, velvet-coated wonder makes the outing truly memorable and leaves you feeling as if you took a short visit back in time."
"Cathedral Valley","Utah","Cathedral Valley - Capitol Reef National Park, Utah - Scenic Geological Feature","Cathedral Valley is a scenic feature at Capitol Reef National Park eight miles from the town of Torrey in Utah. Highway 24 cuts through the mid-section of the park and is the primary access route. The park is open 24 hours a day throughout the year and is approximately 144 miles from Moab and 230 miles from Salt Lake City. Capitol Reef National Park is a popular place for hikers, campers and climbers to visit, and is characterized by its sandstone formations in areas such as Cathedral Valley as well as cliffs and canyons. Another feature at the park is the 100 mile long bulge in the earth's crust called the Waterpocket Fold. It was designated as a national park in 1971, but has been receiving visitors for more than 100 years, who are keen to see the twisting canyons, massive domes, monoliths and spires of sandstone located here. Cathedral Valley is one of the outstanding features at the park set in the desert area, and it takes its name from the sandstone monoliths that many say resemble cathedrals. The structures here have been given titles such as Temple of the Sun, Temple of the Moon and The Walls of Jericho to name but a few. Visitors will be able to see interesting rock formations all around as they reach the valley, and there are many rock and mineral specimens here but collecting rocks is strictly prohibited inside the park. Visitors can tour the valley by driving along a 60 mile loop beginning at River Ford, which is on Highway 24 about 12 miles east of the National Park's visitor center. The loop follows the Hartnet Road to the Caineville Wash Road and then returns back to Highway 24 just west of Caineville about 19 miles east of the visitor center. There is also another way to the valley via a dirt road that climbs up Thousand Lake Mountain to the west, and another route that extends up to I-70 on the north. Apart from the spectacular scenery and fascinating rock formations, one of the key attractions for visitors to Cathedral Valley is the remoteness of it. People seeking a little solitude will find it here and it could be that visitors may not see another person or vehicle whilst driving along the loop. There is a no fee campground along the Cathedral Valley loop road with six sites each featuring a picnic table, fire grate and pit toilet, but there is no water available here. More details on the valley and the rest of the park can be found at the visitor center just of Highway 24, which is open throughout the year and provides information displays and a slide program. The visitor center is open from 8am to 4.30pm except during the summer when it stays open until 6pm. Maps, brochures and books are available to buy here and there is also a museum with information and displays about the geology, archaeology and history of the area."
"Cedar Breaks National Monument in Utah is a Breathtaking Sight","Utah","Cedar Breaks National Monument in Utah is a Breathtaking Sight","	Stunning Cedar Breaks National Monument is located in southwest Utah near the town of Cedar City. Similar to more-visited Bryce Canyon National Park, Cedar Breaks is a natural amphitheater canyon that rests atop the Colorado Plateau. The amphitheater is more than 2,000 feet deep and spans more than 3 miles. The elevation at the rim is approximately 10,000 feet above sea level. The sedentary rock visible at this monument is natural limestone and the amazing colors are formed by oxidized irons and manganese, creating brilliant hues of red, orange, yellow, and purple. Established as a national monument in 1933, Cedar Breaks is often compared to Bryce and many believe it is even more beautiful, and because it is the less visited of the two parks, those who prefer to avoid crowds will find this a more desirable place to visit. Snow, however, makes it difficult to traverse during the winter months because of its high elevation. The area where Cedar Breaks sits was once home to the peoples of the Southern Paiute Indian tribe. Much of the land later became the property of the Mormon Church and the Paiute population declined largely due to European diseases brought to the area by settlers. The Ranger Cabin and Historic Visitors Center at Cedar Breaks National Monument were built by Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps, a group of young men who, during the Great Depression, were paid to make improvements and additions to many of the nation's National Parks and National Monuments. Both buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. The Visitors Center, though small, still functions as such and is an ideal place to begin a visit to Cedar Breaks. From near the Visitors Center, guests who wish to hike throughout the park can pick up one of several trails suitable for hikers of various levels. The Spectra Point/Ramparts Overlook Trail is a 4-mile round-trip hike along the rim. This moderately strenuous trail takes hikers through bristlecone pine and provides breathtaking views along the way. Those who wish a shorter trail can turn around at the Overlook for a 2-mile round trip journey. For a view of local fauna, the Alpine Pond Nature Trail takes guests through fields of wildflowers and forests of spruce, pine, and aspen to a beautiful spring-fed pond. This 2-mile loop is easy to moderate in difficulty. A more rugged trail can be found just outside the north entrance of the park in the Ashdown Gorge Wilderness area. In addition, the 1-mile Campground Trail is suitable for guests with pets. While hiking can be enjoyed from late spring into summer, the park is ablaze with colors in the fall, making this an optimal time for hiking and photo taking. In the winter, some roads are often impassable and the Cedar Breaks Scenic Drive is usually closed. However, visitors are welcome to enjoy cross country skiing, snow shoeing, and snowmobiling inside the park. Rangers are at a minimum during the winter, so activities are done at one's own risk. There is one campground on site at Cedar Breaks National Monument. Closed from mid-September to mid-June, it offers 28 campsites with no hookups. Reservations in advance are not permitted."

Just came back from staying for two nights at the Chase. The room/hotel was definitely old and must have had some things recently renovated. I liked the kitchenettes, but the beds were ROCK hard, and the bathroom and bathtub unclean. However, great location, friendly staff, but absolutely NO extras included. I recommend spending a little more for a softer bed, and cleanliness.'' This November 2008 online review said, Chase Suite Hotel Salt Lake City is one block from Historic Trolley Square in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. We were here for one night so it worked for us and we had what appeared to be a good discounted rate compared to what is said to be the price here. The two-bedroom suite worked for 5 adults with full kitchen and 2 baths. However this place is dated and tired overall but it was clean. Nice breakfast area with waffles etc. Good location as far as being close to downtown. Would stay again only for a discounted rate. Liked - Lots of room and close to downtown.''"

"Cleveland","Utah","Cleveland - Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Price, UT - Scenic Drives, Native American Sites, National Natural Landmark","Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry has taken more than 12,000 individual bones and one dinosaur egg from this abundant fossil bed. As one of the world's foremost dinosaur fossil sources, bones have been taken from the quarry representing over seventy different animals and eleven species. Cast replicas and original skeletons assembled from these bones are on display in over sixty world-wide museums world-wide. The quarry was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1966. The visitor center was recently enlarged and new exhibits made available for the public. There is a complete Allosaur skeletal reconstruction and a Stegosaur wall mount. At the quarry you can step into a covered building and see bones in the ground while viewing a work in progress. This site is recognized worldwide as the primary source of fossilized bones from the flesh-eating Allosaur. The quarry is open weekends; Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (weather permitting) from early in March until Memorial Day, and daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. The schedule goes back to weekends-only for September and October. Hours are from 10am to 5pm, except on Sundays when the hours are noon to 5pm. To get to the site, take Route 10 south from Price to the Cleveland/Elmo turnoff. Look for the dinosaur signs at road intersections. The quarry is located thirty miles south of Price, Utah, at the end of a graded road. This site is a federal government Fee Demonstration Project sites. There is an entrance fee of $5 per adult. Anyone under 16 gets in free. All funds collected stay at the site and are used for operations and improvements. Scattered throughout the area are room-size boulders which create a unique setting for the exhibit buildings, picnic facilities, and the self-guided Rock Walk Nature Trail. Over the years, many theories have been proposed as to why so many dinosaurs gathered and died in one place. The suggestions have ranged from river or lake deposit to swampy bog, to something involving earthquakes. All have been dismissed by serious scientists. Two-thirds of the bones uncovered at this site are from Allosaurus, the largest carnivore of the Jurassic period. There are plant-eating Stegosaurus, Camarasaurus and Camptosaurus. In the mid 1970's two previously unknown dinosaurs were identified from bones discovered at this quarry. These small carnivores were known as Stokesosaurus clevelandi and Marshosaurus bicentesimus. There is a quarry tour that takes you through a real, working archeological dig, complete with dust and cranes. The Rock Walk Nature Trail winds past many sites and include signs along the way that will help you learn about the history that's been unearthed already, as well as all the history still waiting in the ground. Fodor's Review: Paleontologists and geologists have excavated more than 15,000 dinosaur bones from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, making this predator trap the densest concentration of Jurassic fossils ever found. Since the quarry's discovery by herders in the 1920s, scores of dinosaur remains have been discovered here, including the oldest fossilized egg. Although many of the bones found in the quarry now reside in museums around the world, a trip to the remote landscape surrounding the quarry pit is worth the journey. The Visitor Center, which generates its own electricity from rooftop solar panels, has a reconstructed dinosaur skeleton and exhibits about the quarry, and the area has some short hiking trails. The center is 15 mi on a gravel road from the nearest services, so bring food and water and dress for desert conditions.''"

Our room had a balcony that overlooked a well maintained garden which was visited throughout the day by colorful butterflies and hummingbirds. It was wonderfully relaxing to come here in the evenings after spending the days in the park, and sit on the balcony to watch the cliffs change colors.'' Another reviewer said, When we checked in we did not realize how beautiful the gardens would be. They are so attractive they have made me want to go home and start a flower garden. The pool, spa, room, laundry, and office everything was just perfect and we had not planned to stay there at all. We had a suite so there were two TVs which was wonderful with children. What a jewel. The pictures do not do it justice.''"
"Comb Ridge","Utah","Comb Ridge - Bluff, Utah - Geological formation, primitive camping","A rock formation in the desert and canyon area of southeastern Utah, Comb Ridge is an immense sandstone formation tilted at an angle of about 20 degrees. It is almost one hundred and twenty miles long, about one mile wide, and runs north and south. The first 65 miles are on the Navajo Nation Indian Reservation and to hike anywhere on the reservation you must obtain a permit from the Navajo Nation headquarters, in Window Rock, Arizona. One online reviewer said, We have visited only the northern end of Comb Ridge in Utah. On the eastern side Comb Ridge slopes up gently from Butler Wash. On the western side it drops vertically 800 to over 1,000 feet (245 to 300 m) to Comb Wash. For the entire 30 mile length, it is a slick rock playground and a geology and natural history museum.'' Geologically speaking, the Comb is a monocline. Translated that means it's a single fold in the Earth's crust that was created by a cataclysmic slippage of deeply buried tectonic plates some 65 million years ago. That primeval upheaval left a scar across the desert landscape. This sharp ridge of sandstone stretches unbroken from east of Kayenta, Arizona, to some ten miles west of Blanding, Utah. Both Butler Wash and Comb Wash flow into the San Juan River which cuts through Comb Ridge between Bluff and Mexican Hat. As a warning, this is an extremely primitive area with no water, no facilities, and generally difficult access. Because of this, it there are few people. This online reviewer stated, The scale of the Comb is not colossal: Its ridgeline looms only from 300 to 900 feet above the plains, and shallow washes surround it on either side. But what the crest lacks in height, it makes up in ruggedness. No smooth arkte, the ridge swoops to sharp summits and dips to V-notch cols with relentless regularity. To hike the Comb is to run a gauntlet of up-and-down severities, always at an ankle-wrenching, sideways pitch. There is not a single mile of established trail in the Comb's reach, which is one reason why no humans, to our knowledge, have ever traversed its length. We thought we should be the first. Still, the Comb hike promised us more than an admittedly arbitrary wilderness first. From long before the birth of Christ through the late 13th century, Comb Ridge was home to the Anasazi, or ancestral Puebloans. Its cliffs sheltered the last-ditch, hyper defensive villages the people built just before their mass abandonment of the Four Corners, sometime in the late 1200s - still the greatest of all Anasazi mysteries. For hundreds, even thousands of years before that, the Comb's springs and seeps nourished the ancients, while the back walls of its shady, hidden alcoves served as canvases for the hallucinatory visions of its shamans.'' Each notch in Comb Ridge marks a small canyon accessed from behind the formation. You'll find traces of the Ancient Pueblo Peoples culture along the southern part of the ridge where it follows Chinle Wash. Another online reviewer said about this area, The combs are a very, very awesome sight to behold. We have visited The Combs many, many times since 1998. We can't get enough of them. It is an experience you will NEVER forget, looking at those rock formations standing there like combs. And they go for miles and miles. We have also visited many of the ruins that The Combs so lovingly guard over year after year. Just one of nature's many, many wonders to behold in the Bluff, Utah area.'' Another online reviewer had this to say about mountain biking in this area, This 47-mile loop following roads of packed sediment and loose sand (along with 8 miles of pavement) is technically rather easy and aerobically moderate - if you take the recommended two days to do it. Only the fittest of riders should attempt the ride in one day and with lots of water aboard. Route finding is actually quite easy: Just stay close to Comb Ridge whenever faced with a navigation choice.''"
"Coral Canyon Golf Course","Utah","Coral Canyon Golf Course, Washington, Utah - an Upscale Golf Course Within Sight of Zion National Park and Pine Valley Mountain","Coral Canyon Golf Course is located amid what some refer to as Color Country'' in Southwestern Utah, with views of the springtime blooms of Zion Nation Park in the warm months, and views of the snow-capped peaks of Bryce Canyon in the winter. The course, which as was designed by Keith Foster, offers a number of risk/reward opportunities and challenges throughout its layout. The course features 80 acres of turf, 55 sand bunkers, as well as two lakes and what's been described as a labyrinth of dry washes.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,029 yards from its longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.0 and a slope rating of 137 on Kentucky Bluegrass and Rye fairways and tees, and Bent grass greens. From the forward (Black) men's tees, the course plays much shorter at 5,953 yards. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include No. 6. This is a short par-3, playing to only 122 yards from the Tournament tees. The challenge comes from a rocky tee box where shots must traverse a deep ravine that's littered with 20-foot-tall rock outcroppings, making for one of the most picturesque and unique golf holes to be found. Hole No. 15 plays as the most difficult on the course. This par-4 plays to 488 yards from the longest tips, making distance one of the primary factors in its ranking as the #1-handicap hole. Tee shots should have little difficulty finding a wide fairway, but approach shots must cross over one of the course's dry washes and find a green guarded by a large sand bunker and encroaching natural landscape at the back. Hole No. 17 is a challenging par-3 that plays to 215 yards from the tips. Tee shots must carry a long stretch of natural landscape and find a large and long green that's guarded by grass hollows on the right and three large bunkers on the left. The finishing hole at Coral Canyon looks like a piece of green earth that was dropped into a rugged valley. This par-5 plays to 555 yards from the Tournament tees, and features fairway bunkers where the first and second shots might land. The green is fairly large, but anything that misses to the left will find either a bunker or the rugged natural terrain, as the green complex slopes off in that direction. The course also features a clubhouse that is home to an 895-square-foot golf shop, a full-service restaurant, and some spectacular views of the golf course and lake, as well as Zion National Park and Pine Valley Mountain."

"Dead Horse Point State Park","Utah","Dead Horse Point State Park - Utah - A Utah State Park adjoined with the Canyonlands National Park","The Dead Horse Point State Park is located near Moab in Southern Utah, next to the Canyonlands National Park. One of the major features of this park is its view of canyons and the Colorado River. Due to drop offs with sheer cliffs several thousand feet tall on 6 sides, and only a narrow piece of land connecting the table to the main plateau, the canyon acted as a natural coral for horses. In the 19th century, horse thieves used the canyon to corral horses. The thieves would fence off the narrow opening, which would prevent the horses from escaping. Because of the heat and lack of water, many of the horses kept in this canyon would end up dying, which is how it got its name. When standing on the overlook, you'll view massive canyon erosion that has taken place of the last 150 millions years. It is this erosion caused by the flow of the river that has shaped the cliffs and spires that you see today. The Dead Horse Point Plateau is 6,000 feet above sea level and overlooks the Colorado River 2,000 below. There is little water in the area, so much of the flora and fauna exist in drought like conditions all year around. Most of the animals found in the Dead Horse Point area are nocturnal, and do not come out until the evening hours when the sun is not so hot. The Dead Horse Point State Park is located on Hwy 313 off Hwy 191 and offers year around camping. This park has many modern amenities and features RV, as well as tent sites. Although there are flush toilets and drinking water available, it is recommended that park visitors bring their own supply of water before coming to the park, as water can be severely limited at times. During summer, the days can be very hot, sometimes exceeding 100 degrees, and although the daytime temperatures during the winter can by mild at between 40 - 50 degrees, the nighttime temperatures can get well below freezing. Additional camping in the area includes the BLM Hatch Point-Canyon Rims Park, located on Hwy 191 to Canyon Rims turnoff. This camping area is open seasonally from April 1st though October 30th. Visitors will find more camping at the nearby Canyondlands National Park as well. In addition to camping facilities, the Dead Horse Point State Park also features a picnic area for day use. The area around Dead Horse Point State Park offers opportunities for hiking and wildlife viewing, as well as fishing and rafting at the nearby Colorado River."
"Delicate Arch","Utah","Delicate Arch - Arches National Park, Utah - Geological Feature","Delicate Arch is a feature at Arches National Park, which is five miles north of Moab in Utah along Highway 191. It is approximately four hours from the international airport at Salt Lake City. The Greyhound bus service travels along Interstate 70, making stops at Grand Junction, Colorado and Green River, Utah, whilst commercial van services operate between Moab and Salt Lake City as well as Grand Junction. The park has over 2,000 cataloged natural sandstone arches including the famous Delicate Arch, as well asmany other unusual rock formations. Arches are defined by having an opening measuring at least three feet in any direction caused by the forces of nature, which in Arches National Park has exposed millions of years of geological history. Visitors here can see a landscape of varying colors, landforms and textures that cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. Delicate Arch is the most famous landmark at the park and stands 16 meters tall offering a magnificent picture particularly at sunrise and sunset. It is made from Entrada Sandstone, with the original sandstone fin gradually wearing away through erosion and weathering helping to create the arch shape. Its fame is enhanced by its depiction on Utah license plates and the torch relay for the 2002 Winter Olympic Games passed through the arch. The arch frames the Le Sal Mountains to the southeast offering great photo opportunities and visitors should note they must not climb the arch. There are unguarded cliffs with a drop of at least 100 feet around the arch, but it also offers wonderful views of the southern side of the park. During the summer White throated Swifts nest in the top of the arch. There are several trails to the Delicate Arch with the longest almost a five kilometer round trip starting from Wolfe Ranch parking area. The first half a mile of the trail is a wide track easy to follow but it does have a gradual climb before leveling out towards the top of the rock face. Just before hikers reach Delicate Arch, the trail goes along a rock ledge for about 200 yards and all in all the walk will take between two and three hours. An easier and much shorter walking trail starts at the Delicate Arch Viewpoint parking area and is a less than one hundred meter round trip taking less than 15 minutes. In addition to the short accessible trail, a slightly more strenuous hike climbs less than a kilometer towards Delicate Arch. This ends at the edge of a steep canyon separating the viewpoint from the arch and as with all trails offers great photographic opportunities. The parkis open throughout the year for 24 hours a day and includes a Visitor Center, which only stays closed on Christmas Day. The opening hours of the visitor center are 7.30am to 6.30pm between April and October and 8am to 4.30pm between November and March. Here visitors can find out about tours and programs at the park, and rangers are located throughout the site to provide assistance and answer questions about the amazing landscape and arches."

The room was 700+ sq ft on the second floor, overlooking the river. It had high vaulted ceilings, wood floors, large flat panel TV, large bathroom (even with a bidet) and a balcony to sit on and enjoy the river. It also has a small kitchen area with a small refrigerator, toaster oven, microwave, sink and clean dishes and utensils. It felt more like a condo and was nice to return to after spending all day hiking in Zion. The beds were comfortable with plenty of pillows and nice linens. It also included a small dining table with four chairs and sitting area with a sofa sleeper. There is a laundry facility available to all hotel guests with laundry detergent, softener and dryer sheets available to purchase. The hotel staff was great and very knowledgeable about activities in town, restaurants and hiking in Zion. We checked in late and there was someone available 24 hours and even at the late hour we checked in she was very friendly and helpful providing a lot of information for our stay. It's located close to the park entrance, shopping and restaurants. There was a cafe called Elements across from the hotel registration that serves coffee, drinks and Danishes and sells souvenirs. This was a great morning stop before heading into Zion. There is a free shuttle that runs through town and to the park entrance with a stop right near the front of the hotel. It runs from 7:00 am to 11:00 pm daily.'' Another online reviewer said, My absolute favorite location in the Southwest. The hotel has sparkling clean rooms, nice pool and spa, commanding views of rich red rock, azure blue sky, verdant Dogwood trees, and in December, clean white virgin snow over the Virgin River.

After arriving, we were highly impressed with the room, the pool/spa and the staff. The location is ideal for accessing the restaurants in the small town of Springdale and the stops for the park shuttle are close by. For eating, I would recommend the restaurant on site, the Pizza Noodle Company which is right next door and Wildcat Willies which is directly across the street. All in all this is a great place. The only thing I think would be beneficial for Pioneer Lodge to do would be to give free coffee to its registered guests in the morning. Also free access to the internet would be great too.'' A second reviewer from 2007 said, Recently renovated and it shows. The rooms are spacious, clean, and comfortable. Our room had a decent size fridge and microwave which is very convenient if you are looking to save some $$$ on dining. The only thing preventing me from giving four stars is the fact that the rooms don't have coffee makers, so I have had to shell out about $5 a day for a coffee and a refill. One perk you might not find elsewhere, is that you can use their WiFi in your hotel room; even though it isn't advertised.''"

"Discovery Gateway","Utah","Discovery Gateway - Salt Lake City, Utah - Children's Museum, Hands-on Exhibits","Originally called the Children's Museum, Discovery Gateway provides hands-on creative activities that are entertaining for the whole family. An integral part of the Gateway Mall in downtown Salt Lake City, this facility has four floors of space with over one hundred and forty permanent exhibits. There are rotating exhibits designed for specific times of the year, daily workshops and unique performances geared to providing children a day filled with learning about the arts, humanities, and sciences. Discovery Gateway is a non-profit organization located at 444 West 100 South Salt Lake City, Utah. They are open Monday through Thursday from 10am to 6pm, on Friday and Saturday from 10am to 8pm and on Sunday from 12pm to 6pm. Holiday hours vary, so please call ahead. Children under age 14 must be accompanied by an adult, guests 14 years and older who are not accompanied by a child, must leave a photo ID. Founded in 1978, The Children`s Museum of Utah was developed by a group of dedicated parents, educators, and community leaders who believed that children learn best by doing. After years of honing the dream of a world-class, hands-on learning center for children, the vision is now a reality. An innovative partnership between Junior Achievement of Utah and Salt Lake County allowed the museum to move forward, leaving its worn and tired legacy behind. On September 16, 2006 The Children`s Museum of Utah officially became Discovery Gateway. If you find a negative review for the museum, check the date. Don't confuse Discovery Gateway with its predecessor, as this location doesn't resemble its older self. On the subject of Discovery Gateway's reincarnation, this reviewer says, Don't be misled by old reviews. When this was the Children's Museum it was old, dingy, dirty and overpriced. Now as Discovery Gateway it is bright, clean, and has huge value for the money.'' The museum is geared for kids of all ages. My teenager loves it and one online reviewer noted, My 14-month old son had hours of fun. Even I was sad to leave because there was still so much more to do. They basically have kid-size, mostly wooden-made areas such a house and its furnishings, a farm, a supermarket, a tree house, a boat, a river with colanders and pipes for balls. There is also a giant vacuum structure where kids can put in colorful balls to be sucked in many different ways. Oh and I didn't mention the giant xylophone, a dream come true for my little guy. I am sure all locals have annual memberships, so this review is mostly for visitors like me.'' Another review stated, I thought Discovery Gateway was great! My 2-year-old son was enthralled by everything, and after two hours he definitely wasn't ready to leave even though they were closing. The main floor was the most fun for him while the upper floor seemed geared towards older children although my son still loved it. What a great idea!'' This museum was built with kids in mind. There are no restricted areas, no hands-off policies. Touching is encouraged and playing with the exhibits is a welcome part of the experience."
"Dixie National Forest","Utah","Dixie National Forest - Cedar City, Utah - Forest, Canyon, Hiking, Camping, Biking","Headquartered in Cedar City, Utah - the Dixie National Forest occupies almost two million acres and reaches about one hundred and seventy miles across southern Utah. The Dixie'' is the largest national forest in Utah with over 83,000 acres of wilderness. In this national forest you'll find deep canyons, fascinating rock formations, mountains, lakes and towering ponderosa pines. There are many climatic extremes throughout the forest. Precipitation ranges from ten inches in the lower elevations to more than forty inches per year near Brian Head Peak. Most of the annual precipitation at the higher elevations falls as snow. Thunderstorms are common during July and August and produce heavy rains. In some areas, August is the wettest month of the year. The temperature can vary from summer highs exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit near St. George, and winter lows exceeding -30 degrees Fahrenheit on plateau tops. Forest vegetation goes from sparse, desert-type plants at the lower elevations to stands of low-growing Pinyon pine and juniper dominating the mid-elevations. Aspen and conifers such as pine, spruce, and fir dominate the higher elevations. The Dixie National Forest supports a wide variety of wildlife species that include cougar, bobcat, blue grouse, golden eagle, cottontail rabbit, wild turkey, antelope, and the Utah prairie dog. The archaeological record in this national forest includes pictographs, petrogylphs, dwellings, and artifacts. This historical lore attests to the presence of prehistoric and historic peoples. It is the objective of the heritage program at the Dixie National Forest to help interpret and preserve these irreplaceable sites. Don't touch or remove any artifacts from the forest. Quick information on the Dixie National Forest: From the top of Powell Point you can see for miles into three different states. There are primitive use areas in the forest as well as more developed areas. There is camping, picnicking, resort lodging, sledding, skiing, hunting, gathering forest products, viewing interpretive exhibits, hiking, viewing scenery, driving for pleasure, snowmobiling, biking, horseback riding, canoeing, sailing, swimming, water skiing, and fishing in the forest Big game hunting - Mule deer are harvested in every District, and elk are expanding their range on the Forest. Fishing: in the many lakes, reservoirs, and streams located within the Forest. Game fish in the forest include brook, rainbow, cutthroat, and brown trout. Camping: There are both primitive campsites with no amenities, and developed facilities with drinking water and restrooms. There are twenty-six campgrounds and five picnic sites. There are several group camping and picnic areas available for reservation. Some of the campgrounds are located near lakes and reservoirs. I.E. Panguitch Lake, Navajo Lake, and Enterprise Reservoir, these areas have boating and fishing opportunities available. Winter Sports include cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in many areas. Downhill skiing at Brian Head From a May 2009 review, Red Canyon is located along Scenic Byway 12, just 9 miles west of the entrance road to Bryce Canyon. This is a lovely section of Dixie National Forest, and the red rock hoodoos make some people think they are already in Bryce Canyon National Park. Right along the highway is a very modern visitor center for the national forest, including friendly forest rangers and modern restrooms. They helped me select two hikes in Red Canyon. Arches Trail: This is a somewhat easy 7/10 of a mile loop that passes by over a dozen small arches and quite a few red rock hoodoos. Some sections of the modest trail are steep, and I was glad I happened upon a good walking stick. Be careful with your footing, although I would not describe the trail as dangerous. Pink Ledges Trail: Again, a relatively easy trail with some tenuous footing, but hardly dangerous. The trail is a 1-mile loop starting at the visitors' center. Again, plenty of red rock hoodoos. At age 59 and a minor heart condition - and considering the exertion/elevation factor, I didn't think I was up to the hikes down into and UP OUT OF Bryce Canyon. These two trails were a reasonable substitute for me that involved some reasonable change in elevation and lots of red rock scenery.'' Another reviewer stated, Not as spectacular as Bryce, but you pass through it if you approach Bryce from the West. Very pretty formations.''"

"Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club","Utah","Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club, St. George, Utah - a Johnny Miller Signature Golf Course in the Heart of Southern Utah's Red Rock Country","The Entrada at Snow Canyon Country Club features an 18-hole Johnny Miller Signature Golf Course, which plays through the heart of Southern Utah's red rock country. Entrada is Spanish for entrance,'' and the course sits at the foot of the rugged Navajo and Kayenta sandstone cliffs near the mouth of Snow Canyon, where the landscape has been characterized as both chaotic'' and artful.'' The 18-hole, par-71 course plays to 7,059 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.6 and a slope rating of 131 on Rye grass. Like many of the desert courses found in Southern Utah, the course is set amid the jagged black lava, red sandstone cliffs, rolling dunes, and rugged arroyos of the Utah desert.  But the Entrada course makes use of the land's unique features and contours to set itself apart, with elevation changes in the fairways, a surprising amount of water and well-guarded and undulating greens. As Golf Digest put it, Entrada is a bluff-surrounded wonder,'' and added that the design is as good as it is unique and the quality of the holes is mitigated only by the mind-blowing scenery.'' Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include No. 2, which has been aptly named Double Trouble.'' A part-4, this hole plays to 410 yards from the tips and doglegs right around one water hazard, only to have another appear and run along the left side of a long, narrow green, the back half of which also slopes toward the water. Miller saved some of the most difficult holes on the course for the final three holes, including No. 17 which plays as the #1-handicap hole. This par-4 is named Devil's Hideaway'' and is the last of the Devil's Triangle,'' also known as the lava holes.'' The hole plays to 427 yards from the longest tees and features a dogleg left, and the first challenge is hitting a long, straight drive to find the landing area. From there, approach shots typically play into the prevailing wind to a green guarded by lava rocks and bunkers on either side. Since its opening in 1996, the Entrada course has been ranked as a top destination in the St. George, Utah area for 12 years running. In addition, Golf Digest ranked it among the Top 10 New Upscale Courses in 1997 and rated it the #1 Best Course in the state. Practice facilities at Entrada include a large driving range, as well as practice greens complete with bunkers.

As we were driving in we weren't sure what to expect, as it is tucked back in behind some farmers' fields. We were pleasantly surprised by the camping facilities. We stayed in sites 8 and 9, which were great; it seems you can't miss with any of the sites on the outside of the loop. They were nicely isolated with a nice backdrop of a sandstone cliff. The bathrooms were new and clean. The showers were clean, had plenty of room, and best of all were free. The dishwashing area was a bonus. We loved having access to the Wide Hollow Reservoir, especially in the heat of July. It provided a refreshing dip after some hot hikes we did in the area. We found this was a perfect place to base ourselves to explore the Escalante area - definitely check out the Dry Fork Coyote Gulch hikes! And have lunch at the Kiva Coffee House. The hike at the campground itself was a pleasant little hike.''"

"Fiery Furnace","Utah","Fiery Furnace - Arches National Park, Utah - Geological Feature","Fiery Furnace is a geological feature at Arches National Park, which is five miles north of Moab in Utah along Highway 191. It is approximately four hours from the international airport at Salt Lake City. The Greyhound bus service travels along Interstate 70, making stops at Grand Junction, Colorado and Green River, Utah, whilst commercial van services operate between Moab and Salt Lake City as well as Grand Junction. The park has over 2,000 cataloged natural sandstone arches including the famous Delicate Arch, as well asmany other unusual rock formations. Arches are defined by having an opening measuring at least three feet in any direction caused by the forces of nature, which in Arches National Park has exposed millions of years of geological history. Visitors here can see a landscape of varying colors, landforms and textures that cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. The Fiery Furnace is a mazelike labyrinth of narrow sandstone canyons and is one of the most spectacular places to visit at the park. However, it is difficult to find and therefore it is recommended visitors take on of the guided tours. The Fiery Furnace tours are available twice each day between March and October, and can last up to three hours. These hikes are considered to be quite strenuous so it is recommended visitors take the tour with a ranger first time around and is probably not suitable for children under the age of five and pets are not permitted. Children of all ages must be supervised by an adult at all times and good hiking boots and plenty of water are a must. Hikers will have to walk on irregular and broken sandstone as well as passing along high narrow ledges, so this is perhaps not the ideal tour for someone with a fear of heights. Visitors will also come across narrow places in the rock that they will have to squeeze into and pull themselves up and through. Some of these places will require strength in holding the body off the ground by pushing against the sandstone walls with the hands and feet. These hikes are very popular so visitors may have to book a couple of days in advance and group numbers are restricted. The parkis open throughout the year for 24 hours a day and includes a Visitor Center, which only stays closed on Christmas Day. The opening hours of the visitor center are 7.30am to 6.30pm between April and October and 8am to 4.30pm between November and March. Here visitors can find out about tours and programs at the park and rangers are located throughout the site to provide assistance and answer questions about the amazing landscape and arches. Visitors should note that food, gas, lodging and similar services are not available in the park. Anyone with mobility impairments can access the visitor center and restrooms throughout the park as well as Devils Garden Campground site #37, the Park Avenue Viewpoint and the Delicate Arch Viewpoint."
"Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Dugway, Utah - Wildlife refuge, bird habitat, hunting","Utah","Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge, Dugway, Utah - Wildlife refuge, bird habitat, hunting","Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1959. Covering 17,992 acres with a 10,000 acre marsh system, Fish Springs offers essential habitat for migrating wetland birds. The area was primarily established to provide nesting, wintering and migratory territory in the Pacific Flyway for waterfowl. But the Wildlife Refuge is a crucial resting place for other species of marsh-birds, raptors and passerines, with 277 species being recorded since the Refuge was established. The list of waterfowl and other bird species that live in or visit the refuge is impressive. Both Canada geese and ducks nest in the marsh. Pintails, widgeons, and green-winged teals are predominate migratory species in fall, while gadwalls, redheads, mallards, teals, and pintails are the major nesters. Grebes, herons, egrets, and rails make up the bulk of the water and marsh birds, while refuge rookeries have generous numbers of snowy egrets, white-faced ibis, and black- crowned night herons. Both peregrine falcons and golden eagles feed in the refuge. Great-horned owls and northern harriers both feed and nest. This is just a sample of the birds to be seen. Many species remain to nest and raise their young. Peak spring and fall migrations are generally in mid April and late September. The Refuge offers both wildlife observation and hunting to the general public. The area is a great resource for many universities, government agencies and individuals conducting scientific research. Rarely seen, there are tarantula spiders at Fish Springs. Native fish, the Utah Chub, Least Chub and Speckled Dace are responsible for the name of the area. Many native mammal species reside in or utilize the refuge. Of the forty mammal species seen on the refuge, nineteen are small rodents. Other mammals include mule deer, pronghorn antelope, black-tailed jackrabbits, desert cottontails, and coyotes, the latter subject to population control because they prey heavily on the geese. There is a self-guided tour route open all year. The Refuge office is open from 7am to 4:30pm, Monday to Friday. There is no fee required to visit Fish Springs. It is located in Western Utah on the southern edge of the Great Salt Lake Desert. Take note, this isolated refuge is eighty miles in any direction from the nearest gas station or grocery store. Getting to the wildlife refuge requires a long drive on gravel roads. From Salt Lake, take I-80 West, to exit 99. Go south on UT-36 through Tooele, and turn right on marked Pony Express Route (gravel road) for approximately seventy miles to refuge on right. From Nevada, take I-80 East to exit 410. Then go south on US-93A, turn left on gravel road to Gold Hill, then left in Gold Hill for twenty two miles to Callao, then left for twenty five miles to refuge on left. Hunting is permitted for ducks, geese, coots, and mergansers only. Hunting all other species of wildlife is prohibited. The Refuge may be accessed for hunting from two hours prior to legal shooting time to one and a half hours after sunset (end of shooting hours). Every individual must register at the Refuge contact station upon arrival. Group registration is not allowed. All hunters must sign out prior to leaving the Refuge. If you are hunting multiple days, you must register and sign out every day. Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge Tips: Blinds - Non-permanent blinds may be constructed. Blinds made from materials other than vegetation must be removed when they are no longer in use. Special Blind Area - Blinds for disabled hunters are available. Parking - Parking area provided. Parking allowed on road shoulders in the hunt area. Do not block the road. Closed areas- Are gated or marked by signs. Hunters or dogs may not enter closed areas. To retrieve birds, allow enough room between the closed area boundary and where you hunt to retrieve your bird. Firearms - Rifles and handguns are NOT PERMITTED on the refuge unless they are unloaded and cased or broken down. Shooting upon or across DIKES and ROADS is prohibited. Boating - Use of small boats, canoes, etc., is permitted but gasoline motors or airboats are not allowed. Camping - Overnight parking or camping is not permitted. Campfires are not permitted. Camp stoves and portable heaters may be used. Personnel Property - Decoys, boat, vehicles, and other personal property may not be left on the Refuge overnight. Litter - Shell casings and ammunition boxes are litter. Failure to make a reasonable effort to retrieve litter could result in a citation. Dogs - May be used if kept under close control at all times. Half of the 18,000-acre refuge is mud and alkali flats, with desert upland, the other half is a 9,000-acre marsh fed by five major springs, with several lesser springs and seeps. The mineral-laden and slightly alkaline water maintains a year-round temperature of between 70 and 80 degrees. When water levels are at their highest in the spring, excess water overflows the marsh and disappears into the desert. Despite subzero winter temperatures, the waters never freeze, and the refuge plays host to between 5000 and 6000 wintering waterfowl."

"Future City Creek Center","Utah","Future City Creek Center - Salt Lake City, Utah - A shopping and residential district under construction near Temple Square","The future City Creek Center is a mixed-use development project that will be located in downtown Salt Lake City near Temple Square. The project is being managed by Property Reserve, Inc, which is the commercial real-estate branch of the LDS Church, as well as, Taubman Centers, Inc. The City Creek Center will have both retail, and residential space; in addition the development calls for a green area of streams and foliage lined sidewalks. When finished by the year 2012, the center will encompass a total of 20 acres and be one of several redevelopment projects to be completed in the city. Similar to the Gateway District, the City Creek Center will feature an open air, shopping district. Like many new malls of this type, it is designed to attract pedestrian traffic in an open-air type of environment. The future City Creek Center will feature multilevel sidewalks, as well as 6 acres of green space that will include fountains, and a stream. As this area will be divided by Main Street, there is a skyway planned to link the two blocks together. Transportation to the City Creek Center will be provided by the Trax rail system, in addition there will be large underground parking garages that will provide easy access to the new shopping and residential district. Two major department stores, Nordstrom and Macy's will be located in the center. In addition to these main retail stores, there are likely to be several midsized stores, as well as small and specialty stores. The City Creek Center will also feature several office locations, some of these locations such as the nearby Beneficial Financial Group Tower will be absorbed into the center, while additional office towers will be added to the development. There has been some speculation that this location may also house the Global Exchange Place, which will be the major location that Utahans will do international business. The new building will be used to house government and nonprofit economic development agencies as well as private sector international service providers in a centralized location. The residential sector of the City Creek Center is designed for 300 unites that will include condominiums and apartments that will be housed in five residential towers. One of these towers is expected to be around 35 stories tall. In July of 2008 many of the underground parking garages were complete and construction started on the residential towers and the building that will house the Nordstrom Department Store. Though there has been much controversy about the City Creek Center redevelopment project, the LDS Church and Salt Lake City have received a great deal of backing for taking the initiative to revitalize the downtown area into a center for both culture, and commerce."

During the 2002 Olympic Winter Games, the Gallivan Center was one of the busiest venues in downtown. The center is located in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, at 36 East 200 South. There isn't a lot of parking available. Your best bet is to walk, or take Trax downtown and get off at the Gallivan Trax stop on Main Street to enter the Plaza. Once there, you'll find trees, grass, cement and sculptures throughout the park in a well-organized, comfortable layout. One online reviewer said, This urban park is saving downtown one evening concert at a time.'' Another said, Do yourself a favor and leave your desk at lunchtime-the Gallivan Center is the perfect spot for a mid-day alfresco meal. There are often concerts in the summertime and there are usually vacant benches or tables for sitting. If not, grab a spot on the grass, read a book and enjoy the sunshine.'' The Gallivan Center can be rented by private parties to host family reunions or weddings, you can see a rock concert with five-thousand screaming fans, or play a life size game of chess in the summer. In the winter the ice skating rink is popular with kids of all ages. The owners of The Center are intent on building the sense of community felt by both residents and visitors alike. The Redevelopment Agency of Salt Lake City' s governing mission statement promises that the intent of the center is to, enhance the viability of downtown and the sense of community felt by city residents and visitors.'' These two groups intend to do this by producing and promoting quality artistic, educational, recreational, and entertainment programs and activities.'' You can believe their commitment when you see a summer calendar filled with things like the Lunch Bunch Concert Series, Sundance film screening, Wednesday Rocks, Twilight Concert series, Disney days, Rock n ribs, and a Folk and Bluegrass festival. If you don't want to attend one of their scheduled venues, visit this park to enjoy the variety of unique art on display. Many of the art projects were built as an integral part of The Center with the intent of portraying a natural Utah theme. Adding color and personality to the plaza, all of the art pieces attract local visitors, as well as tourists, to this outstanding Salt Lake City attraction. You will see things like a huge asteroid type sundial, which is meant to bring a bit of Southern Utah's beauty to downtown Salt Lake while demonstrating the movement of nature's time. The Citysearch Website describes The Gallivan Center as, One of those important downtown spots that keep Salt Lake's cultural heart beating strong.

I am so excited for the holidays to come and have everything be decorated and festive!!'' Another online reviewer said, Having lived in major cities worldwide, Salt Lake City has many positives on its side. One major positive is The Gateway District and it's ever expanding development. To the Boyer Company. First, thank you for your vision and addition to this ever expanding metropolis. Your architectural mix of building shapes and there arrangement is very attractive. In fact, I would say much more so than many outdoor malls I have visited, especially with the Union Pacific Depot added to the mix. Also the Olympic fountain is much nicer and more usable than many other fountains. If possible in the future as an update to your expansion plans, could you please fine- tune the exterior finish of some of the buildings. The stucco finish is great as a complement or break in patterns, such as your use of stucco with generous stone accents. However, in certain areas there is definitely too much stucco.''"
"Gilgal Gardens","Utah","Gilgal Gardens - Salt Lake City, Utah - Park, Secret Garden, Stone Carvings","Formerly known as The Secret Garden this unique half-acre city park is filled with twelve original sculptures and over seventy engraved stones. These stones are adorned with quotes from scriptures, poems, and literary texts. This garden was fashioned by Thomas Battersby Child, Jr, with work starting in 1945 and continuing until his death in 1963. After twenty years of additions to the garden, the most eye-catching of the sculptures is a sphinx with the head of Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon religion. There are carved grasshoppers lying beside disembodied heads and a hill strewn with stone body parts. There is even a life-sized statue of Child dressed in brick pants. Located at 749 East 500 South in Salt Lake City, Utah, you will find it in the middle of the block behind houses, a Chuck-A-Rama and a bakery. The park is open from April to September during the hours of 8am to 8pm. From October to March during the hours of 9am to 5pm, weather permitting. It is closed on Christmas, New Years Day, and Thanksgiving. Most Salt Lake City residents have never heard of Gilgal Garden, or the sculptures. Neither did many of Child's neighbors know what was in his backyard in the mid-twentieth century. Child often said that he hoped the garden would inspire viewers to ponder the unsolved mysteries of life and struggle to find their own answers.'' Well aware that many people thought Gilgal Garden was strange, he still hoped they would accept its challenge. You don't have to agree with me,'' he explained. You may think I am a nut, but I hope I have aroused your thinking and curiosity.'' One review site mentions that there were some in Salt Lake City who knew this area as Stoner Park. It was a popular cult'' destination and teens would hop the fence at night to get high amidst the bizarre surroundings. Most had no clue about Gilgal or how it had come into being. Slowly Gilgal's mystique and quiet popularity has grown. The Friends of Gilgal work to spread the word about this eclectic garden. The group banded together in early 2000 to save the garden from being torn apart for a condominium development. As explained by the Gilgal Garden Education page on mediadivide.org, this was accomplished in part because of the garden's significance as the only identified visionary art environment'' in Utah. The site states that worldwide attention is being given to these environments. People without formal artistic training are expressing a personal, moral, or religious conviction - by fabricating monuments from found materials. A few examples of these environments are Watts Towers in Los Angeles, the Orange Show in Houston, or the Palais Ideal in France. These three are becoming well known but others are little known and are in danger of being destroyed. For Gilgal Sculpture Garden, the Friends were able to purchase Gilgal and save it from the bulldozers. They then donated the park to the city. This distinctive garden even made it into the movies. Appearing in Trent Harris' cult movie Plan Ten From Outer Space. Thomas Battersby Child, Jr. named his garden after the fabled gardens near the River Jordan where the Israelites crossed on their way to the Promised Land. Online sites that mention Gilgal Gardens all comment in some form that it is clear that the gardens were one man's passionate expression, even if years of concentrated study have been unable to determine exactly what he was trying to say."

Inspiring the imagination of children and adults, this park is an outdoor playground with numerous rocks and coves. There are unlimited opportunities for exploring. A hike through the area is full of desert beauty and the magnificent goblin forms. The goblins are made of soft sandstone, constantly eroding, and changing their shapes. The movie Galaxy Quest was filmed at Goblin Valley State Park because of its unusual scenery. Goblin Valley is a dry barren desert. There are no trees, and therefore no shade.

The area is ideal for camping, hiking, biking and other outdoor activities. This area is a photographer's dream. There is rock art left by ancient Indians and ruins left by early prospectors, miners, and ranchers in the park. You will also find a couple of great slot canyons for a little more adventurous hike. Little Wild Horse-Bell Canyon loop trailhead is about five miles down a dirt road from Goblin Valley. There is a parking area and outhouse at the trailhead, but no water. This slot canyon is famous in Utah and worth a day hike. Flash flood danger is extreme in slot canyons so avoid this hike if rain threatens.

Goblin Valley State Park statistics: Acres - 3.654 Fees - yes, day and camping Campground - yes, 25 units RV's - yes, campsites have picnic table, paved pad and barbecue grill Paved roads - yes Culinary water - yes Modern restrooms - yes Hot water showers - yes Sanitary dump station - yes August 2009 reviewer said, This unusual depression in the surrounding hills has some of the most unique and unusual formations in the world. What's fun is that you can walk amongst and climb on the otherworldly figures that fill the park. It reminds me a little of the Terracotta Army in China except that it's completely natural. And if the park looks familiar to you, it may be due to the fact that parts of the movie Galaxy Quest were filmed here. Not only can you walk around the strange and grotesquely shaped figures in the park, but you can climb the sides of the valley for a great view both inside and outside the valley. No hiking is required to access Goblin Valley. You can drive right up to the entrance and park in a paved lot. I would plan on half a day to explore Goblin Valley, but you could also enjoy it in one hour or take the entire day to explore and play.'' April 2009 reviewer said, I've been to Goblin Valley 3 times and I always love going back. I recently took my family and we had a blast hiking and playing among the goblins. We hiked almost a whole day with kids aged 7, 4, 2, and 4 months and they were sad to leave. We had to help the 2 year old navigate many of the goblins, but it was a lot of fun for all of us. We plan to go back next year and camp so we can spend more time in the park. As a side note, I've taken my scout group here before and it was the favorite campout of the year!''"
"Golden Spike National Historic Site","Utah","Golden Spike National Historic Site - Brigham City, Utah - Historic site","Golden Spike National Historic Site exists to commemorate May 10, 1869, this is the day the Union and Central Pacific Railroads joined their rails at Promontory Summit. This incredible accomplishment marked the beginning of the United State's first transcontinental railroad. This momentous occasion could have happened weeks if not months sooner. Fierce competition between the companies building the railroad meant they laid two hundred and fifty miles of parallel track. The companies did this in the bid for subsidy bonds and land grants. The government paid twenty square miles of land and issued subsidy bonds worth many thousands of dollars for every mile of track. So there are 250 miles of parallel grades from Echo, Utah to Wells, Nevada. Eventually Congress forced the two companies to reach an agreement on a meeting place. After considerable negotiation they finally decided to meet at the midway point of the parallel grades, which happened to be Promontory Summit. The real'' golden spike isn't at this site; it is located in Palo Alto, California. The spike was commissioned by David Hewes for the Last Spike ceremony. Because the spike was privately owned it went back to California to David Hewes. In 1892, Hewes donated the spike to Stanford University art museum. Golden Spike National Historic Site is thirty two miles west of Brigham City, Utah, by way of Utah Highway 83. Coming from Salt Lake, go northbound on I-15 to exit #365, turn right (west) on Highway 13 to Highway 83. Follow signs to Golden Spike, thirty two miles. The visitor center is open from 9:00am to 5:00pm daily. They are closed New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas. Outside attractions, like the locomotives, are open during daylight hours. There is a bookstore in the visitor center that specializes in information on the Trans-Continental Railroad, Railroading history, and railroad memorabilia. At the Golden Spike Historic site you can see replicas of the original locomotives. Built by O'Connor Engineering of Costa Mesa, California in 1979, these locomotives are one-quarter inch of the actual size, and are fully functional. The original locomotives wore out and weren't worth repairing. In 1903 the No 119 was scrapped for about $1,000, and the Jupiter followed in 1906. There are no passenger coaches at the site, and no train rides available. Visitors tip: Summers are hot and dry with temperatures frequently in the 90s. Winters are cold and can be wet with temperatures into the 30s. Wear layers of clothing, especially in spring and fall. Make sure you have good walking shoes, and mosquito repellent is recommended. May 2009 reviewer said, We got stuck in Salt Lake City when missing a connecting flight and decided to rent a car and visit Golden Spike National Historic Site. We really felt it was well worth the time. The locomotives on site are in great condition and offer some really nice photo ops. We went late in the day and at 4PM they move the 119 Union Pacific Steam Locomotive and at 4:30PM, they move the Jupitar, Central Pacific Locomotive. It is worth a late afternoon visit to catch this part of the site. There is a short video, a small museum and a gift shop that has some nice railroad related gifts and books. Nice stop for any railroad buff. Our 6 year old really enjoyed his time here.'' Another reviewer said, A wonderful visit to a great site of American history. It was thrilling to be at the site where the nation was connected. The location is remote and pristine as it was almost 140 years ago. The visitor center was very informative and the programs were very relevant. The staff were very knowledgeable and you can walk out to the train replica's as well as drive the east and west railroad grades. You feel like you are back in history. A great experience. On the way out we visited the Ogden Rail Road station, which is well worth a visit, with museums and restaurants within.''"
"Goosenecks State Park","Utah","Goosenecks State Park - Blanding, Utah - State Park, geological site, camping","Goosenecks State Park is a dramatic statement of what 300 million years can do to the land. The park has picnic areas, primitive camping, vault toilets and an observation shelter. There is no drinking water available, so make sure and take your own. It might not sound like the park has much to offer, but the view of this amazing and rare geologic formation, known as an entrenched meander, will make up for much of what the park lacks. The view at Goosenecks allows you to look down into the canyon; the bottom is over 1000 feet below the state park. You can observe the San Juan River as it winds and carves its way through the desert in a serpentine course resembling geese necks, hence the name of the park. A deep chasm has been carved through the Pennsylvanian Hermosa Formation by the silt-laden river. The back and forth meandering means that the river flows for more than five miles, yet only progresses one linear mile toward the Colorado River and Lake Powell. This park is located in the southeast corner of Utah near the town of Mexican Hat. Turn off U.S. Hwy 191 onto Utah Hwy 261. You will find Gooseneck State Park at the end of a paved access road, about four miles off Hwy 261. Goosenecks State Park Information: Acres - 10 Elevation - 5,000 feet. Park Open - All Year No drinking water No Fees Picnicking Vault Toilets Stay Limit - 14 Days Total Camping Units - 4 RV Trailer Sites - 4 Maximum RV Length - 30 foot Tent Sites This 2009 Online RV Journal sums up the park nicely by saying, Plenty of space for rigs of all sizes. The road is paved all the way to the park. However, the parking area for RVs is dirt with some rough, rocky areas. Not a big problem, but care is required when parking. At the time of our visit, we made a large loop in the paved visitor parking area so we could hug the right side as we entered the dirt area to avoid some larger rocks and rough terrain. Hook-ups: None . Pure boondocking. Pit toilets only and no dump station. No place to take on water at the park, but you can get water at the gas station in Mexican Hat about seven miles away. Price & Discounts: Free!! Other Factors: A long way from everything, but minimal supplies and gas/diesel is available at Mexican Hat. Spectacular views. Not much to do at this small 10-acre park except enjoy the views and walk the canyon rim. Satellite is certainly no problem. A fantastic place to boondock. Excellent open area for satellite and solar panels. I would caution that the wind could get pretty bad. Goosenecks is about an hour's drive to Monument Valley and a few minutes' drive to the beautiful red rock formations of Valley of the Gods. Also, there are terrific views from the nearby Moki Dugway and Muley Point. Natural Bridges National Monument is also about an hour's driving time. If you like boondocking away from the crowds with spectacular views and easy access to more incredible landscapes, this ain't bad.'' A 2008 reviewer said, Goosenecks is a State Park about 10 miles north of Mexican Hat, if you are anywhere near this area you really should make sure you come and see it. The road to the views is fully paved and you can drive right to the edge. Until the moment you step out of the car you really can't see anything but then suddenly the ground just opens up and you get the most magnificent views of the canyons below snaking back and forth. You can walk around the rim to get some different views and the morning we went there were some people camped out overnight. The views were amazing and the access incredibly easy.''"

The box'' lunch they provided was a large, fresh sandwich with chips, cookie, drink. You pick up these box lunches in the food car whenever you're hungry- or wait till the picnic area the train stops at about 12:20pm. The raft trip was a nice easy float down the river, perfect for young kids. Van trip up to Sundance which includes lift ticket) was fun Sundance Ski lift takes 45 minute round trip- then you have time to explore the resort.'' A June 2009 reviewer said, I don't understand the last review, because many of the complaints are actually things that I like. This is not a luxury cruise. This is a tourist train in Utah. For instance, where is the hurry? You are on the train for fun. It is good it goes slowly. If it went fast, how would you see the scenery, the flora, the fauna? As advertised, the train traverses a single track to Vivian Park and back (16 miles each way), with the engine changing directions. There are also clear signs as of now advertising the six days that they use steam engines. It is diesel on other days. The cars are old (circa 1930, I believe) - that's part of the point. Please don't have too high expectations - this is a small operation, and the trip is enjoyable, and the scenery is nice. My three-year-old really enjoyed being on a train. The service is very friendly, from tickets, to gift shop, to conductor, to snack shop (hot dogs, candy bars, chips, soda, coffee, tea, hot chocolate). What they do, they do well. I do agree, it would be great to have announcements about the scenery and train history. Then again, it is nice to have the quiet for conversation.''"

I visited the hotel within the last month. There for a meeting, I was only in the common areas and found them all clean. But I definitely agree with the comments about the staff at this hotel. One 2009 online reviewer said, I am a huge fan of the Hilton chain because they are consistent between hotels. However, the Salt Lake City Center experience was a dismal one. There were multiple problems - all brought to the attention of staff - that were not taken care of. To begin with, the front staff was not at all up to snuff of the vast majority of other Hilton staffs I have interacted with and I'm sorry to say really soured my experience. This was not an isolated incident with one person having an, 'off day', which I could definitely understand. There seemed to be a mood of non-helpfulness that permeated most if not all of the staff. The problems listed below were all brought to the attention of staff, and I was dismayed that there was little done about the problems.'' Another reviewer said, This has to be the dirtiest hotel in Salt Lake. My company has an account here so I have had to stay here many times. The whole place smells weird first of all. As you walk down the halls there is a distinct cut-rate motel smell. There are also stains, scuffmarks and food trays everywhere. The rooms have really loud air units. There has been hair on my pillowcase etc. Then there is the restaurant. We went for breakfast. The server told us we should get the buffet because it takes forever to get food off the menu.''"

Bryce Canyon National Park has many canyons forming a series of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters on the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah. Through many years of erosion, colorful Claron limestone has been carved into thousands of spires, fins, arches and mazes called hoodoos''. Many visitors come here for sight-seeing, hiking, camping, backpacking, photography, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, bird watching and many other activities. Inspiration Point provides amazing views of the hoodoos and visitors can oversee the main amphitheater and Silent City from three different levels. A purer freshwater limestone in the Claron Formation called The Upper White Member is visible below Inspiration Point, which is quite unusual in that few hoodoos form in this softer rock. The other member contained in the Claron Formation is the lower Pink Member, which is dirtier limestone containing sand, silt and iron giving the rock a reddish color. The slopes at Inspiration Point are quite barren but do have a number of Bristlecone Pines growing on them. Some of these particular pines are very old and feature gnarled trunks, although the younger Bristlecone Pines are tall and thin with pines along the entire length of their branches. Walking along the barren slopes here visitors may stumble across some reptiles such as the Mountain Short-horned Lizard, although these try their best to remain camouflaged. Visitors should note that the cliffs at Inspiration Point are formed of crumbly rock, slippery slopes and sheer drops. As a result this area can be very dangerous so visitors are strongly advised to remain on trails and behind the railings. No trails lead down into the canyon directly from the steep cliffs of Inspiration Point, but the Rim Trail extends south to Bryce Point and north to Sunset Point. Visitors will require a permit for overnight travel in Bryce Canyon's Backcountry, which can be obtained at the Visitor Center located approximately one and a half miles inside the park. Here visitors can view a ten-minute slide program and various exhibits, whilst there are also restrooms and park information at the center, which opens throughout the year apart from Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Opening hours are 8am to 8pm May to September, 8am to 6pm October and April and 8am to 4.30pm November to March. There are two campgrounds at the park with 218 sites available on a first-come, first-served basis and a limit of 6 people, 3 tents, and 2 vehicles per site. Visitors preferring not to camp can try the Bryce Canyon Lodge, which is located in the park and has 114 rooms including suites, motel rooms and cabins."
"International Peace Gardens at Jordan Park-Salt Lake City, Utah-Botanical Gardens, Park, Statues","Utah","International Peace Gardens at Jordan Park-Salt Lake City, Utah-Botanical Gardens, Park, Statues","The Salt Lake City Council of Women established the International Peace Gardens in Jordan Park in 1947. With the intent of honoring the world's cultural diversity and fostering friendship and peace among all countries, the garden plots represent the nations of the world. Providing a good place for a summer picnic or just a relaxing few minutes sitting on a park bench enjoying quiet solitude, the well-tended gardens and shade trees deliver on the promise of peace. The peace gardens include exhibits showcasing peace initiatives around the globe. The gardens winding paths will take you through distinct areas marked by flags, plaques, symbols and statues. Located at about 1000 South and 900 West in Salt Lake City, Utah, you'll find the Peace Gardens along the Jordan River Parkway. The gardens are open May 1st through September 30th from dawn until dusk. Over time, much of the garden architecture at the International Peace Gardens has suffered either from being vandalized, stolen, removed, or just simply old age. Many of the plants from other nations couldn't survive Utah's extreme climate. There has been a movement in the last several years to restore the garden to their original vision and local citizens have banded together to make sure that happens. In its prime, the International Peace Gardens boasted special native plants transplanted from other countries. These included a field of Alpine Edelweiss from Switzerland, magnolia trees from China, thirty types of Swedish lilacs, English unique varieties, thousands of colors of Dutch tulips, and famous Cedars from Lebanon. Today the park is adorned with local varieties of these colorful plants. An ongoing tradition of spelling out the names of other nations in a floral array has continued. There is a flower power program through the Parks and Recreation office where you can volunteer to help acquire and replace new plants. This carries on the tradition of the park as the International Peace Gardens was originally founded as a citizenship project. Meant to be a lesson in peace and understanding between nations, this park is evidence that people from many lands can unite in building a monument to peace. Conceived in 1939 and dedicated in 1952 the International Peace Gardens played a significant role in Utah history. The garden remains under the direction of the Salt Lake Council of Women Past President's Council. Each participating Utah-based nation group is allotted a plot where they are invited to create a garden with native plantings. They can add garden architecture and statues of world peace leaders typical of their homelands and culture. Currently the Peace Gardens represent twenty-six nations."
"Island in the Sky","Utah","Island in the Sky - Canyonlands National Park, Utah - National Park Feature","Island in the Sky is an attraction at Canyonlands National Park, which is located at SW Resource Boulevard in Moab, Utah. It can be reached on US Highway 191 by driving to Utah Highway 313 and then moving 35 kilometers southwest. The Visitor Center is approximately a 40 minute drive from Moab. The Island in the Sky mesa sits on sheer sandstone cliffs rising over 1,000 feet above the surrounding area. Visitors here can see many different views of the amazing landscape at Canyonlands National Park. This is the easiest district at the park to visit in a short period of time with places to stop along the paved scenic drive to take photographs. One of the biggest challenges here is the 100 mile White Rim Road, which provides wonderful views of the area but can take a long time to navigate as well as being quite dangerous in bad weather. However, this is a very popular trail and can take two or three days for a four wheel drive vehicle or three to four days by mountain bike. Permits are required for overnight trips along here and visitors are advised to bring plenty of water with them. Most of the longer hiking trails are considered to be quite strenuous with steep slopes of loose rock and sections of deep sand to negotiate. Taylor Canyon is the longest trail at 20 miles and leads hikers to the Green River, but other trails include Lathrop Canyon, Murphy Loop and Syncline Loop. There are shorter hikes to be taken as well from half a mile to three miles including the Whale Rock Trail, which does have handrails available for the steep climb. Previous visitors to this place have noted the wonderful scenic views especially of the Green River and the Mesa Arch. The Mesa Arch is only about a half mile walk, where the arch is perched on the edge of a cliff and is a wonderful sight at sunrise. Another relatively easy walk is the Grand View Point Trail providing panoramic views from the end of the Island in the Sky mesa. The Visitor Center is open throughout the year from 9am to 4.30pm with some extended hours between March and October. Here visitors will find various exhibits and interesting information about Island in the Sky and the rest of the park along with an orientation video. Bottled water can be purchased at the Visitor Center but is not available anywhere else, so it is important to bring a supply along as well Camping is popular in this area with the Willow Flat Campground open throughout the year on a first-come, first-served basis. There are twelve sites furnished with tables, fire grills and vault toilets but there is no firewood or water available, and the maximum group size is ten people with vehicles limited to two for each group. There are twenty campsites arranged in ten camping areas along the various trails of the White Rim Road, with each one accommodating up to 15 people and three vehicles."
"John Hutchings Museum of Natural History","Utah","John Hutchings Museum of Natural History - Lehi, Utah - Interactive, Museum","Lehi's John Hutchings Museum of Natural History began in 1955 when Mr. Hutchings and his wife Eunice donated their collections of rocks, minerals, fossils, shells, stuffed birds, eggs, Native American artifacts, pioneer items, Wild West guns and memorabilia to the Museum.

There are wonderful specimens of Aragonite crystals and verasite, a rare exquisite green mineral from a single Utah location. There are also many minerals from outside Utah and other natural history exhibits, including birds and their eggs, collected before many became endangered.''"
"Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Copper Mine","Utah","Kennecott's Bingham Canyon Copper Mine - Bingham Canyon, Utah - Mine","Also known as Kennecott Copper, this site is the largest copper mine in the world, and the largest man-made excavation on earth. With a lot of effort over the last one hundred years, the mine is almost three miles across at the top and more than three quarters of a mile deep. In nine years the depth increases about eight hundred feet. This mine is an open pit copper mine utilizing methods invented at the turn of the century. The equipment, however, has grown in size and complexity with every advance in technology. Each of the huge dump trucks you see on the mine roads can carry between 240 and 320 TONS per load. The largest electric shovels at the mine have 56-cubic yard scoop, gathering up to 85 tons of material with each pass. In this day and age, computer models assist in Mine planning and communications systems monitor all truck and shovel operations. Geologists use information they collect to develop complex mine plans that are divided into ore and waste zones. Ore is material that can be mined and processed at a profit. Waste is material that isn't economic to process, but has to be removed to expose the ore. There is a visitor's center at the edge of the mine where you can stand at the overlook and watch the action in the mine. There is a descriptive recording that explains the mine operations in several languages. You will see the 240 and 320 ton capacity trucks deliver copper ore to the in-pit crusher where the material is reduced to the size of soccer balls. Then the ore is loaded onto a five-mile conveyor that carries it to the Copperton Concentrator. Inside the visitor's center you can take part in interactive displays and exhibits. There are even 3-D microscopes to examine rock and mineral samples. You can also view displays showing how copper plays a part in your everyday life. There are old mining artifacts and model trucks and three-dimensional models. The 90-seat theater plays a sixteen minute video describing the history, present day operations, and future of the Bingham Canyon Copper Mine. The physical address of the mine and visitor center is, 12800 South State Route 111, Bingham Canyon, Utah. To get there from Salt Lake City, take I-15 to 126 South and head west towards Bingham Canyon. The Bingham Canyon Mine Visitors Center is open April through October, weather permitting. The hours of operation are from 8am to dusk, seven days a week. Please arrive one hour before dusk to allow time to visit. No reservations are necessary Rio Tinto is the parent company of Kennecott Utah Copper, Kennecott Land Company, Kennecott Exploration and eight supporting functions. They've been in the Salt Lake Valley since 1989 and employ more than 2,400 people in Utah alone. Rio Tinto has operations on every continent and the company's products include aluminum, copper, diamonds, energy products, gold, industrial minerals and iron ore. It is headquartered in the United Kingdom. Mining at the Bingham Canyon Mine began in 1903. This large, open pit mine revolutionized the copper industry. As the second largest copper producer in the United States, this mine provides about thirteen percent of America's copper needs. Every year, Kennecott produces approximately 300,000 tons of copper, along with 500,000 ounces of gold, 4 million ounces of silver, about 30 million pounds of molybdenum, and about 1 million tons of sulfuric acid, a by-product of the smelting process. Kennecott has spent more than $350 million on the cleanup of historic mining waste and $100 million on groundwater cleanup. Interesting facts: -Bingham Canyon Mine has produced more copper than any mine in history - about 18.1 million tons. -You could stack two Sears Towers on top of each other and still not reach the top of the mine. -The mine is so big it can be seen by the space shuttle astronauts as they pass over the United States. -If you stretched out the roads in the open pit mine you'd have 500 miles of roadway - enough to reach from Salt Lake City to Denver."
"Kodachrome Basin State Park","Utah","Kodachrome Basin State Park - Cannonville, Utah - State Park, geological formations, hiking, camping, biking, photography","Massive sandstone chimneys seem to change from gray and white to shades of red with the day's cloud cover and sunlight. Geologists believe that in the past, Kodachrome Basin State Park once had hot springs and geysers like Yellowstone National Park. They think that eventually these springs and geysers filled up with sediment and solidified. Over time, the sandstone surrounding the solidified geysers eroded, leaving the large sand chimneys. There are sixty-seven sand chimneys in the park, ranging from almost seven feet high to over one hundred and seventy feet high. The National Geographic Society named the park for its picture perfect vistas, and everyone agreed with it. There's an infinite variety of photo opportunities of the towering monolithic spires or chimneys. They jut up from the valley floor and protrude from the sandstone rocks surrounding the campground. Activities in the park include hiking, biking, and photography. A concessionaire provides horse rentals, ice, food and camping supplies. Right in the middle of the stone chimneys, scattered juniper and pinon trees you'll find the campground. There are flush toilets, showers, and drinking water, along with an RV dump station...but no RV hookups. To get to Kodachrome Basin from Bryce Canyon National Park, go three miles north to the junction of Utah 63 and Utah 12. Then go east (right) on Utah 12 for about twelve miles to Cannonville.

Make sure you pick up trail information in the park. One online reviewer said, Fans of arches will want to drive the dirt road to the trail head for the half-mile round-trip hike to scenic Shakespeare Arch. This trail also provides views of a large chimney-rock formation. Visit Trail Head Station for Horseback Riding & Stagecoach Rides in the park from April through October. There is wildlife to see in the park, the two most common are Jackrabbits, and chukar partridges. You'll hear the pison jay and might see an occasional coyote or rattlesnake.''

Top Eliminator - This attraction is modeled after a drag race utilizing real dragsters and a special track system. One to four cars can race each other side by side. Each lane is individually timed and the results are displayed after each run for the driver and spectators to see. The Catapult - Provides riders a unique, high adrenaline, vertical experience. When launched, riders experience forces similar to astronauts as they are rocketed from ground level to well over 200 feet in the air. At the highest point, riders become momentarily weightless as they freely rotate forward and backward before they are pulled back to Earth. One online reviewer said, We just got back from a long weekend at Lagoon. We camped at the campground next door. Although the spaces were narrow, they were very long, so you could stagger without being too close to your neighbor. It was grassy, convenient and bathrooms were clean. My kids (6 & 10) had two glorious days at the park. It was Fourth of July weekend, but the lines were never too long and moved quickly. The staff were polite. There was plenty to do to keep everyone busy and happy for two days. I thought it was quite affordable (even the food in the park) compared to many other amusement parks we have visited. Plus, they allow you to bring coolers/food from the outside which no other park I've been to allows. Very nice mini vacation. It's no Disneyland, but it's still a good time.'' This online reviewer said, I'm used to paying at least twice the amount to get in to a park in California, and then waiting in line for twice the amount of time, and on top of that having a full body search to even get into the park... so Lagoon is a wonderful breath of fresh air for me compared to the parks in Cali. I have always enjoyed my trips to Lagoon. They let you take bar-b-que's in the park, for goodness sake! I have always been impressed with how family friendly Lagoon is. It's very clean, safe, and the rides are decent. I'll admit the park isn't quite as flashy as other parks I've been to, but I'd trade that any day for the higher quality food and service and good prices I've experienced at Lagoon.''"

One bonus - in many large cities you must pay for parking, but not at Little America Inn, it is free. I'd stay at any of the Little America Hotels again.'' Another reviewer said, We experienced very good service at Little America, the first room they gave us did not have an adjoining room as we had requested, so they moved us with no problem.

We were amazed by the beautiful view of Zion National Park. The Lodge is cozy, homey and comfortable, with helpful and friendly staff. The beds in our rooms were comfortable and everyone got a good night's sleep. The town shuttle that connects with Zion is conveniently located across the street. The hotel has a small kidney shaped pool and a large, eclectic gift shop with locally made crafts. Overall we loved the hotel. The only drawback to our room was a loud air conditioner but it was not a significant problem. Lodge guests may want to note that the adjoining steakhouse has just changed hands and they seemed to be ironing out some issues with the menu. Although the steak Cerveza entree was terrific at dinner, some of the side dishes were drenched in butter and cream based sauces, and we were told the sauce could not be removed from the vegetables. The breakfast buffet contained stale waffle sticks and was mostly cold. I would have given 5 stars for our experience, except for the steakhouse, breakfast in particular. We would definitely stay again at this hotel, however, due to comfortable and beautiful rooms and the friendly welcoming staff. We would likely choose to eat breakfast elsewhere in the future.''

"Memory Grove Park","Utah","Memory Grove Park - Salt Lake City, Utah - Park, Hiking, Veterans Monuments","Memory Grove Park in Salt Lake City, Utah contains several memorials dedicated to Utah war veterans and the memory of those who died in various battles, from World War I, to the Vietnam War. The striking veteran monuments offer and interesting contrast to the Harbor of Beauty pond. The park features the quiet sounds of City Creek. It is also the center of a series of hiking trails that wind through one of the state's botanical gardens. At the base of City Creek Canyon just outside of Salt Lake, the physical address is 370 North Canyon Road, Salt Lake City, Utah. The memorial building just inside the park is often rented for weddings and other events. There is limited parking available near the entrance gates. The park is open daily from dawn to dusk. This is a dog friendly park with off-leash areas available. From a review site came this suggestion: One of the best ways to explore Salt Lake is to take Trax (Salt Lake's light rail) to the main Crossroads stop in downtown. There is a system of sidewalks and trails that pass Temple Square then follow City Creek along Canyon Drive to Memorial Grove Park. Here you'll find a network of trails (that) cross the park, and then follow the creek up into City Creek Canyon. City Creek Canyon gradually winds its way into the alpine wilderness of the Wasatch Mountains. This is one of my favorite walks as it involves a train ride, and features both urban and mountain terrain.'' Another online traveler gave this description, A runner's delight, with a trail that steadily steepens for a great workout. This is a small but gorgeous park, near the LDS temple and at the base of City Creek Canyon. On a sunny weekend day, the place is wonderful - lots of kids and dogs having a great time. Memory Grove is right in the heart of Salt Lake City, within walking distance (of) downtown malls and attractions.'' An interesting history lesson quoted by one of the park reviewers states that, The first survey/drawing of Salt Lake City valley, was (made) by the great explorer and author, Sir Richard Burton. The picture he drew faces the title page in his book The City of Saints. The picture had to have been made somewhere on the hills above Memory Grove. When Brigham Young asked Burton what he thought of Salt Lake City, Burton quoted `The Rime of Ancient Mariner' by making reference to the Great Salt Lake and the lack of alcoholic beverages, saying, `Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink'.'' Memory Grove's gently curving and undulating paths will also lead to its stone-lined brook or the replica of the Liberty Bell. This park is great for picnics or hikes with your dog. In the winter you can take a horse drawn carriage ride from Temple Square up through City Creek Canyon and into the park. There are bike trails and a Frisbee and play catch area. One tip for this park is to go late at night, after a fresh snowfall or on a full moon to enjoy its otherworldly beauty."
"Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park - Monument Valley, Utah Reservation, Nature Reserve, Geological Formations","Utah","Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park - Monument Valley, Utah Reservation, Nature Reserve, Geological Formations","The Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park has a visitor center, campground, and restaurant. Monument Valley has been the location for over sixteen major movies and scores of commercials. There is a scenic drive in the park that allows easy viewing of the most well known monuments like, the Mittens, Totem Pole, and the Yei Bi Chai. This drive is fourteen miles of graded dirt. The geological formations in the park range from buttes, mesas, and canyons, to free standing rock formations. Monument Valley was created as material eroded from the Rocky Mountains and was deposited and cemented into sandstone. The forces of erosion on the sandstone sculpted the formations in the valley. A geologic uplift caused the surface to bulge and crack. Wind and water then eroded the land, and the cracks deepened and widened into gullies and canyons. Natural forces continue to slowly shape the land. The Navajo people call Monument Valley the Valley of the Rocks. The scenery here is recognized worldwide as the definitive image of the Southwest. The remote location of this park means it is crowd free. This allows visitors a peaceful and unique experience, one that moves at a slower pace than more popular Southwest destinations. Tips for visiting: Navajo Name: Tse'Bii'Ndzisgaii Elevation: 5,564' above sea level, Size: 91,696 acres One of the most photographed points on earth. The park extends into Arizona & Utah. You can view the world-famous panorama of the Mitten buttes and Merrick Butte from the visitor center. Purchase guided tours from Navajo tour operators, for a narrated jeep ride. Places such as Ear of the Wind and other landmarks can only be accessed via guided tours. You can also visit a Hogan, the traditional Navajo dwelling, and travel into areas of the valley not accessible to private autos. During summer months the Haskenneini Restaurant is open at the visitors center. This restaurant specializes in both native Navajo and American cuisines. Also during summer months you'll find a film/snack/souvenir shop. There are year-round restroom facilities. One mile before the center, numerous Navajo vendors sell arts, crafts, native food and souvenirs at roadside stands. Navajo rugs are available for purchase in the valley and throughout the surrounding area. Many traditional weavers raise the sheep and shear, wash, card, and spin the wool themselves. They dye it with methods passed down through generations - with native plants such as wild walnut, lichen, and rabbit brush. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park Visitor Center Hours are seasonal. From May through September, it is open from 6:00am to 8:00pm. March and April it is open from 7:00am to 7:00pm. October through April it is open from 8:00am to 4:00pm. The center is closed on Thanksgiving and Christmas. The scenic drive closes half an hour after the center closes. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park charges an admission. Ages nine and under are free, National Parks and Golden Eagle Passes are not accepted. There is camping available. One June 2009 review said, Monument Valley is one of those places that is worth visiting time and time again. You get different perspectives at different times of day, with stunning views in so many places - from the Visitor Centre, from the valley drive (the North Window is my favorite, and easily missed by those tempted to stop at the jewelry stalls), the views from Gouldings, the views from Highway 163 into Utah - especially the famous view from Milepost 13 that has featured in so many tourist brochures / album covers / DVD covers and Forrest Gump movies. The Navajo are a quiet unassuming people, who will treat you with respect, whether you go on their tours, buy their souvenirs or eat in their restaurants. Don't expect the have a nice day bubbly waitress you might get elsewhere - just a genuine person doing their job. The fact they are still only charging $5 to visit the valley, including the self-drive tour illustrates their approach to showing off their greatest asset. You can also eat in The View restaurant for a pittance with one of the best views in the world.''"
"Moqui Cave","Utah","Moqui Cave - Kanab, Utah - Architectural Building, Historic Site, Museum","The Moqui Cave is a personal museum collected by the Chamberlain family from travels around the world and around the area. A tourist stop since the 1950's, it hosts a collection of Anasazi artifacts, a fluorescent mineral collection and a lot of Kanab area history. The cave depicts the lives and architectural achievements of the Anasazi in Southern Utah during the pueblo period. The natural temperature inside this two-hundred-foot sandstone cave is never over 70?. The cave is located seven miles north of Kanab on Highway 89. The physical address is 4518 N Highway 89, Kanab, Utah. The hours of operation are from 9am to 7pm in Season and from 10am to 4pm Off-Season. The Cave is only open Monday through Saturday. It is closed Sunday. An edited recount of how the Cave came to be states, In 1951 the black and dirty cave had been abused and mistreated and was filled with graffiti and black stains from campfires within the cave. The owner began to clean up the cave by mixing 286 bags of Portland cement in a small fruit sprayer. The couple put a clean white coat of paint over the interior of the entire cave. The paint was followed by 150 truckloads of dirt. The floors slanted badly, so the dirt was used to level the floors and entry. Concrete, 7,000 square feet to be exact, was poured over the dirt to create a smooth floor. This concrete was not delivered in cement trucks, each load had to be hand mixed and pushed in a wheelbarrow to its destination. A stage was built to provide room for an orchestra and the cave was ready. The first use of the cave was for dances and socials. A bar was also set up in the south wing of the cave. Following years of long Friday and Saturday nights, Garth and his wife decided to discontinue the dances and bar and to turn the cave into a museum.'' Today there are museum pieces, replicas of the ruins in the local area and Dinosaur tracks were found and brought to the cave. A fluorescent mineral display was created and has become one of the largest collections in the west. A May 2009 review says, $5 for admission for adults, but I believe it was worth it since it was fascinating to be literally in a cave with nature's cooling temperature. On display are real Indian artifacts, few dinosaur prints, and neat glow in the dark black light rocks. It was interesting at the end to learn about Utah's politics, women, and plural marriage history.'' This September 2008 online review adds, We were driving buy and this unique tourist attraction caught our eye. We stopped in and found the most unusual treat. The cave is large and bright and features fossils, art, and gift shop, lots of dinosaur tracks, a large collection of minerals and many other one-of-kind items. It's a fee of $5 per person to get in, which is well worth it. The owner is very friendly and will share with you the history of the cave (owned by his family since the 1950's). You just won't see anything like this, so I think it's worth a stop.''"
"Muley Point Overlook","Utah","Muley Point Overlook - Mexican Hat, Utah - Panoramic view, primitive camping, scenic drive","Muley Point is a high peninsula that provides vast panoramas high over the desert landscape of northern Arizona and southern Utah. This Overlook allows you to see the sandstone forms of Monument Valley in the distance. Closer in you can view rugged and pristine canyons carved by the San Juan River and its tributaries. The only facility at this location is a vault toilet. There are no designated camping areas, but travelers camp informally near the point. Located at the end of a dirt road five miles west of Hwy 261, the turn-off for Muley Point Overlook is thirteen miles northwest of Mexican Hat and twenty eight miles south of Natural Bridges National Monument. All sources reported that this area is difficult to find. Here is an excerpt from a local review that gives more specific directions to the site: Take UT 261 away from Mexican Hat. It branches northwards off US 163, and has a near-straight ten mile stretch across the valley floor (goes alongside the edge of Valley of the Gods), then the road temporarily deteriorate to a gravel road with steep inclines and 180 degree turns as it ascends 1,200 feet to the top of a high plateau (Cedar Mesa). This area is known as the Moqui Dugway after an old Mormon term for the Anasazi people who once inhabited this region. There are warning signs on this road to discourage vehicles of over 20 feet, but if driven carefully, RVs of 25 feet or over can make the journey easily enough. There are significant views here, but keep going. At the top of the dugway a 5 mile gravel track leads southwest through BLM land to Muley Point overlook, which has more incredible views south over the twisting, entrenched canyons of the San Juan River and the desert beyond.'' Because this location is way off the beaten path, this is a very quiet location. There are several places where you can drive off road and camp right at the edge of the sheer cliffs. This is one of the best (free) camping places in Utah. If you continue to the very end of the road that takes you to Muley Point, you'll run into a deep branch of the San Juan River and be unable to go further. Important note for travelers from another reviewer, From the junction with the gravel track it is about sixty miles north along UT 261 and UT 95 to the upper end of Lake Powell at Hite along White Canyon. This drive passes close to many sites of interest including the Cedar Mesa plateau - crossed by many canyons containing numerous Anasazi ruins, Natural Bridges National Monument, White Canyon and its tributary slot canyons and Dark Canyon. June 2009 reviewer said, Although it's not the easiest road to find, the road to Muley Point is just off to the left after you reach the top of the Mokey Dugway - although if you are heading in the other direction there is a sign you'll see. The road is in far better condition this year (June 2009) than I'd seen it on three previous visits in the past 15 years - although I think it does suffer if there is heavy rain. The view at the end is stunning - down into the Canyon as well as across to the distant Monument Valley. If it's a very windy day you should take extra care - and obviously children and pets need to be under close control with such an exposed drop. The whole trip north from Monument Valley is full of top attractions - the view from Milepost 13, Mexican Hat, Goosenecks SP, Valley of the Gods, Mokey Dugway and finally Muley Point to top it all off (unless you are continuing to the Natural Bridges area, which is a bit of a letdown in contrast).'' A second reviewer said, A great remote viewpoint that few people know. After driving up the Moki Dugway on an exciting steep dirt road, you make a left (but be careful, the Muley Point overlook is not signposted) and after a few minutes you will find a spectacular 360° panorama from the top of the mesa including Monument Valley, Goosenecks of San Juan River, the dirt road crossing the Valley of Gods on the left, and the Glen Canyon NRA on the very right side. Quiet and peaceful as few places can be, it gives an impressing idea of how this landscape between Utah and Arizona can offer beauty, magnificence and variety at the same time.''"
"Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah","Utah","Natural Bridges National Monument in Utah","The Natural Bridges is the preservation of an ancient area that was used in prehistoric times. Archeologists believe that the bridges were first used in the Archaic period in 7000 B.C. The researchers discovered stone tools and rock art that had been left behind by the ancient peoples who once called the Natural Bridges their home. The bridges are located in a small area in the southeast portion of Utah. The area is an unfamiliar and remote territory. The monument is located about 42 miles west of Blanding. Natural Bridges are located 6,500 feet above sea level and occupies 7,600 acres of land. The site pays tributes and protects the best examples of ancient stone architecture in the United States. The highlight of the monument are the three well-kept natural bridges that are located in the midst of two canyons. Each bridge has an ancient Indian name. The first bridge is named Owachomo which means rock mounds and the second bridge is named Sipapu which means the place of emergence. The third bridge is named Kachina which means dancer. All three names are Hopi in origin. The Sipapu bridge has the geological distinction of being the second largest natural bridge in the world. Cliff dwellings that were used by ancient Native Americans are also a main attraction of the monument. The dwellings are believed to have belonged to the Anasazi Indians. The Indians occupied the cliff dwellings anywhere from 2,000 to 700 years ago. The word Anasazi is Navajo in origin and means ancient ones. It takes an estimated two to three hours to make a full exploration of the Natural Bridges. Most visitors enjoy taking a tour of the scenic drive which allows a resting place that overlooks full views of each bridge. A loop trail that is 8.6 miles long was created so that visitors to the monument could also explore the White Canyon while getting an up-close view of the bridges via hiking. A Visitors Center is available on site that is equipped with publications, orientation films, exhibits, postcards, and various publications. At the center, tourists to the monument can learn about the how the monument and archeological sites were discovered and the impact they have on the land and history. The Visitors Center also teaches explorers the proper precautions that should be taken while touring the archeological ruins and natural bridges. The center is open throughout the year. Over a hundred thousand tourists visit the center and monument annually. Fees to enter the monument vary based on whether visitors arrive to the site by foot or vehicle. Individuals who arrive on bike or foot are charged $3 to enter the monument. The fee for vehicles is $6 and each fee is good for seven days of exploration. There are other monuments and attractions in the area such as the Hovenweep, Arches, and Canyonlands. A $25 pass allows tourists to gain access to all the sites and natural attractions in the area."
"Navajo/Queens Garden Loop","Utah","Navajo/Queens Garden Loop - Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah - Hiking Trail","Navajo/Queens Garden Loop is a feature at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and is approximately 156 miles from Moab and 217 miles from Salt Lake City. The park is located about four and a half miles south of the intersection of Highway 12 and Highway 63. It is open to visitors 24 hours a day throughout the year. Bryce Canyon National Park has many canyons forming a series of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters on the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah. Through many years of erosion, colorful Claron limestone has been carved into thousands of spires, fins, arches and mazes called hoodoos''. Many visitors come here for sight-seeing, hiking, camping, backpacking, photography, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, bird watching and many other activities. The Queens Garden Trail is approximately a three kilometer round trip and probably the easiest trail into the canyon from the rim. It begins at Sunrise Point and descends about 98 meters enabling visitors to see many hoodoos that look a little like garden features. It is said that if visitors use their imagination it is possible to see Queen Victoria at the end of a short spur trail overseeing the garden before her. The Navajo Trail is a two kilometer fairly moderate round trip and begins at Sunset Point heading down into the main amphitheater. The Wall Street side of the trail experienced a rock slide in 2006, and had to be closed for a couple of years. The entire Navajo Loop is now open and takes visitors to Two Bridges, Thors Hammer and Wall Street but due to the popularity of the trail, visitors are advised to exercise extreme caution. These two trails can be combined to create a second loop starting at Sunset Point and then taking a hike north along the canyon rim to Sunrise Point. From this point visitors can follow the Queens Garden Trail down to the bottom of the canyon before heading to the Wall Street half of the Navajo Loop and back to Sunset Point. Another way to do this is by walking down Wall Street and up Queens Garden but this is not very safe and therefore not recommended for visitors. Visitors will require a permit for overnight travel in Bryce Canyon's Backcountry, which can be obtained at the Visitor Center located approximately one and a half miles inside the park. Here visitors can view a ten-minute slide program and various exhibits, whilst there are also restrooms and park information at the center, which opens throughout the year apart from Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Opening hours are 8am to 8pm May to September, 8am to 6pm October and April and 8am to 4.30pm November to March. There are two campgrounds at the park with 218 sites available on a first-come, first-served basis and a limit of 6 people, 3 tents, and 2 vehicles per site. Visitors preferring not to camp can try the Bryce Canyon Lodge, which is located in the park and has 114 rooms including suites, motel rooms and cabins."

This company also manages the Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah. One online reviewer said, The Newgate Mall is pretty much your typical mall. There's nothing special about it, at all. There aren't any restaurants so you have to eat at the food court, which ticks me off. They had the average variety of stores the ones I'm remembering now were, American Eagle, Victoria's Secret, Payless, Dillard's, EB Games, Mervyns, a movie theater, Spencers, etc.'' Another reviewer said, What a great idea to have a play area at the mall!

"Newspaper Rock Recreation Site","Utah","Newspaper Rock Recreation Site - Blanding, Utah - Petroglyphs, Easy access","Newspaper Rock is a petroglyph site displaying multiple periods of rock art. Petroglyphs are rock art chiseled and pecked into stone, while pictographs are composed of paint. There are examples from cultures dating from over 1500 years ago, to this century. The older art has been ascribed to the ancient Puebloan people who inhabited this region over two thousand years ago. Lighter in color, the more recent art has been credited to the Ute people who still live in the Four Corners area. This two hundred square foot petroglyph panel has symbols etched in sandstone representing the Fremont, Anasazi, Navajo and Anglo cultures. This is an opportunity to see a great rock art panel without hiking or remote driving. The drawings consist of animals, human figures and many inexplicable symbols. Newspaper Rock is located on Hwy 211. It is twenty five miles before the entrance to the Needles District of Canyonlands National Park and twenty eight miles northwest of Monticello. This Rock is fifty three miles south of Moab. This is one of only a few petroglyph sites that can be easily accessed. The site can be viewed and photographed at close range. Newspaper Rock Recreation Site Information: Entrance Fees- None Elevation - 5,400 feet Open - year round Open - 24 hours a day. Facilities - toilet Parking - Yes RV parking - Yes, including pull through parking for larger vehicles The small campground across the road has a pleasant picnic area. Check with the BLM to make sure the campground is open. There are eight sites interspersed among cottonwoods along the Indian Creek. This campground has vault toilets and non-drinking water only. If it is open it is available on a first-come, first-serve basis and there is no fee. One online reviewer noted, We have visited some of the Indian petroglyphs elsewhere and find this one to be at the top of must see sites. It is loaded with examples of artwork that is clear and easy to view. The contrast of the rock's patina allows for excellent photographs in mid day sunlight. The rock surface measures about 30' long by 20 feet high. A low level railing and fence keep you back about 10 feet. A parking lot is located a few steps from the rock's surface. It is well worth seeing. A second reviewer said, If you are planning a visit to Canyonlands or Arches and are driving from Monument Valley or Mesa Verde, by all means take an hour and stop by Newspaper Rock...It is one of the finest examples of Indian rock art in the US.''"
"Observation Point - Zion National Park, Utah + National Park, Hike, view point","Utah","Observation Point - Zion National Park, Utah + National Park, Hike, view point","From this Observation Point you can see Angels Landing and the West Rim to the right. Cathedral Mountain, Castle Dome and the Three Patriarchs are farther down the canyon but also visible to the right. To the left is the East Rim, including Cable Mountain, Great White Throne, and the Watchman at the far south section of the park. Below, the Virgin River skirts around Angels Landing and the Organ, forming Big Bend. This challenging trail has dizzying drop offs and spectacular scenery. The well maintained path zigzags its way up the steep East Rim Trail, before proceeding through Echo Canyon. This deep gorge is filled with sandstone pockets, small trickles of water dot the landscape. Near the top of the trail, past familiar red Navajo Sandstone, is the white rock known as the Temple Cap formation. There are steep ascents and long switchbacks along this eight mile, round trip trail. The Weeping Rock alcove can be viewed for much of the hike and if you are there after heavy rains you might see several waterfalls. The entrance to several other hikes branch off this trail. For instance, Hidden Canyon Trail intersects the Observation Point Trail. At the one and a half mile mark the canyon trail takes off on its own. Bypass this spur and continue north to reach Observation Point. After several more altitude climbing switchbacks the trail becomes fairly level. A right hand turn would lead into Echo Canyon. Continue past this to reach the point. The quick elevation gain of this trail makes the hike strenuous. Most of the trail is along carved slickrock, or paved pathways. You make this hike in full sun and the steep downhill return can be hard on toes and knees. This hike can be made year round if snow and ice aren't present on the trail. Get an early start in the hot summer months to take advantage of the western exposure and shade in the morning. From Salt Lake City: Travel I-15 south, past Beaver. Exit onto Hwy 20. Then follow US-89 to Mount Carmel Junction. Take U-9 to Zion's east entrance. Observation Point information: Day Hike - Yes Distance - 8 miles round-trip Average Hiking Time - 5 hours round trip Difficulty - Strenuous, this is a long steep climb. Sun Exposure - Full Sun Permits - not needed Trailhead - Weeping Rock parking lot Trailend - Same as trailhead Trail Access - From late March to late October park at the visitor center and ride the shuttle to Weeping Rock trailhead. Otherwise, drive into the canyon and park at the Weeping Rock parking lot. Peak elevation - 6508 feet Hazards - Cliffs at high elevations Water Availability - Unreliable, bring your own water One online reviewer said, I hiked up to observation point the day after doing Angels Landing. Both are very different in their challenges but this one definitely won on the spectacular views stakes. The challenging walk is uphill for around 3.5 miles and flat for around half a mile. It doesn't have the white knuckle chains of the landing so it's easier to take in the views. The variety of the scenery is quite simply stunning. It's a hard walk but before you know it you are actually looking down onto Angels Landing and at the summit you have simply one of the most staggering views in the US to perfectly compliment your feeling of achievement. Definitely do this one!'' Another reviewer gave this advice, The hike to Observation Point provides some of the best views anywhere on the Colorado Plateau and was easily one of my top three favorite hikes which included seven national parks in the southwestern United States. While perhaps not quite as spectacular as hiking the Zion Narrows to Big Springs, this hike is most definitely worth the effort. The trail begins at Weeping Rock in the main canyon of Zion NP. The trail immediately ascends via numerous switchbacks which can easily leave you breathless. However, within a mile you will arrive at the junction with the Hidden Canyon Trail, and the view looking back toward Angels Landing, the Pipe Organ, and the bend of the Virgin River is amazing! Before long the trail levels out and you enter Echo Canyon. Echo Canyon is a popular slot canyon that is particularly beautiful in the early morning light. The trail is actually cut out of the side of Echo Canyon with a sheer sandstone wall to your left and a 20-30 foot drop-off to the right. The trail, however, is rather wide, so those with acrophobia should not have too much difficulty. This, alone, is a terrific destination for those who would like a short hike. Once you exit Echo Canyon you begin to see the towering white cliffs characteristic of the East Rim. Beyond lays a vast high desert wilderness populated by deer, mountain lions, and a variety of other interesting animals. The views continue to get better as you gain more elevation, and you get great side views of the Great White Throne. The trail branches off, the left going to Observation Point; the right is the East Rim Trail continuing on to Deertrap Mountain, Cable Mountain, and other destinations more suitable for a multi-day trip. The trail continues to gain even more elevation, but the views are spectacular. Finally, you reach the canyon rim and can make out where Observation Point is located over 1/2 mile away. As you trace the rim the views into the canyon keep unfolding further, revealing many of the formations you saw while riding on the shuttles. If you are hiking early in the summer or in early spring, wildflowers are abundant in this area. You are continually teased with views of the canyon until you finally reach Observation Point, 4 miles from where you began and 2,200 feet higher.''"
"Old Paria","Utah","Old Paria - Kanab, Utah - Historic Site, Hiking, Camping","Paria Movie Set is located at the bottom of a multi-colored sandstone canyon in the middle of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Designed and built by the movie industry, this movie set was used to film western movies and TV shows from 1963-1991. Several episodes of Gunsmoke, Sergeants Three, and the famous Clint Eastwood film, The Outlaw Josey Wales, were shot here on location. The original movie set was ravaged by nature. Flooding left a twenty-foot gully running through the middle of the three-building town. The buildings were dismantled and rebuilt on more stable ground above the original location by local volunteers and the BLM. You can get to the Paria Set by taking Highway 89 east of Kanab for 35 miles. Turn north on Paria Movie Set Road until you come to a dirt parking lot with a stone monument to the Pahreah Townsite. If you plan on hiking the canyons or camping you will have to get a permit. Check online or in person with the BLM for more information. The BLM Paria Canyon Rangers Station is in Utah, 43 miles east of Kanab on US 89, near milepost twenty-one. Tips for visiting: There is a small primitive campground next to the movie set. It has fire rings, tables and pit toilets. There is no water at the campground or at the site. If you are hiking or camping you will have to bring your own. You can see petroglyphs and campsites in the area showing how Pueblo Indians traveled the Paria River Canyon more than seven hundred years ago. Please do not touch the petroglyphs. Take only pictures and memories from these sites. A strenuous day hike from the Paria Movie set is going up to Starlight Arch- this hike cuts through a thin dry wash or stream (depending on the weather) to the Vermillion Cliffs. Then it's a long climb up to the arch. This hike is suggested for experienced hikers only. Mountain Bikes are permitted only on designated dirt roads. The Kanab Visitor Center staff will help you design rides to fit your time and ability. Off-highway vehicles are permitted within the Monument on designated roads. Cross-country travel is prohibited and OHVs are not permitted on hiking trails. Check at the Kanab Visitor Center or the BLM Ranger's station for maps and information before riding. From a January 2008 review, The old/rebuilt movie set had a fire, it might have been rebuilt though. Even if it wasn't, it is worth your time to stop by and check out the scenery. There will be a sign off highway 89. Most maps show the area too. It is probably about 4 miles or so to get back to the movie set area. Head east out of Kanab, probably around 20 miles or so. You will also enjoy the Vermilion Cliffs as you drive. If the road is muddy and you don't have a 4 wheel drive vehicle, you might want to skip it. It is very attractive scenery and not congested either.''"
"Olympic Cauldron Park","Utah","Olympic Cauldron Park - Salt Lake City, Utah - A 2002 Winter Olympics commemorative plaza, the site of the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the XIX Olympic Winter Games","The Olympic Cauldron Park is located in Salt Lake City, on the campus of the University of Utah, at the south end of Rice-Eccles Stadium. Visitors to Salt Lake can visit this park to view the cauldron that was lit during the duration of the games. The Cauldron originally sat at the south end of the stadium but was moved to its current location in the plaza south of the stadium where it is surrounded by a reflecting pool and cascades. South of the Cauldron are large panels that commemorate each day of the 2002 Winter Games. Today the 2002 Olympic Cauldron is a reminder of the winter games held in the Salt Lake area, and it is still lit on special occasions, such as the opening of the 2006 Winter Olympics. In addition to the cauldron, the park also features the Hoberman Arch, which was the centerpiece of the Olympic Medals Plaza during the 2002 Winter Olympics. During the games, the Hoberman Arch served as the curtain for the stage. This arched curtain would open and behind it was a duplicate cauldron. Today the Hoberman Arch does not open or close, but it is still lit at night with colored lights. Also featured at The Olympic Cauldron Park is a visitor's center that consists of an art gallery, theater, as well as a video viewing area. The art gallery contains a collection of over 50 images from the 2002 Olympics. In the theater, visitors can view a 10-minute multi-screen movie of highlights from the games held in the area. In addition, the visitor's center also offers rental space for private functions such as weddings, birthday parties, or corporate events."
"Paria River Canyon","Utah","Paria River Canyon - Kanab, Utah - Canyon, River, Hiking trails, National Park","Paria River Canyon is colorful, winding corridors of stone, narrow gorges, and a stunning display of seven major geologic formations. The canyon geology includes Moenkopi Formation, Chinle Formation, Moenave Formation, Kayenta Formation, Navajo Sandstone, Temple Cap Sandstone, and Carmel Formation. Paria means, muddy water in the Paiute Indian language. The name is appropriate, as hikers have to wade through the muddy waters of the wild and twisting canyon. One hiker counted approximately three hundred river crossings. Located along the Arizona-Utah border, the BLM Paria Canyon Rangers Station is in Utah, forty-three miles east of Kanab on US 89, near milepost twenty-one. The Arizona Wilderness Act of 1984 established the 112,000-acre Paria Canyon-Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness. Because Paria Canyon runs along the Arizona-Utah border, it is managed by two federal agencies, the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. The BLM manages a variety of uses in the canyon, such as hiking, backpacking, hunting, and livestock grazing. Visitor permits may be restricted at times to protect wilderness resources. There are a number of hiking options in the canyon, including one route that stretches for thirty-eight miles. There are trailheads near the Utah/Arizona border down to Lees Ferry on the Colorado River. Tips for visiting: If you plan to hike, permits may be required to hike or backpack here. Check online or in person with the BLM for more information. Make sure you visit the old Paria movie set and ghost town located just north of the wilderness area. You'll see petroglyphs and campsites that relay how Pueblo Indians traveled the Paria River Canyon more than seven hundred years ago. Please do not touch the petroglyphs. Take only pictures and memories from these sites. Buckskin Gulch is a long slot canyon tributary to Paria Canyon. It is managed as wilderness and regarded as one of the world's best hiking destinations. The Buckskin trailhead is two miles south on a dirt road near an old homestead site called White House Ruins. The Wire Pass trailhead is a few miles further down that same road. There are no developed campsites. This area is home to a wide variety of wildlife. There are several species of birds of prey in the area including the endangered peregrine falcon, red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, and Cooper's hawk. During the winter you can spot bald eagles, while golden eagles can be seen year round. There are swallows, wrens, killdeer, flycatchers, and black-throated sparrows nesting on the canyon's sheer walls or in strips of sand. And tiny birds like black-chinned hummingbirds can be spotted in the early morning hours. Look for great blue herons along the river. Watch for bobcats, foxes, mountain lions, porcupines, and beavers. More common are the coyotes, jackrabbits, cottontails, ground squirrels, bats, kangaroo rats, and other rodents. A variety of lizards and rattlesnakes are found within the canyon. The Paria River is home to several types of suckerfish and the speckled dace. One online reviewer said, Hiked the Paria River for an overnighter in April 2002. The water was quite low due to drought and so travel was not difficult. We passed the Buckskin to camp 12 miles from Whitehouse Trailhead. We would have camped at ten miles except a couple at that campsite made it very clear we were not welcome. The spring at Big Spring campground gushes from the wall on the other side of the river. It was by far the best spring we had seen. This is an issue since I have talked to others who spent hours getting drips of water from walls. We returned the same way the next day. Beware of blisters as you are hiking in water most of the way. The canyon is quite beautiful, particularly the narrows.''"
"Park Avenue Trail","Utah","Park Avenue Trail - Arches National Park, Utah - National Park, hiking trail, geological formations","The Park Avenue Trail is one of the first major stops in Arches National Park. This one way trail descends into a canyon and extends through the Park Avenue area to the Courthouse Towers giving you a preview of Arches' sandstone formations. If you have a shuttle driver, you can begin at one point and be picked up at the other. For round-trip hiking, retrace your steps along the trail rather than walk along the park road. The trail is the closest to the park entrance. There are no arches, but The Park Avenue Trail offers close views of impressive sandstone formations, these impressive formations will remind you of skyscrapers and buildings that shape Manhattan, hence the name 'Park Avenue'. Each route end has a parking area and is next to the park road. This hiking trail is rated an easy to moderate hike because of a steep decent and climb. If you take your time and have plenty of water, a hat, sunscreen and protective clothing, the round trip hike should take about an hour. If you are only doing one way, it will take about half an hour. The entrance to Arches is located 5 miles north of Moab,UTalong Highway 191. The Park Avenue Trail can be accessed from its south or north points. Drive approximately two and a half miles from the main park entrance station and visitor center to the Park Avenue Trailhead (south access) on the left, or three point seven miles to the Courthouse Towers Parking Area (north access) on the right. Park Avenue Information: Starting Point - Park Avenue parking area Ending Point - Courthouse Towers parking area Length - 1 mile (1.6 km) one way Time - 30 to 60 minutes Start - End Elevation - 5,000 feet to 4,680 feet Elevation change - 320 feet (98 meters) Skill Level - Easy to moderate because of the steep decent/climb Pets - not allowed Water - take your own Take sunscreen and consider a hat. From the trailhead you take a steep set of stone stairs to the wide canyon floor. The dirt path is predominantly sandstone throughout the canyon mouth. Once in the canyon there is no trail, but you can only go straight. There are cairns in place to mark the easiest path. A good map will help you identify sites such as The Courthouse Towers, The Tower of Babel, The Three Gossips and The Organ. Allow the time of day and lighting to determine whether to start this hike from the north or south end. This August 2009 reviewer said, The Park Avenue Trail and Viewpoint is near the entrance to the park. The trail is roughly a mile long and takes you through incredible, awe-inspiring formations. It reminds me of the feeling I had when I first visited New York City, looked up and down the streets, and felt so small in the man-made valleys that went on endlessly. What's even greater about this experience, though, is that it's completely natural. Man had no hand in its creation. If you don't want to hike the trail, it's still worth taking a few minutes to stop at the Viewpoint and ponder the greatness of nature and the power of Creation.'' A second online reviewer said, After having registered at the Visitor Centre at the entrance of the park the journey continues on a curvy road. But all of a sudden you will be amazed by the landscape that opens up in front of you. And this is also the first opportunity to get out of the car and do some hiking. This is Park Avenue! There is a hiking trail here that brings you from Park Avenue to Courthouse Towers. It isn't a loop trail, so if you have no one to pick you up at the end of the trail, you have to return back on the same trail. The hike descends steeply into a spectacular canyon and continues down the wash to Courthouse Towers. The total hike is 1 mile / 1,6 kilometers. Around the Park Avenue trail you can see amazing rock formations with romantic names like The Organ and The Thee Gossips.''"

"Peek-a-boo Gulch","Utah","Peek-a-boo Gulch - Escalante, Utah - Geological Formation, Slot Canyon Hike","A short slot canyon in the Dry Fork area of the Grand Staircase-Escalante area, the Peek-a-boo Gulch area is famous for its last one hundred meters. Before the junction with Dry Fork of Coyote Gulch - the ravine cuts deeper into the sandstone. Here you'll find a series of interlinked potholes, extravagant swirls and fins of rock, and several arches. The different openings, together with the many corners and crevices throughout the canyon, account for the name. The hike through this slot canyon isn't long or physically demanding, but requires some navigational and rock-scrambling skill to get through its twists and chutes. The hike is two miles roundtrip, and has a moderate difficulty rating. In order to reach Peek-a-boo Gulch, take Highway 12 and drive twenty-six miles south of the town of Escalante. Turn down the Hole-in-the-Rock Road until you reach Dry Fork Road and head northeast into the desert. The Dry Fork turnoff branches after only a few hundred yards, and visitors need to stay on the left in order to reach the Dry Fork overlook. If you hike to the end of the gulch, the Peek-a-boo route eventually climbs out of the slot canyon and onto higher ground. At this point hikers can turn around and head back the way they came, or they can extend the hike to the south and Spooky Gulch. The Peek-a-boo hike can be combined with hiking Spooky Gulch and turn the hike into a longer loop. The recommended route is to take Peek-a-boo Gulch first, going north up through its depths. After exiting, hiking east for half a mile until you reach the wide streambed above Spooky Gulch. Then follow Spooky back down to Dry Fork, and hike back to the overlook. The total loop route is about three and a half miles long. Peek-a-boo Gulch tips: Dry Fork Turnoff - The entire route from Highway 12 is a rugged washboard road with sand traps and ruts. A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended. Dry Fork Overlook - There is a parking lot at the end of Dry Fork road. It is located next to an overlook that sits three hundred feet above the canyon. From this vantage point, you can see the rock formations that hide Peek-a-boo and Spooky Gulches. Finding Peek-a-boo - A short climb from the overlook takes hikers down a winding path along the slopes and boulders of the cliff, and into the sandy bottom of Dry Fork. Immediately ahead is Peek-a-boo Gulch, heading north. Spooky Gulch is farther down the dry creek bed to the east, and the Dry Fork itself continues west. May 2008 review, After seeing photographs at art shows of Antelope Canyon (with rays of sun creeping through rock walls to the sandy bottom), I wanted to visit a slot canyon. My husband and I were driving on a road trip to Moab, UT and decided to go south into the Escalante National Forest (or wilderness area). We researched a few slot canyons, and found this one called Peek-a-boo Gulch. To reach it, we had to drive about 10 miles (maybe 20) off-road on a moderately maintained dirt road. The area wasn't that easy to find, but it's easily off the main road (we went in June 2007). Then we had to hike down on a trail that was minimally marked (which was fun for exploring). But it's all out in the open so it's hard to get completely lost. Then, we found it! I needed a serious boost from my husband to scale the 9-10 foot vertical rock leading into the canyon... but it was worth it. There were also several other semi-dangerous parts where I was too nervous to climb without help. He had no problem climbing it though. Peek-a-boo was incredible, a real play-place for adventurous adults. I wouldn't recommend bringing children there at all...I think you need to be full-grown or super strong to reach up and pull yourself up rock walls. It's also extremely isolated and can be dangerous. Also, don't go if a storm is coming as it will likely wash out whatever's in the canyon. We had to use our bodies to support ourselves in between walls as we reached for the next climb up (but could always step onto the bottom if necessary to rest). But, by no means am I a super athlete, and since the rock is gritty like sand paper, a good pair of sneakers should help a lot. There were only two times when I felt like if I didn't have my husband there to help, I could have fallen. Nearby, there's another slot canyon called Spooky. If you're claustrophobic at all, do not attempt this one. If you're calm and like a good outdoor adventure, you'll enjoy it. The coolest part is if you have any sense of connection to the Earth, you'll feel the ghost of the water rushing through as you navigate yourself through winding channels and swirling empty pools.''"

Bryce Canyon National Park has many canyons forming a series of horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters on the edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau in southern Utah. Through many years of erosion, colorful Claron limestone has been carved into thousands of spires, fins, arches and mazes called hoodoos''. Many visitors come here for sight-seeing, hiking, camping, backpacking, photography, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, bird watching and many other activities. The Peek-A-Boo Loop Trail is a nine kilometer round trip offering wonderful views across the landscape of the many rock formations, as well as being a spectacular hike through the heart of Bryce Amphitheater. This steep trail is very strenuous and begins at Bryce Point before dropping quickly to the canyon floor, where hikers are advised to be very careful because of the change in elevations as well as the horse and mule riders that can be encountered near the bottom of the trail. Strenuous hikes are generally those consisting of steep grades with multiple elevation changes and are not recommended for visitors with low fitness levels or a fear of heights. Staff at the park always recommend that visitors take plenty of water on this trail as well as others, especially during the summer months. Near the bottom of the trail there are restroom facilities, which are also shared with the trail rides. More experienced hikers may like to combine some of the hikes to make them more of a challenge such as pairing the Navajo and Peek-A-Boo or Navajo/ Queens Garden combo with the Peek-A-Boo trail. Visitors will require a permit for overnight travel in Bryce Canyon's Backcountry, which can be obtained at the Visitor Center located approximately one and a half miles inside the park. Here visitors can view a ten-minute slide program and various exhibits, whilst there are also restrooms and park information at the center, which opens throughout the year apart from Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day.

Visitors are not allowed to take pets on this trail or indeed any of the park's trails or viewpoints, but they can be walked along the roads, in campgrounds and parking lots as long as they are kept on a leash. There are two campgrounds at the park with 218 sites available on a first-come, first-served basis and a limit of 6 people, 3 tents, and 2 vehicles per site. Visitors preferring not to camp can try the Bryce Canyon Lodge, which is located in the park and has 114 rooms including suites, motel rooms and cabins."

Fishing is particularly popular here with different varieties of sport fish in the water such as trophy-sized tiger muskie, which is a hybrid fish combining the muskie with a pike. These fish can grow quite large and the record sized catch for Utah was caught in Pineview Reservoir coming in at 49 inches long and weighing 33lbs and 9oz. The Ogden River, below the reservoir, and the South Fork, above the reservoir also offer very good trout fishing with the latter a popular fly fishing stream as well. The mountains surrounding the water makes the reservoir ideal for water skiing and wake boarding as the water is usually quite still due to minimal wind. Cemetry Point is a popular place for visitors with its picnic tables and paved parking, whilst there are also nice sandy beaches by the water and boating is made easier with paved launch ramps.

With a motocross track designed by Jeremy McGrath, the mountain is transformed for a week in late August into a MX race course and summer music festival. With camping, hiking, biking, food, live music and a lot more activities, the Powder Mountain Motocross is a big event. On February 2009 reviewer said, This is an amazing mountain. I hate resorts and this is about as far from one as you can get. Its far off the beaten path, so even 2 days after a big storm there are plenty of great lines though the Aspen tree groves and a monstrous Powder Country that they run a bus down to a pick-up point about 3 miles down the road. The Snow Cat will bring you to the top of Lightning Ridge, which is where I had the ride of my life. The terrain is fantastic for all skill levels. Everyone can find something that will suit them at Powder Mountain. With a small snack bar that serves as the bar as well, there isn't much as far as chow goes, but who cares when you have a mountain of this size. Being out in the middle of nowhere, there are less bratty kids running around unsupervised, which is always good.'' An April 2009 reviewer said, Pow Wow is a great resort to just get away from all the crowds and waiting in line. Their lifts may be a little slower than most resorts (besides hidden lake) but I'd much rather be sitting on the lift than standing in line, better view. If you're looking for rails, they have plenty of them. Their nighthill is great, even in the day I believe they have some of the steepest groomed runs on the nighthill, which ya can fly down at amazing speeds with a mini terrain park with rails and kickers on the night hill as well. It is a wide and diverse mountain with lots of fun stuff to do. They use no snow making equipment. I went like 20 times this year, plan on getting a season pass next year for sure. They have a spring session snowboard and ski comp in the spring too which is fun to checkout. I'd say their backcountry is about as fun as it gets, but that's just what I enjoy more, there is fun for all types of riders at Pow Wow. Probably not the best resort to go alone if you're still just learning. Lots of places to get lost, but if you read signs and know where u are on the mountain at all times then you should be fine, but you can never be too careful were all human and can make a mistake, making a wrong turn. So don't do unfamiliar terrain alone.''"
"Promontory","Utah","Promontory - the Ranch Club, Dye Canyon Course, Park City, Utah - A Pete Dye Mountain Golf Course That's Big on Views and Yardage, But Designed for Family Play","Pete Dye has a reputation for designing some of the most challenging golf courses in the world. Some have even been called diabolical.'' And, at first glance, the Dye Canyon Course at Promontory - the Ranch Club might seem to fit that label, but Dye claims he designed the Canyon course to play receptive golf'' and called the course very playable.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2002, plays to a whopping 7,696 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 75.6. But, because of the high mountain elevations - from 6,000 to 7,100 feet above sea level - and the elevation changes on the course, it's been said that you can throw out the yardage book'' when playing the Canyon course. The course plays through rolling hills and features some spectacular canyon views, giving players the feeling that they're standing atop a mountain looking down for miles. In describing the land and the course, designer Dye had this to say: When I walked Promontory for the first time, I was amazed at how well the land lends itself to golf. With rambling sage brush and meadows on the front nine and beautiful canyons at the turn, I have created a great golf experience everyone will enjoy.'' The course has also been described as well-defined,'' the fairways well-manicured and the greens so large they should be measured in acres rather than square footage. The green complexes are also particularly stunning on this course, often with a lot of movement from surrounding canyon walls, crests and sloping aprons stocked with bunkers. The front nine holes play along a hillside and offer panoramic views of Park City, Deer Valley, the Wasatch Range, and the Olympic Sports Park in the distance. The back nine plays through scenic mountain canyons and meadows at the highest elevations of Promontory. The holes tend to play somewhat tighter on the back nine, but the canyon walls tend to redirect errant shots back toward the fairways. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 3, which plays to an unheard-of 720 yards from the back tees. The hole plays downhill, however, dropping 80 feet from tee to fairway, and another 54 feet to the green, while playing through an arroyo that narrows considerably near the green. On the back nine, Hole No. 15 is a par-4 that plays to 447 yards from the tips. This hole features a bit of target golf, with tee shots playing over the natural terrain to a fairway that's 77 feet below the tee. A total of 11 bunkers guard this hole, including four around the green. Since its opening, the Dye Canyon Course has receive many accolades, including from Dye himself, who predicted the course would eventually be ranked in the Top 10 in the country. Golf Inc. Magazine named it the 2003 Golf Development of the Year, and Estates West Magazine said Altogether, it's a stunning and memorable course.'' Practice facilities include a driving range and short-game practice area. The Dye Canyon Course Clubhouse is one of five clubhouses at Promontory, and features a golf pro shop, locker rooms, private lounges, and the Hearth restaurant."

Zion. The small building had no elevator, but we were happy to see a fridge and microwave. There was a large counter in the bathroom and a nice mountain view. It was a short walk to the free shuttle that took us to Mt. Zion. We did one trail too many and were exhausted when we got back, so we didn't get to explore the local restaurants. My husband picked up an overpriced pizza and we ate in. This park also provided RV campsites. It was comfortable and in a good location. Another online reviewer said, Quality Inn definitely lives up to its name. The staff was friendly, and Zion Park was BEYOO-Tiful. Our room smelled wonderful, like fresh vanilla and cinnamon. The lotions they provided were soothing and our view of the mountains were beautiful. In our view also there was a little vegetable garden (so cute!) A garden with high towering mountains in the backyard. The pool is a little cold (but I guess it's seasonal) Breakfast is your normal breakfast: coffee, hot choco, cereal, eggs, bacon. But it was so CLEAN!''"

The hotel is a pretty good location for SLC depending upon what you want to do - close to Temple Square, shopping, and if there were an event going on at convention center or arena, it would be really handy (and then I'm sure you wouldn't be able to name such a low price). I did rent a car - and glad I did - but the parking here is pretty expensive. My room was very nice size and adequately furnished. The bed was comfortable. Nice desk and no issues with Internet access. I did have a lack of hot water 1 night, but not others. Carpet was really, really badly stained - wow. For 3 out of 4 nights I had no noise problems at all. The last night, new guests on the floor made me realize that the soundproofing (door and walls) isn't as good as I'd like. So, basically I thought the property was decent, average, nothing special, but for the price I paid, it was very good value and prompted me to give it a higher rating than if I paid rack rate.'' From March, 2009 review, This is a tough review to write. It's tough because there is really nothing to say. This hotel is nothing just average, average, average. It's not bad, it's not great. It's one of those hotels that you can easily forget a week later. If you have ever stayed at a couple decade old downtown boxy business-type hotel, you have already stayed here!! The rest of the reviews below mine, do a good job of summing everything up. Just don't expect any charm. Oh, but if you like the Sleep Number beds, they do offer those!''"

A proper pitch and great action. Real's new Stadium was still under construction when I attended a game, but it's a totally different experience than Rice Eccles. No more football yardage lines and artificial turf. Not to mention that you can finally get a beer. The games are family friendly and it's a great way to bring the community together. I am planning to attend a few more games this year. The food is pretty good. I would recommend the BBQ sandwich. It's a little messy and I just about dumped it on the person in from of me when Findley scored an amazing goal. Great start, but its time to get a few more choices of beer. Give us the local beer we crave.'' An August 2009 reviewer said, Great looking stadium, love everything about it!''"

Allow one and a half hours to complete the loop to the start of the Zion Narrows and back to the Riverside Walk trailhead. The best season to hike this trail is from March to October. The trail closes sometimes in the winter due to icy conditions. From early April to early November you can park at the Zion Canyon Visitors Center and ride the Zion Canyon Shuttle. The rest of the year drive into Zion Canyon and park at the very last stop at the end of the road. This is one of the most popular trails in the park. This paved trail is well maintained making it accessible to strollers and wheel chairs. Riverside Walk information: Day Hike - Yes Trail Distance - 2 miles round trip Average Hiking Time - 1.5 hour round trip Trail Distance - 2 miles round trip Average Hiking Time - 1.5 hour round trip Accessible Trail - Yes Trail Usage - Heavy Difficulty - Easy Sun Exposure - Shaded along most of the path. Permits - Not required. Trailhead - Temple of Sinawava Trailend - Same as trailhead Elevation Gain - 57' Restrooms - Available at the Temple of Sinawava Water Availability - At trailhead, water bottles can be filled at the drinking fountain Difficulty - Easy This trails best features include the towering monoliths and the pools and small rapids of the Virgin River. The shade and water along this hike provide a cool environment where many visitors stop and soak their feet in the river. This online reviewer in 0ctober 2008 said, We walked along the Riverside trail after coming down from the Angel's Landing Trail. We hiked the trail in the fall and the trail was refreshingly cool after the baking heat of Angel's Landing. The trail provided a different beauty and we could look up in the Canyon instead of down from Angel's Landing. We were surprised by a small group of deer munching away in the grass, and the hanging gardens provided another beauty of their own. No trip to Zion should be considered complete without a walk along Riverside.'' A second reviewer said, This is a great walk in the park. It is located at the last bus stop along the route. It's flat and paved so anyone can do it. It is very beautiful walking along the bottom of the canyon next to the river with the red canyon walls towering around you. At several points along the walk and at the end you are able to walk down to the river. Make sure to bring a towel if you want to get your feet wet. Overall, I think this is a must for anyone who is visiting the park. Just make sure to bring the camera!''"
"Salt Lake City International Airport - Salt Lake City UT Salt Lake City Airport Flights","Utah","Salt Lake City International Airport - Salt Lake City UT Salt Lake City Airport Flights","Those who value punctuality will want to be sure to schedule a flight through Salt Lake City International Airport. The airport ranks first in the nation for on-time arrivals and departures. It also has the fewest cancelled flights on any airport in the country. Serving as the only major airport in its region, the airport authorities have opted to be as efficient as possible. More than 20 million passengers fly through the airport each year. Although routes are added and changed, passenger numbers have remained fairly constant. Delta is the largest carrier, and so the city will be greatly affected by the Northwest - Delta merger. At first, the main outcome seems to be the launch of a number of new Asian destinations, taking advantage of Northwest's connections. However, with Delta hosting or code-sharing 70% of the flights at Salt Lake City, other effects are sure to be felt here first. In additional to Delta, Southwest also serves Salt Lake City International Airport. It is the main low-cost carrier there. Salt Lake also offers extensive services to private travelers, and the Great Salt Lake has been used to sea plane landings in the past. The airport consists of two main terminals with five concourses and 90 gates. There are four runways, all running in the same direction. There is no cross winds runway as the winds are as consistent and efficient as the rest of the airport operations. The fiscally minded will be interested to know that in this era of economic uncertainty, the Salt Lake airport is truly unique. It is the only airport in the country that is debt free. The airport paid off all of its debt in 2008. While the airport authorities have (naturally) been looking at spending some money on expansions and upgrades, the airport currently doesn't have anything planned other than being debt free."

My room was clean. The staff was nice, both to me and to each other. The only noise was from my neighbor, whose television and phone conversation I could hear in the evening. The location is superb. My room (unit 814) commanded a magnificent northern view of the Wasatch foothills, of the mountains to the west beyond the Great Salt Lake, of the LDS conference center in the middle distance and of the state capitol building behind it and above it. The bed was comfortable and clean, the room lavishly appointed. The staff in the lobby were happy to help in any way within their power. The location is ideal. And the failure of windows to open might be widespread in Salt Lake City. For instance, a sixties-style road motel just two blocks from the Plaza (City Creek Inn) does not allow its guests to open their windows either. (I visited City Creek Inn during this stay in SLC and they permitted me to view one of their rooms.) What most impressed me about Salt Lake Plaza Hotel was a small interaction in the lobby. As I was checking out, I noticed the maintenance man nearby and thanked him for showing me how to turn on the lamp two days earlier. Another staffer overheard this, handed me a comment card, and suggested that I write a commendation for the maintenance man. This small example of thoughtfulness indicates that the staff is kind to each other, which is a good sign.'' A June 2009 online reviewer said, We stayed at the Plaza for one night. All in all, it was acceptable. The service was quite good. The room was clean. Pretty much what I expected for the money (which was very reasonable). The location is great; I'm sure you can't beat it for the price. I would suggest that you avoid the restaurant. It was overpriced and really not good, though the staff was nice. It was difficult to get parking, due to events in the area, but we managed. We would stay here again.''"
"Salt Lake Tabernacle","Utah","Salt Lake Tabernacle - Salt Lake City, Utah - Concert Hall and home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir","The Salt Lake Tabernacle is located at Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City. The building is also known as the Mormon Tabernacle, and was originally built to house church meetings and the LDS Church's semi annual General Conference. The building that houses the Salt Lake Tabernacle was built between 1864 and 1867 and was the home of church meetings and the General Conference for 132 years, until the meetings were moved to a new building in 2000. The tabernacle is built on a sandstone foundation, with a dome that is supported by forty-four sandstone piers. The seating capacity of the tabernacle is 8,000. One of the main focal points of the tabernacle's interior is the pipe organ, which has 11,623 pipes, and is one of the largest pipe organs in the world. The acoustic sounds of this building was one of the main focal points in its construction, as there were no electronics to help amplify sound when it was constructed. Today, the Salt Lake Tabernacle is the home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and at one time also housed the Utah Symphony Orchestra. The Mormon Tabernacle Choir performs throughout the year at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, with many of the events open to the public. Some of these events include the Orchestra on Temple Square Concert held during the spring, and the Annual Christmas Concert, as well as several public rehearsal concerts that are held throughout the year. Also open to the public is the weekly broadcasts The Music and the Spoken Word and guests are welcome. There is no charge for admittance to the Salt Lake Tabernacle."
"Salt Lake Temple","Utah","Salt Lake Temple - Utah - The largest temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints","The Salt Lake Temple is the largest, as well as the most known temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints, also known as Mormons. Four days after the Mormon Pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, on July 28, 1847 Brigham Young marked the spot where the temple would be built, but the site would not actually be dedicated until February 14, 1853, and the groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 6, 1853. Work on the Salt Lake Temple was temporarily halted during the Utah War, but was resumed in 1858. Construction on the temple would not be finished for 40 years, but on April 6, 1893 the presiding LDS President finally dedicated the temple. The Salt Lake Temple is located in the middle of Temple Square, in the downtown area of Salt Lake City, at 50 West North Temple St. The interior of the temple is not open to the public, as it is considered a sacred place by the Latter Day Saints. To gain access to the interior of the Salt Lake Temple it is necessary to get a bishop's recommend, which are only given to church members in good standing. Although the temple itself is not accessible to the public, the outside temple grounds are, and the area known, as Temple Square has become a major tourist attraction over the years, drawing from 3 to 5 million tourists annually. The President and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the LDS Church use the temple for their weekly meetings; therefore there are special meeting rooms in the temple set aside for this purpose. The Salt Lake Temple has a distinct 6 spire gothic design and is a total of 253,015 sq ft; on top of the temple is a golden statue of the Angel Moroni, which is 12.5 feet tall. The Temple Square area consists of 10 acres and includes additional LDS buildings, as well as gardens where concerts and other events are often hosted. During the Holiday Season, the gardens of Temple Square are lit up with hundreds of thousands of lights. For those LDS members who are visiting the temple with a bishop's recommend, the temple hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Sunday best dress is required. Clothing rental is available at this temple if needed; in addition there is also a cafeteria. The temple visitor's center is located in Temple Square. The Salt Lake Temple is closed for all major holidays, as well as closing occasionally for maintenance."
"Salt Palace Convention Center-Salt Lake City","Utah","Salt Palace Convention Center-Salt Lake City, Utah-Convention Center, Exhibit Space","The Salt Palace Convention Center is located in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The ideal place for meetings of any size or occasion, the Salt Palace has over 500,000 square feet of exhibit space. Of this, 365,000 square feet of the space can be continuous exhibit space. The space can be partitioned with flexible walls into one to eight separate halls. This allows for more than one exhibitor at the same time. Besides exhibition space, the Salt Palace has a 45,000 square foot ballroom. One of the largest in the western part of the United States, if you don't need that much space, it can be broken down into ten separate sections. The interior dycor of the Salt Palace is punctuated by the five-story main concourse. The snowflake chandeliers and custom designed, cottonwood-patterned carpet compliment the intended theme. Part architectural showpiece and part modern art sculpture, the Salt Palace can't be overlooked. Open during specified times for booked events, the Salt Palace Convention Center is located in the center of Salt Lake City on 100 S. West Temple. The Salt Palace started life as the home to the Jazz basketball team and the largest concert venue in the state. When the Energy Solutions Center was built, the Salt Palace was redesigned as a convention center. An online review of the Salt Palace said, This place is BIG. But for some reason it's really easy to navigate. I never got lost even though it felt like this place was going to be a challenge. The ceilings are mighty high. High enough for Olympic trampolinists (yeah they were actually there). All of the rooms feel equally expansive and large. The grand ballroom has a pretty decorative ceiling too. Near the stairwell there are columns, arches, and window lighting that makes this place feel really grand. I was always impressed when coming into this section.'' Another reviewer said, How could I not be excited to go to a place called the Salt Palace?! The convention center is huuuge. The building is very nice, lots of natural light comes in through many skylights. A neat wind chime exhibit is featured in the main entrance, be sure to check that out. The center staff was very organized & efficient as they served a plated lunch to over 1,000. The food was standard convention fare, nothing spectacular. But, again, the staff was superb at handling guests' special requests, veggie meals, etc. One of the downsides of the place is that there are no posted maps anywhere, so you sometimes need to wander around a bit to figure out where you're going. If you're an event planner, be sure to include a map for your attendees! The facility is huge & has very high ceilings and like most convention sites, can be over-air-conditioned. Bring a sweater. The sweater will also come in handy if you have any sessions on the 2nd floor where the chairs are quite uncomfortable; they've got a metal bar that stretches right across the back so the sweater is perfect to pad it. I'll end on a positive note : There are recycle bins for containers stationed around the building. Love it! BOTTOM LINE: A good spot to hold large affairs. Within walking distance to sights, restaurants, & numerous hotels. A nice staff adds to the pleasure of being in the Salt Palace.''"
"Sand Dune Arch","Utah","Sand Dune Arch - Arches National Park, Utah - Geological formation, hiking","Sand Dune Arch is named for its location in a sandy slot canyon between two fins. The sand here is particularly fine and pinkish-red in color. The main trail, which also gives access to Broken Arch and Tapestry Arch, drops gently for .1 miles through desert sage and blackbrush to a spur for Sand Dune Arch. Turn right and follow the sandy path through a narrow slot that opens into a pleasantly shaded clearing. Then continue in the slot to Sand Dune Arch. It will be on the right. If you have children, this is one stop within Arches you won't want to miss. The deep, pink sand provides the perfect place to build sandcastles and dig your toes in to the soft, fine sand. The tall fins in the area create shade and cooler temperatures, making this a good spot for families to spend time on visits in peak summer months. If you are curious, the slot continues for a short distance beyond the arch but becomes impassable. The bottom of the fins resembles a sandy beach leading up to Sand Dune Arch. There are places to play hide and seek along the way, and plenty of things to explore. Under the arch, on the left, is a small ledge where you can climb up and take a trail leading behind the arch. Children and some adults might require help to reach this spot. The second option is to walk directly under the arch and follow a route up the slick rock to the base. There are two rules to be aware of at Sand Dune Arch. One, you can NOT climb on the arch. It is against park policy. Two, you cannot write'' or carve your name in the sandstone. Unfortunately, you will see that others have recklessly defaced areas at this location. The entrance to Arches is located 5 miles north of Moab,UTalong Highway 191. The Sand Dune Arch Trailhead is located 16.2 miles north of the main Park Entrance Station. Sand Dune Arch Information: Distance - Round-Trip Length is 0.4 miles Skill Level - easy for all ages Hiking Time - in and out in 15 minutes, an hour or more to appease children. What to Bring - Nothing specific. Start - End Elevation - 5,169feet to 5,198 feet Elevation Change - 29 feet net elevation gain Pet Regulations - No Dogs Allowed A fact about some of the vegetation you hike through: One of the bushes is called Blackbrush, it is named for branches that turn black when wet or from age. The tips of the branches are usually spiny, and the flowers are small and yellow. This plant is a member of the rose family. One August 2009 reviewer said, Just a few minutes' walk from the parking area, this arch is easy to reach. It's also small enough that visitors can climb on it. Finally, it's reasonably shaded by large surrounding sandstone walls, so on a hot day, it's nice to visit. Based on size alone, it's not impressive, but the other factors make it a must visit for families.'' This June 2009 reviewer said, This arch is close enough to the road that almost anyone can reach it easily, which means you won't be alone there. For better or worse, the arch is an invitation to both climb on, and play in the sand under. If you have small children this is a good stop, but don't come here to commune with nature. As part of the loop with Broken and Tapestry Arches, this is a nice contrast and a good hike.''"

There is a 6-story tower that has a total of 8 slides coming out of it. 7 of which are different slides. Pros: Good Selection of slides. Suitable for all ages. Good selection of food. Season passes are cheaper than going 3 times without one. Lots to do. Warm pools. Cons: VERY crowded not much shade, could use more adult slides.'' Frommer's review includes the adjoining ice rink. It said, This is the place for a wide variety of water fun: dozens of heated water attractions on 26 acres are set against the mountains. The facilities include a large wave pool, winding slides, children's pools, an activity pool, large pavilions and shaded cabanas, plenty of grass, a gift shop, and food vendors. Tubes are available for rent. The adjacent Peaks Ice Arena, built for the 2002 Olympics, contains two Olympic-size ice-skating rinks that are open to the public. Skate rental is available.

"Shafer Trail","Utah","Shafer Trail - Canyonlands National Park, Utah - Off Road Trail within National Park","Shafer Trail is a long off road trail at Canyonlands National Park, which is located at SW Resource Boulevard in Moab, Utah. It can be reached on US Highway 191 by driving to Utah Highway 313 and then moving 35 kilometers southwest. The Visitor Center is approximately a 40 minute drive from Moab. Canyonlands National Park is considered to be one of the world's great places for off-road adventure with 4X4 routes ranging from moderate to extremely difficult and technical. The Shafer Trail provides access to the White Rim Trail as well as other areas in the park and is perhaps one of the most challenging journeys through the park. It requires extreme caution at the best of times for vehicles and mountain bikes, but especially so in inclement weather and at night. The trail can take up to 24 hours to negotiate and is suitable for four wheel drive vehicles only as the road becomes very rough. The trail is also very narrow in places with the cliff face on one side and a sheer drop of several hundred feet on the other, so this drive is probably unsuitable for wider vehicles as well as passengers uncomfortable with heights. It is important for visitors to take plenty of water with them on the journey, and previous visitors to the trail say whilst it can be a frightening journey at times, the views across the park are well worth the effort. Another big challenge here is the 100 mile White Rim Road, which can be accessed via the Shafer Trail and provides wonderful views of the area. Whilst this is a very popular trail it can take two or three days for a four wheel drive vehicle, or three to four days by mountain bike to negotiate and can also be quite dangerous. Permits are required for overnight trips along here and visitors are again advised to bring plenty of water with them. The Visitor Center is open throughout the year from 9am to 4.30pm with some extended hours between March and October. Here visitors will find various exhibits and interesting information about the attractions here such as Island in the Sky, as well as the other trails at the park along with an orientation video. Bottled water can be purchased at the Visitor Center but is not available anywhere else, so it is important to bring a supply along as well Camping is popular in this area with the Willow Flat Campground open throughout the year on a first-come, first-served basis. There are twelve sites furnished with tables, fire grills and vault toilets but there is no firewood or water available, and the maximum group size is ten people with vehicles limited to two for each group. There are twenty campsites arranged in ten camping areas along the various trails of the White Rim Road, with each one accommodating up to 15 people and three vehicles."

Close to the sights we were interested in and easy to find. Nice pool and spa although I didn't like that we had to walk through the reception to get to it. Restaurant was nice, simple food but tasty, and the breakfast had good choices. I'm fussy and the waitress even gave me a few extra options. Service was average.'' Another reviewer stated, The front desk and housekeeping staff were Utah friendly, but they just couldn't make up for the declining nature of this hotel. The first problem you'll notice is that there are only two elevators to serve 200 rooms on 12 floors. To make things worse, there is no service elevator, so your most frequent companions all day long will be housekeepers and their carts.

"Slickrock Bike Trail","Utah","Slickrock Bike Trail","Slickrock Bike Trail is considered the mountain biking trail in the world. Each year this trail sees at least 100,000 bikers. The trail was first developed in 1969 by motorcyclists, who occasionally use the trail today. However, it is the mountain bikers who dominate the trail today. The name Slickrock came from the metal shod horses that early settlers tried to use in the area. The rock is sandstone, therefore the horseshoes would move slickly over the rock, having a hard time gaining purchases. Today the friction with bike tires provides an option to defy gravity.  Once a rider can master the rocks it is an invigorating experience because one can tilt or angle the bike in numerous ways to make it more challenging. The rocks have a certain path, but there are also deviations from the path that one can take. These are shown by the painted on markers. The entire trail is full of these amazing sandstone cliffs, where visitors can see the Colorado River and tributaries as they move along the trail. There is even the view of La Sals, which is 12,000 feet tall. Slickrock Bike Trail is 12 miles long and takes at least 4 hours for the loop trip."

Our new friend Mary said regarding Snowbasin: There is no comparison. It's like comparing Burger King to a five-star restaurant. Given that Mary has a nineteenth-century harpsichord in her house and a vintage bust of Marie Antoinette or something, I kind of trust her to make metaphors like that. Oh man. All I could think for the entire two days we were there was why are there not more people on this mountain? For reals. It's godly nice and tricked out because the Olympics were there, but seriously, you can go down the entire mountain on a Saturday afternoon in early March without seeing a single other person. Lift lines were like, three minutes, at the most. Unbelievable. Where did everyone go? Maybe the only thing bad about it is that the selection of green slopes is pretty limited, with only one real route taking you down from one life. Then there are two lifts that service mostly intermediate slopes and one (John Paul) that has some harder terrain. I was all over the map with my new ski buddy and pretty much everywhere we went was astounding. On trail, off trail. Things are set up so that you always have a wuss-out option if you end up somewhere that you didn't want to be by accident. Beautiful views, great weather, great powder. Snowbasin made me love skiing again.'' Another 2009 reviewer said, Impressive, to say the least. Big vertical, tons of terrain for all levels, fast lifts & a layout that makes sense, beautiful mountains & views everywhere, lack of crowds & outstanding lodges ... the list just goes on at Snowbasin. I've hit all the major SLC resorts & I think Snowbasin has them beat. That is high praise. If you're serious about skiing/riding, Snowbasin will not disappoint. Can't recommend it highly enough.''"

They get a ton of storms coming thru that dump 2 to 5 feet of snow at a time. You need to stay at the resort when it snows since the road closes often and makes for the best days when everybody from salt lake can't come up there. Snowbird has a ton of steeps. cliffs and trees to ski. The tram to the top gives you good lines in every direction. If it gets icy in the front then go to mineral basin in the back for better snow. Snowbird also has some great backcountry runs accessible off of Gad 2 lift in scottys bowl. Little Cottonwood Canyon is the most avalanche prone area in the lower 48 so bring you avalanche gear. Its April 7 today and they have 550 inches with 2 feet more in the forecast. Where else that has dry snow has that much besides snowbird's neighbors alta and solitude.'' Another reviewer states, Snowbird is a Ski/Snowboarders paradise. I've done a lot of skiing in the Northeast US and loved it, but Snowbird just makes you realize what real skiing is all about. Any one who has ever liked this sport must make it to Snowbird.''"

To get to Soldier Hollow from Salt Lake City, take I-80 east to Silver Creek Junction (exit 146). Go east on U.S. 40 past Jordanelle Reservoir toward Heber City. Take right turn on Route 113 (100 South in Heber) and follow the road into Midway. Take a left and continue on route 113 for two miles. Turn right just before the railroad tracks and follow signs to Soldier Hollow. Located in Wasatch Mountain State Park, Soldier Hollow is about fifty three miles from downtown Salt Lake City. Facility information: Tubing Hill - has the longest tubing lanes in Utah with 1,200-foot sliding lanes and lift service to tow people up the hill. There are lights, so you can tube day or night and a sound system for music. Soldier Hollow limits the sale of tubing tickets in order to assure a quality experience.

Purchase artwork directly from Native American artists who come from all over the United States and sample authentic Native American food. This event is traditionally held the end of June for a three day period. This online reviewer said, There were 6 tubing lanes in total, but only 5 were open. There are 2 hour sessions starting at noon, 2:00, and 4:00. Get there early to get the most of your money. The 2:00 got crowded. What we liked about this spot was that they did not oversell the tubing. Gorganzola would sell more tickets than they had tubes for. We experienced this at Goganzola earlier in the week. There was also night tubing. The hill had chairs for parents to use while the kids were tubing. There was also a VERY nice lodge if you wanted to sit inside. The sun was out and made it very hot for the kids. Mine stripped off their jackets and sweaters until they got down to their T-Shirts. Pack a T-Shirt in case or wear one if you go in March as it gets HOT.''"
"Solitude Mountain","Utah","Solitude Mountain - Solitude, Utah - Skiing, Hiking, Family-friendly","Solitude Mountain is the location of a local ski resort in Utah. The mountain has sixty-four named runs and three bowls. There are over twelve hundred acres of terrain with such a variety of vertical lift the marketing promise is that there is something for everyone. The brochure boasts, On Solitude you'll find wide-open powder bowls, runs that wind through glades of trees, steep chutes, and gentle cruising boulevards. Honeycomb trail is the longest descent and is three and one half miles from top to bottom. Twenty percent of the runs are geared toward the beginning skier; fifty percent are for intermediate, and thirty percent are designated for the advanced/expert skier.'' With an average snowfall of five hundred inches a year, Solitude also maintains the ski slopes by making snow if it is needed. This allows Solitude to supply additional coverage in high-traffic areas and provides a consistent snow experience throughout the season. Located in the small village of Solitude, this mountain can be found by driving out of Salt Lake City, Utah and heading twelve mile up Big Cottonwood Canyon. The winter season typically opens mid November and runs through mid April depending on the weather. Lodging and dining facilities on the mountain are open year-round. The general hours of operation are from 9am to 4pm. Check with the resort for special events throughout the year including night skiing hours and unique summer activities. Solitude mountain statistics follow: Top elevation is 10,035 feet (or 3,059 m) at the Summit Chair Top. Bottom elevation is 7,988 feet (or 2,435 m) at the Eagle Express Chair Bottom. The village elevation, where you will find most of the lodging and dining options, is 8,175 feet. There is a vertical drop of 2,047 feet (or 624 m). The mountain encompasses over twelve hundred acres of land and in 2008 there were eight lifts on the mountain. With a combination of quads, triples and double lifts, the uphill capacity is 14,450 riders per hour. Besides all the winter sports, there are many summer activities on the mountain, such as mountain biking, disc golfing and the ability to hike a huge number of trails. The ski area opened in the fall of 1957 with two chair lifts providing access to the front of the mountain. A rich anecdote in Solitude's history explains how Robert M. Barrett made his fortune as a Moab uranium miner during the early 1950s. When moved to Salt Lake City he took up skiing and pursued his passion at Alta, (Solitude's rival ski resort). When he was told that restrooms at Alta could only to be used by guests staying overnight at the lodge because the small resort had to transport waste down the canyon, Barrett was furious. Spurred by his irritation with Alta's restroom policy, Robert Barrett purchased every piece of land available in the canyon adjacent to Alta and started construction on Solitude in 1956. Today Solitude Mountain provides a majestic focal point for the small European style Alpine resort. This intimate village was designed to keep the serene mountain ambiance intact. Current advertising promises that the complete lack of over-crowding assures nothing and no one will ever stand between you and your Solitude.''"

You can fish nearby Big Cottonwood Creek or take your children under twelve fishing in the rainbow trout stocked Solitude pond. The DeSeelhorst family developed Solitude Mountain resort over many years. This is the only development allowed in Big Cottonwood Canyon, so Solitude's Village feels isolated and unique. Since the European-style village was designed to maintain the serene mountain ambiance surrounding the resort, as the brochure says, With quaint shops, exquisite dining, comfortable lodging amidst first-class service and amenities, there really is no place like Solitude.''"

"Sugar House Neighborhood","Utah","Sugar House Neighborhood - Salt Lake City, Utah - A historical neighborhood consisting of residential areas, as well as businesses","The Sugar House neighborhood of Salt Lake City is located in an area with boundaries from about 700 East St, at its western edge to 2000 East at the east and 1300 South to about 2700 South St. In 1853, six years after Brigham Young and other Mormon Church members arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, the Sugar House neighborhood was established. The area was named after a proposed sugar mill that was to be built in the area, but the plan was ultimately halted when the materials for the mill's construction never arrived from France. Although the sugar mill was never completed, the area kept the name of Sugar House and became the home of the first Utah State Prison, known as the Sugar House Prison. The prison remained in operation until the mid 20th century when it was demolished and replaced with Sugar House Park and Highland High School. Eventually this neighborhood became one of the main commercial centers in the area, especially for furniture stores. One of the Sugar House streets was known locally as furniture row because of the three major furniture stores located there. During the 1980s the Sugar House neighborhood deteriorated, becoming an extremely crime ridden area of the city, but in the latter part of the 20th century the neighborhood went through an intense revitalizing period. Today, many people in Salt Lake City consider the Sugar House neighborhood to be one of the more desirable neighborhoods to live in. The area is home to strip malls, and numerous other major businesses. One large business district houses businesses such as a ShopKo, a Toys YA Us, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, an Old Navy store, as well as a Bed Bath & Beyond, PetSmart, and numerous fast food and family restaurants. There is also a 10-screen Cinemark movie theater. In addition, the Sugar House neighborhood contains office buildings, Hidden Hollow Park, as well as Sugar House Park located between I-80, 2100 South, 1300 East, and 1700 East. During the 4th of July Celebrations, Sugar House Park is the location of one of the state's largest fireworks displays. In recent years there has been a big push for more redevelopment in the Sugar House area. One improvement that has been proposed is the development of a vintage style Rail Trolley to connect the Sugar House Business District to the TRAX station on 2100 S, in Salt Lake City. Some of the different areas associated with the Sugar House neighborhood include Highland Park, Oak Hills, and the Harvard/ Yale area. The real estate in these areas vary from mansions priced at half a million dollars and more in the Harvard/Yale area, to the Highland Park area where people can pickup a house for around three hundred thousand. Sugar House is just one of several distinct neighborhoods in the Salt Lake City area; others include The Avenues, Rose Hill, Federal Heights, and Glendale."

My favorite garden was the secret garden, modeled after the garden in the book The Secret Garden, it is nearly hidden but that's what makes it so special. At first I thought the price was a little steep ($8), but I soon discovered it was well worth it.'' This reviewer on the Children's Discovery Garden said, Take your swimsuit on a hot summer day. The kids will spend hours running around, jumping in the fun Noah's Ark fountain, and exploring the interactive areas to discover nature. Check out the schedule beforehand and go on a day when there are free crafts workshops. The kids will never want to leave.''"
"The Avenues","Utah","The Avenues - Salt Lake City, Utah - The Avenues is a historic neighborhood on the Northeast Bench of Salt Lake City","Located northeast of downtown Salt Lake City, the Avenues is considered to be one of the trendiest areas to live in the city, and is especially attractive to people in the arts. The bottom of the Avenues is South Temple Street and from there the neighborhood is built up onto the lower slopes of the mountains. All of the streets that run north and south are named after letters, such as C Street, D Street, etc. The roads that run east to west are numbered from 1st to 18th Avenue. The Salt Lake City Cemetery is located in the upper avenues, with the lower Avenues chiefly consisting of historic Victorian style houses. In the past the area became very popular with young couples looking for affordable housing, but in recent years the houses in this area have become less affordable as many people seek out low traffic, non-congested neighborhoods in which to purchase their homes. The Avenues neighborhood was first surveyed in 1850, and deviated from other neighborhoods in the area because of its closely laid out streets and avenues. All of the streets in this neighborhood were named after either trees or had garden themed names. One of the main problems that residents of the Avenue faced in the 19th century was lack of water; the only way to get water to the area was if it was hauled and many people did not have piped water until the early 20th century. Despite this fact, The Avenues became a very popular neighborhood, especially with those were relocating Salt Lake City during the late 1800s. Although there was a deep decline of The Avenues in the middle of the 20th century, a project to revitalize the area was sponsored by the Greater Avenues Community Council, and today it is considered to be a popular and progressive neighborhood by the younger citizens of the city."

"The Golf Club at Thanksgiving Point","Utah","The Golf Club at Thanksgiving Point, Lehi, Utah - a Johnny Miller Signature Golf Course and the Largest Golf Club in the State","The Golf Club at Thanksgiving Point is an 18-hole championship-caliber course designed by Johnny Miller. The club is set amid the natural mountain desert landscape and covers more than 200 acres, making it the largest golf club in Utah. The par-72 course plays to a hefty 7,714 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 76.2 and a slope rating of 137, making it a course capable of hosting the best golfers in the world. From the Blue tees, the course plays to 6,784 and 6,344 yards from the Whites, making it playable for the high-handicappers as well. The course, which opened in 1997, is positioned at the narrow transition of land between Utah Valley and Salt Lake Valley, and makes use of the Jordan River, which comes into play on seven holes, to create a layout that is said to have golfers eagerly awaiting the diversity of each new hole. The course features a number of dogleg holes, elevated tees and greens, and wind that is virtually constant and adds both difficulty and diversity to every round.  The course also boasts 10,000 trees and 55 acres of sand, including what have been described as some nasty'' bunkers. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include its collection of par-3s, including Hole No. 4. This hole presents a challenge off an elevated tee to an undulating green far below, which can make club selection a difficult decision. Hole No. 7 is another of Thanksgiving Point's great par-3s, and features a long, forced carry over the Jordan River to a huge, tiered green. Hole No. 17 is another par-3 and the signature hole for the course. This hole plays to 250 yards from the longest tees, often into a prevailing headwind, which further adds to the length and the difficulty. The hole has been described as an absolute masterpiece,'' and makes use of a 180-degree bend in the Jordan River to position a wide, peninsular green. Hole No. 12 may be the best par-4 on the course. The hole plays up to 453 yards from the tips and features an elevated tee box to a landing area that wraps in serpentine fashion around a large lake.  Approach shots must then take aim at a tucked-away and undulating green. Since its opening, the Golf Club at Thanksgiving Point has received numerous accolades.

"The Narrows","Utah","The Narrows - Zion National Park, Utah - National Park, Slot Canyon Hike","The Zion Narrows is the most popular hiking route in Zion Park, and one of the world's best canyon hikes. The trail is the Virgin River, walking in the river water makes this hike tolerable during the hot months of summer. About sixty percent of this hike is in the water and the remaining time is on the riverbank. The water depth varies from knee-deep to waist-deep or higher. The longest exposure to waist-deep water is about twenty yards. Located off I-15, Zion National Park East Entrance is three hundred and twenty miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah, or one hundred and eighty three miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada. A flash flood or high river runoff will close the trail to hiking. Regular runoff usually occurs in April and early May. Late summer thunderstorms can also produce flooding. You must check at the visitor center for current conditions and specific rules and regulations governing this hike. Technically you can hike this trail year round as long as the river isn't flooded. However, where hiking during summer and fall is pleasant, few people hike during winter and spring when the water is cold unless they are wearing wet or dry suits. There are three ways to hike the narrows. The most popular way is to hike in from the bottom. Go as far as you're comfortable and then hike out the same day. First-time river hikers or visitors with only a short time in the park will need to choose this option. Depending on water flow, this hike is rated easy to moderate, in summer months and most kids four feet or taller can manage the hike. From the parking lot, it usually takes about two to three hours until you reach the section of Narrows known as Wall Street. It generally takes two-thirds the time to hike back as it did to hike in. If you're a serious, prepared hiker you can start at the top and hike the entire sixteen miles as a long day hike. This is the most strenuous option and is only recommended for athletic people who are very agile hikers. The best time for this hike is May through September when days are longer. This is usually a ten to fourteen hour hike for most athletes. A permit is required for this hike. The third option is to hike from the top down and backpack in for one or more nights. With the overnight or more option hikers include additional trails along the route. You will have to get a hiking permit if you start at the top. This is the way to have the full Narrows experience. Tips for visiting: October and November visitors find less people in the river. Best light for photography is from May to September between the hours of 10am and 3pm. Average hikers travel three to four miles up the canyon. (This means it's also three to four miles back.) A June 2009 review states, We just returned from a trip that took us to Zion for a few days. We took an entire day to hike the Narrows. We hiked about 3 miles up to the narrowest part of the canyon. The first mile is on paved area and is somewhat boring. But once you hit the water, it is amazing. The scenery is great...the walls of the canyon are so close. You will be hiking up stream in water the entire way until you decide to turn back. I would definitely recommend a hiking stick, as the rocks are hard to maneuver on your own. When we went, the water was relatively low. Most was ankle deep with the deepest spots being a little below waist deep. Our seven-year-old boy went and he had a great time. He played in the water, found rocks and just had a ball. I would recommend this be your number one item when visiting Zion...it was by far the best hike there. We left around 10am and didn't return until around 6...we took our time, played in the water and again, hiked 3 miles up the water. It gets really cool in late afternoon and evening, so I'd recommend you plan for this when you are going. It was downright cold on our walk back out. The walk back goes a bit faster than the walk up as you are going downstream on the way out.'' A July 2009 review reports, I absolutely can't imagine this hike without a hiking stick to help gauge the water depth as well as to support against the current. The shoe rental ones looked cumbersome as they are wooden, resembling a 5-6 foot pencil with a point that is smashed flat by the time you finish hiking. I think they do a better job of advertising. When we went we seriously debated renting the shoes and were glad we just wore hiking boots and our teens wore old sneakers. We went in late June and were glad to be cooled by the water on a 90-degree day. There will be some spots that are at least waist deep so be prepared to keep valuables, cameras, etc dry. Also there are sand bars that have some drops, so use your hiking stick to avoid surprises. Suggestion: wear swim trunks or quick dry clothes for your comfort, especially on the shuttle ride back.''"
"The Needles","Utah","The Needles - Canyonlands National Park, Utah - Geological Feature at Scenic Park","The Needles is an attraction at Canyonlands National Park, which is located at SW Resource Boulevard in Moab, Utah. It can be reached on US Highway 191 by driving 40 miles south of Moab or 14 miles north of Monticello, then taking Utah Highway 211 approximately 35 miles west. Highway 211 ends in the Needles and is the only paved road leading in and out of the district. The Needles District was so named for the colorful spires of Cedar Mesa Sandstone that stand out in the southeast corner of Canyonlands. Here there is a long trail system offering visitors spectacular views as they take long day hikes and overnight trips. The trails and roads mean visitors can walk or drive to features as Tower Ruin, Confluence Overlook, Elephant Hill, the Joint Trail, and Chesler Park. Created up to 286 million years ago, the red and white sandstone layer of the Needles spires was once a dune field on the edge of a shallow sea that covered what are now the states of California, Nevada and western Utah. Layers of red and white sand were laid down on top of each other and created the rocks now seen at The Needles. They occur in an area with many fractures carved out from the Colorado plateau, which was pushed up thousands of feet before being attacked through erosion. There are up to 60 miles of interconnecting trails here with varying degrees of difficulty and include the Chesler Park/Joint Trail, which offers scenic views of colorful sandstone spires as well as desert grasses and shrubs. This is approximately an 11 mile round trip, but one of the shorter trails is the Big Spring to Squaw Canyon at about 7.5 miles. This also happens to be one of the steepest climbs and is not recommended for people afraid of heights. The Visitor Center is open throughout the year from 9am to 4.30pm with some extended hours between March and October. Here visitors will find various exhibits and interesting information about The Needles. Interpretive programs are offered between March and October including most evenings at the Squaw Flat Campground, and visitors can check for presentation times at the Visitor Center. Camping is very popular in this area and there are 26 sites available on a first come first served basis at the Squaw Flat Campground, which is a good base camp for hikers to seek out destinations like Chesler Park, Druid Arch and the Joint Trail. The sites are available throughout the year and feature bathrooms, fire grates, picnic tables, tent pads and water with a group size limit of 10 people and 2 vehicles. Three other campsites in the Needles district are the Squaw Flat Group Site, which can hold up to 50 people and 10 vehicles, the Wooden Shoe Group Site can hold up to 25 people and 5 vehicles, whilst the Split Top Group Site can hold up to 15 people and 3 vehicles."

"The Wave at Coyote Buttes","Utah","The Wave at Coyote Buttes - Kanab, Utah - Geological oddity, hiking","The Wave is a multihued sandstone chute that was cut into the mountain by natural forces. Swirled bands of color run through eroded shapes. The colors and shapes change with the light as the day progresses. Red, pink, yellow and green rock has blended together to form castles, beehives, chutes and other structures. This is a great, short, moderately difficult day hike. The Coyote Buttes are part of an area under special management by the BLM. You need a permit for access and they must be reserved months in advance. Ten per day are reserved, and ten per day are released by lottery drawing in the BLM office. This is a popular attraction so reserve a spot ahead of time if you can. Coyote Buttes is located in Paria Canyon on the edge of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Directions to the canyon from Mount Carmel Junction: drive 17 miles to Kanab. Leave Kanab, drive 40 miles east on Highway 89. The turn-off is located on the south (right side coming from Kanab) side of the road. It's between mile markers 25 and 26, at a curve in the road, at the end of a guard rail. Turn at the unmarked dirt road. This is House Rock Road. Along this road, about 4.2mi south of US89 you will pass the Buckskin Trailhead on your left; 3.7mi further on you will find the Wire Pass Trailhead. This trailhead has a broad parking area and a restroom on the right side of the road. The actual trailhead is on the left. Tips for visiting: The best hiking conditions are found in spring and fall. Summer temperatures get very hot, sometimes reaching over 100 F. Hiking can be pleasant during warm days in winter, but at night the temperatures can drop drastically. The Wave trailhead is at Wire Pass, which also serves as the trailhead for Buckskin Gulch, one of the world's best long slot canyon hikes. The Wave Trail Information: Hiking time - 6 hours round trip Estimated hiking distance - 6 miles Elevation gain - 340 feet Restroom - at trailhead Trail conditions - starts out a little sandy, then over rock On USGS Topography Maps - Pine Hollow Canyon, Coyote Buttes Difficulties - A modest navigational challenge Special equipment - A compass and topography map, a gallon of water per person Sun Exposure - Full sun. Dark red rock and sand reflect the sun, amplifying the heat. Restrictions - Protected area. Permit must be obtained in advance from BLM. Camping - No, it is not allowed. The hike starts across a trail-less rocky landscape from the Wire Pass Trailhead to The Wave. Besides a modest navigational challenge it is a relatively easy hike across barren desert mountain terrain. Once you've reached your destination take time to explore the various gullies. The area by The Wave is not large but you should take time to explore the various gullies where this unusual psychedelic phenomenon occurs. It looks as though the rock has been folded back upon itself - several times. Climb above the contorted, wavy strata into the bowl at the base of the black crack that cuts the cliffs in half. High overhead on the ridgeline there is a substantial natural arch. One online reviewer in 2009 said, Yep this is as good as it gets. We arrived at the Ranger station in Kanab Ut to test our luck. After 3 days of waiting we got our permits. Jan 4th 2009 We started the hike in around 5am it was 16 degrees when we started and 19 when we finished. The trail was almost completely covered with snow. When we arrived it was breath taken. I have wanted to get here for about a year after a friend told me about it. During winter months make sure you have 4 wheel drive and chains to get to the trail head. Also make sure you dress warm. 10 permits are raffled each day at the ranger station. Maybe you'll get lucky.'' Another online reviewer said, It's said that The Wave is one of the most photographed landscapes in the United States. That may be so, but the place is in a rugged area in the middle of nowhere - in Arizona, halfway between Kanab, Utah, and Page, Arizona - and only 20 people are allowed in by the lottery system. On a recent visit to the BLM office west of Big Water, Utah, that issues the permits, I watched a German couple almost cry because they didn't win a slot after three days of participation in the lottery system. They flew from Germany to Arizona just for this and they were going to return home heartbroken. Although many others didn't win a slot, I got lucky. I was so excited that I got little sleep. Before dawn the next day, I was on the road and at the trail head in no time. The BLM provided a good map and cairns along the way provided additional assistance for the tough, but pleasurable hike. I was the first to reach The Wave and it was overwhelming to stand in the middle of mounds of uninhibited, sloppy, pulled salt-water taffy landscape. I pulled out my camera and tripod immediately and started running and snapping photos like a lunatic. This place is pornographic in its splendor with the colors and stripes and curves that tattooed themselves into my eye sockets.

Harriman chose this site for his state-of-the-art trolley car system. Investing $3.5 million on an unusual, mission-style carbarn complex, within six years of opening more than 144 trolleys served the Salt Lake Valley from this site until the transit line was discontinued in 1945. The old and decaying complex was saved from demolition in 1972 when the carbarns were transformed into Trolley Square.

I love all the shops that they have and Rodizio's is definitely the best restaurant that Salt Lake has to offer. I recommend it for everybody. Every year Trolley Square had something different about it that makes it so much better.''

Tuacahn's Christmas Festival of Lights is presented every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings from the day after Thanksgiving to December 23rd. Entrance to the Festival of Lights is free to the public. February 2009 reviewer said, Went to the festival of light which is held after thanksgiving to Christmas time. They decorate with lights and have an open pit bonfire with hot chocolate you can buy which was good. They also have their regular souvenir shop which is fun with a lot of interesting things. You can also buy a ticket to the theatre for a live nativity which was ok, but I enjoyed the lights etc part more they also have a small train all lit up you can ride on and carriage ride. It was neat because this theatre is out by itself away from lights so it is really bright and a beautiful place to visit anyway with the red rock. It is free to see the lights and visit, but the live nativity was 10.00 a family, the train ride and carriage ride cost about 3.00 person. During the rest of the year they have a variety of outdoor plays etc set against the red rock backdrop.''"
"U-Dig Fossils","Utah","U-Dig Fossils - Delta, Utah - Fossil quarry, U-dig, Trilobites","U-Dig Fossils is a private, family run quarry west of Delta, Utah. Containing one of the world's richest deposits of trilobites, at this site you can dig and find your own fossils. The fossils are found in limestone shale rocks that split easily into flat sheets, revealing the trilobite fossils. Bring your own hammer, or U-Dig Fossils can provide one. If you want to dig deeper and remove fresh rock for yourself, larger tools are available. You don't need to do that, though. U-Dig regularly extracts fresh chunks of fossil-bearing rock with heavy equipment. A form of invertebrate marine life, trilobites lived more than 500 million years ago. Today they are extinct. These hard-shelled prehistoric critters roamed the sea floor and coral reefs in search of food. They are one of the most popular fossils with collectors because there are so many varieties and they are often preserved in excellent condition. The most common trilobite species found at the Quarry are: Asaphiscus wheeleri, Elrathia kingi, or Peronopsis interstricta. Alokistocare harrisi, Bolasidella housensis, and Olenoides nevadensis are some of the rarer species that have been found. Other fossils, including brachiopods, sponges, worm tracks, and phyllocarids, can be uncovered, but they are harder to come by. The fossils range in length from an eighth of an inch, to two inches. Most visitors to the park find ten to twenty trilobites in a four-hour period. The U-Dig staff will roam the quarry area and are happy to show you how to find the richest veins of fossil-bearing rock. These men will you how to split the rock to find trilobites, and can help identify what you find. There is forty acres at the quarry. Fresh rock is exposed with an excavator on a regular basis. The quarry can provide hammers to split the shale, buckets to hold your collection and to transport fossils to your vehicle in the parking area. They will provide digging instructions and assistance with finding and identifying fossils. There are toilet facilities at the quarry. The U-DIG Fossils quarry opens for the season in the middle of March. Business hours are Monday through Saturday from 9am to 6pm.The quarry is closed on Sundays. It is open on some holidays during the season. Please arrive at the quarry before 4pm, as it closes early if no one is present by then. Do not attempt to enter the quarry when it is closed. The quarry is located approximately fifty two miles west of Delta, Utah. It is near Antelope Springs. It is approximately ninety miles from Provo to Delta and approximately one hundred and thirty miles from Salt Lake City to Delta. Once in Delta, travel thirty two miles west on Highway 6 / 50. At the Long Ridge Reservoir sign between mile markers 56-57, turn right. There is a U-DIG Fossils sign at this intersection. Then travel twenty miles down a well-maintained gravel road to reach the quarry. Any type of vehicle can travel this gravel road. Tips for visiting the quarry - bring a pair of gloves to protect your hands. Garden gloves are adequate. Wear sturdy shoes to protect your feet from dust and sharp rock and bring a light jacket in case the weather changes. Depending on the time of your visit, you might want to bring beverages and a light lunch. Take plenty of water. It is also important to bring safety glasses. The quarry is not allowed to provide eye protection due to health concerns. Splitting rock can create shards of stone, which could injure your eyes if not protected. Inexpensive safety glasses are available at most hardware stores. Pricing for the quarry is based on age and length of stay. Age groups are from 7 to 16, and 17 and older. There is no charge for children under six if accompanied by a paying adult. Length of stay charges are broken into two, four and eight hour time periods. Group discounts are available for ten or more. There is also a discount for Boy Scout groups and local school groups. A discount of 20% is available for Utah residents who can show a driver's license. The quarry accepts cash, checks, and all major credit cards. They prefer cash. Leashed dogs are allowed at the quarry, be sure to bring extra water. There is plenty of room for RV's at the site. There is no organized camping; however much of the land around the U-DIG Quarry is BLM or public land. You can camp anywhere you want on BLM land. The camping is primitive camping only. Pick a spot below or above the U-DIG Quarry. The nearest food and gas is in Delta, fifty two miles away. One online reviewer said, I just got back from my second trip to U-dig fossil quarry. This time I found even more fossils than the last (in 2000), including a completely intact 2-inch Elraithia, and numerous complete baby Asaphiscus. I found 75+ complete to near complete trilobites in a 5 hour period. The guides are very helpful and will provide tools if you do not choose to bring your own. I recommend wearing mechanic's' gloves, as regular garden or work gloves will not allow for fine-tuning of rock matrix around your trilobite with the hammer. I think the most beautifully intact and well-preserved fossils can be found in the solid black rock but if you look in the softer layers you can occasionally find a nice specimen that just flakes right out of the matrix. My 4 year old son was a bit young to really get into this (at least after the first two hours we were there!) but enjoyed playing with trucks and sand toys in the dirt. Thanks for a great time, U-dig, we'll be back!!!'' Another reviewer said, We made the long trip from Florida to the U-dig mine this August with the Fairygodmother Make A Wish Foundation. (Wish foundation for people with life limiting illness) The folks at U-dig were absolutely wonderful with making this happen for us. We can't thank these fine, thoughtful people enough, and would like to tell you about our wonderful experience at the U-dig mine. The three of us, (Myself, my 6 year old son and wife) Stayed in Delta then got up early to beat the heat at the U-dig mine. The mine was easy to find, and the roads were passable by just about any kind of vehicle. There were several signs so the quarry was easy to find. It was cool when we arrived, and the staff was absolutely wonderful about showing us where and how to dig. Splitting the rock was not that hard, and the fossils were not hard to find. With a little looking you could find really beautiful specimens. About noon it became kind of hot, but not unbearable if you bring plenty of water and maybe some snacks. Be sure to bring sunscreen. We found around 30 really nice fossils in about 3.5 hrs. We only left the mine because my portable oxygen had run out! We would have loved to have stayed longer, it's quite addicting once the fossils start showing up, which is almost immediately.''"

One online reviewer said, One of the nicest views of the Wasatch Mountains from the food court windows. It's all windows all views. Nice! Other than the view it's a standard mall found in anytown, USA.'' Another reviewer said, When I first moved here, I thought this place was it. Unfortunately, I think I was only comparing it to Provo Towne Centre. While University Mall has the main stores I shop at, that only accounts for two stores. But holy crap, there are jewelry stores on practically every corner of the place....and of course they always have customers - especially during spring - good night! People like to get engaged once the weather tops the 50s. Overall, many of the stores cater to the same demographic as Provo Towne Centre, so it's pretty much just the same as PTC but with a few more high-end stores catering to a slighter older crowd. The benefit to the University Mall is that they have three restaurants attached to the mall, and other restaurants scattered close to the mall. CPK, PF Changs, and the Spaghetti Factory all help shoppers to take a load off from all of their shopping to enjoy some food.''"
"Utah Field House of Natural History State Park","Utah","Utah Field House of Natural History State Park - Vernal, Utah - Natural History Museum, State Park, Dinosaur Information","At the center of this state park is the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum. In 1945, construction was approved for a state-owned natural history museum in Vernal. Including, A suitable building for the purpose of housing and displaying the fossil remains of ancient plant and animal life and other objects of Natural History.'' This building was the original Utah Field House of Natural History. The new museum is located two blocks east of the old Field House. It is a 22,000-square foot structure meant to preserve and reveal the wealth of prehistory found within the Uinta Basin. In the museum you'll find geologic, paleontological, archaeological and biologic specimens displayed. Outside the museum is the Dinosaur Garden. This prehistoric zoo is full of life-size replicas ranging in age from Pennsylvanian through Pleistocene. The garden has a twenty-foot Tyrannosaurus with six-inch, knife-like teeth, a horned Triceratops, six-ton Stegosaurus, winged Pteranodon and other full-size prehistoric animal replicas. The museum is open Monday through Saturday, from 9am to 5pm. There is a charge with adult pricing, Utah seniors and children are half price and children under five are free. The Utah Field House of Natural History is located inside the city limits of Vernal. The address is 235 E Main Street in Vernal, Utah. In 1942, Arthur G. Nord of the U.S. Forest Service wrote the following, In some corner of most every museum of natural history there is found remnants of prehistoric life, much of which has come from (the) Uintah Basin. The guides in these institutions can thrill one with interesting information. Nothing could be more appropriate than to have a field museum with specimens of the natural and also artificial creations of the prehistoric life right in the heart of the area in which it is found.'' The Field House has certainly lived up to his vision. Exhibits include nearly three billion years of earth history as it is exposed in the nearby Uinta Mountains and Uinta Basin. What you will find: A small gift shop Science reference library A classroom Geology hall - fossils are displayed including algae, dinosaurs, and highly advanced mammals Anthropology hall - examples of ancient and recent Native American life in the Uintas Natural history hall - examples of local animal life Dinosaur Garden - seventeen full-size dinosaur replicas with a swamp area, rock area, small lake and a waterfall Park Elevation is 5,300 feet Located on 2 acres There is a picnic area behind the museum Summer evening lectures in the garden amphitheater No camping available June 2009 online review stated, Our family was in the Flaming Gorge area for over a week and while my husband fished, my 7 year old son and I had Dinosaur adventures on the agenda. The Utah Field House Museum became one of the highlights of the trip. (According to my son, it was his favorite thing!) You can't miss this little gem, the building is halfway surrounded by near lifelike dinosaur statues and a Wooly Mammoth too. Driving around the Flaming Gorge area you can't help but notice the vast changes in topography, this little but modern museum provides insight into the geology of the area. We spent a few hours there and consider it a must see if you're visiting the area. And if you're hungry, walk up the road a block to the Dinosaur Brew Haus, the best hamburger I have ever tasted and the brisket sandwich was delicious too.'' Another online reviewer reported, This Museum is phenomenal! It was an unscheduled attraction on our 8-day journey across Colorado and made it to the highlights of our trip. We just happened to drive through Vernal on our way home. The Field House of Natural History is very well maintained; the staff is very friendly and helpful. For families, I highly recommend participating in the Junior Paleo or Peewee Paleo program because it gives kids a purpose and helps explain the things that they see. We are planning to come back to Vernal to spend more time. The museum captured our interest.''"

My kids love to go and skate a while then jog a bit on the track. Basically, I think it is a good environment for my kids to encourage a healthy lifestyle. I love skating on the 400 meter oval since I can pick up some speed, I have a fair bit of breathing room and I am not constantly turning as I am when public skating on a hockey rink. That said, the public skate hours could be better. The price is right ($99.00 for the family for the year), but the reason for the low price is the relatively scant offerings.'' A second reviewer said, Best ice on earth. Large skating area, two fields for soccer, football, and hockey, track for running, exercise bikes, great for hockey skaters, figure skaters, or speed skaters.''"

"Weeping Rock Trail","Utah","Weeping Rock Trail","Weeping Rock Trail is a half mile trail in Zion National Park, Utah. It offers a moderately steep climb, despite being the shortest trail in the entire park. It can be done in one hour by hiking the short trail upwards. Trail conditions are also pleasant with paving. Wheelchairs and strollers can even make the climb. Weeping Rock Trail is one of the cooler hikes due to the amount of shade provided by the natural surroundings. The trailhead is best for spring to fall access, especially for those who want to cool off from the shade of the rocks.  It is called Weeping Rock Trail because of the waterfall. A waterfall literally makes its way through the rock in order to reach the creek below. Trail access is near Zion Canyon Visitors Center or Canyon Junction.

Visitors should never go to the edge of the cliff since the rocks can be slippery. The trail tends to close in winter due to icy conditions, but this is based on the snow fall for the year."

Banquet facilities are limited and the Castle Dome Cafy is open only during summer season. One July 2009 online reviewer said, The hotel met my exact expectations. A no frills experience with great location and Spartan amenities. Staff was very nice, rooms were clean but could have had better attention to detail. I booked a room with A/C and definitely recommend a room with A/C during summer. Zion is not as high in the plateau as Grand Canyon and so can be hot. Opening the window is not an option as million of bugs will get in. As for food, I strongly recommend you to bring your own. Food inside the park is not very good and the closest to highway robbery I've even been. It is shamelessly expensive. High speed Internet worked surprisingly well, but sometimes a few feet to the right or left inside your room (or lodge) makes a big difference.'' Another online reviewer said, The lodge sits right in the middle of the park. The location can't be beat. You get a very basic room for the money. Our room had a nice balcony facing lawn and a nice view of the towering scenery.''"

"Zion's Main Canyon","Utah","Zion's Main Canyon - Zion National Park, Utah - National Park, camping, hiking","The most popular route through Zion, the Main Canyon includes the Emerald Pools, the Narrows Hike, Weeping Rock, and Hidden Canyon. You reach the canyon by a turning off State Highway 9 before reaching the junction with the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. In this part of the park you'll find the main visitor center and several campgrounds. Most of the visitor facilities are in this part of the park. You'll find viewpoints and hiking trails that range from extended backcountry trails to easy ten minute strolls. Zion Canyon offers include the famous Narrows Trail which follows the upper stretches of the Virgin River. If you don't want to hike, many of the most spectacular features of the canyon can be seen from the road. Or you can take a short walk to several overlooks. Many of the viewpoints are of huge cliffs like The Pulpit and The Great White Throne, but you will also find short paths leading to pools, waterfalls, and the river. Several points of interest in the Main Canyon include Weeping Rock. This seeping waterfall has hanging curtains vegetation and it can be reached by a trail which extends into Hidden Canyon and Echo Canyon, two of the narrow side-branches of the main canyon. The rock formations in this part of the park are a little different; more varied in color and more intimate in scale. Sheer red and white sandstone cliffs tower over 2,500 feet above the North Fork of the Virgin River until they gradually get closer together upstream until there's only thirty feet separating them in places. From an August 2009 reviewer, If you like hiking, be sure to rent water booties & walking sticks from an outfitter next to The Spotted Dog Cafe. This allows you to walk up the Narrows which is at the end of the canyon & at the end of the Riverside Walk. We walked 3 hrs up the Virgin River & 3 hrs back & saw incredible views. Less people the further you go up & the narrower it gets. Water level very rarely gets up to your chest.'' From a June 2009 review, We just got back from Zion and what a wonderful trip it was. We have an 11 and 13 year old and both are in love with Zion. We read many reviews about the Watchman campground before we booked this trip. They were so true and helpful. We booked our trip 6 months prior to camping. We stayed in site A16 in a tent trailer, a short walk to the river with access and the amphitheater which had interesting nightly Ranger presentations. The weather in June was great. Maybe a light rain or 2 but not a downpour. We spent the first 2 days exploring the campground near the river (lots of tadpoles and little fish) and checking out the wonderful shuttle trip up the canyon. This easy 90 minute round trip shuttle is informative and beautiful (My husband fell asleep it was so relaxing). We hiked the easy weeping rock trail one afternoon which got the kids excited to see what the other longer hikes produced. We rented canyon water shoes, neoprene socks and a walking stick at Zion Canyon Rentals(under $20.00per person) and did the Narrows on Thursday. What a wonderful experience for our family. The narrow canyons and river running right down the center (it is the trail) are like nothing I have ever seen or done. We left the visitors center at 10:30am. Arrived at the riverside trail to the Narrows at 11:15 and walked the 1 mile paved path to where it dead ends right into the river. We started our hike through the knee deep water at 11:45am. We hiked up the river to the Orderville Canyon junction (1 1/2 miles). We arrived there at 2:00pm. We played a bit in the very shallow waters of the Orderville Canyon part of the river where two people can stand arms length and touch both sides of the tall canyon walls. At 2:30pm we started the hike back down, arriving at the beginning by 4:30pm. It was a perfect day for our athletic kids and their simi in-shape parents. This is a must do for teenagers. Bring the camera in a couple Ziplocs. The pictures are priceless. On the last day we headed back to Zion Canyon Rentals for a tube ride down the Virgin River. It was an easy process. We put the tubes in the water right across the street from the rental place. The 1 1/2 hour ride down the 2 mile stretch of twisting, shallow river was a blast! My daughter and I went a second time for only $5.00 more. The cost for rentals and pick-up from the let-out spot was only $15.00 per person. Very worth it.''"
"Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway","Utah","Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway - Zion National Park, Utah - Scenic Byway, National Park","The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway scenic drive runs along Highway 9. This drive begins at the entry into Zion National Park, meanders through the mile long tunnel and along a highway that slowly winds down from a high plateau and ending at Mt. Carmel Junction. This drive starts from the east side of Zion through the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel, to the south side of the park. One of the first sites is the geological wonder Checkerboard Mesa. There are impressive hoodoos and twisted rock sculptures all the way up to the rim of the highway. After exiting the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel, the Great Arch and Beehives come will be in view. Zion Canyon is at the bottom of several tormenting switchbacks. Lower Zion Canyon is where the Zion Canyon Visitors Center and the Zion Human History Museum are found. The spire, Watchman, stands tall on the south side of the park. Located in Southern Utah, off I-15, Zion National Park East Entrance is three hundred and twenty miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah, or one hundred and eighty three miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada. From April through October the only access to the Scenic Drive is via shuttle. From October to April private vehicles can travel the Scenic Drive. Oversized vehicles (RV's, trailers, fifth wheels and most campers) are allowed to travel through the middle of the tunnel while rangers stop traffic on the other side. Ranger escorts are at the tunnel from 8am to 8pm. Check the National Park Service site for current info, escort fees and winter hours. The second tunnel in the park is so small that you can see from one end to the other when driving through. Semi-trucks are not allowed to travel through the park. One of the highlights of the drive is The Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. At a little over one mile long, this tunnel was blasted and cut in the thick Navajo sandstone during the early 1900s. Working on the tunnel's south side was not easy because the drop off to the canyon below is eight hundred feet. A May 2009 review states, While driving through the Zion tunnel is great, and the scenery astounding, as you exit, the trip to the shuttle, which you must use after May 1, or to Springdale, involves a drive along a winding, narrow, two-way road that borders the edge of a 3000-5000 foot sheer drop - with no guard rails. (They wouldn't do anything, but they would make one feel a bit better.) If you don't like heights, you will be terrified on this road. You have the alternative of returning by a roundabout route on regular roads if you vow never to get on this scenic drive again, as my husband did. Or, you can take the southern entrance to the park in the first place. I'm surprised that the people who describe this road don't mention the narrowness and steepness of the road. It is far, far scarier than Route 1 in California, which people do describe as an adventure, but which is just fine. This road is ten times as anxiety producing. But, again, it's the scenery - amazing - and much different from that which you see on the shuttle.'' A second reviewer reports on something my family discovered years ago. This experience is incredible. We happened upon this scenic drive at a time I'm sure no-one would think to go. It was in August, a Full Moon and around 1am. Yes I did say 1am. We had been to the Grand Canyon and decided to go north into Utah and travel west to Hwy 9 back down into Nevada. Being from a small State at the time (CT), the concept of traveling from one state to another in a short period of time seemed natural to us. NOT so out WEST! We pushed on, deciding NOT to find lodging for the night, and we were so glad we did. We entered the Park and were awe struck. The road and canyon walls, all aglow from the light of the Moon and the headlights of our car, created a magic that just wouldn't allow us to travel more than 2 miles an hour. We traveled this 10 mile stretch, stopping every so often to just take it all in, at a continuous 2 mph. This was 5 years ago and to this day, I tell everyone going to Utah that they must time their trip during a Full Moon.''"
"Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel","Utah","Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel","Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel in Zion National Park, Utah is a tunnel that allows cars to pass through a mountain. The tunnel is 5,613 feet, which runs through Pine Creek Canyon wall. It has a distance of 21 feet from the outside face of the rock to the center of the tunnel. On the west side is a masonry façade which was cut from the sandstone. The east side is a natural hole in the rock that connects to a bridge.  The construction of the tunnel was through mining techniques, which started with a stope and then worked out towards the edges. The tunnel has galleries in order to offer light and ventilation in the canyon wall. It has been repaired a few times over the years, especially since construction began on the tunnel in 1927. It was completed in 1930. The tunnel is located along Zion-Mount Carmel Highway, which links Zion to Grand Canyon National Park. The highway running through Mount Carmel is US 89, which is part of Utah State Route 9. The road is actually part of a loop tour from Zion, Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks to the north side of Grand Canyon National Park."
