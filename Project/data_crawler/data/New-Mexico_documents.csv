"Al's Run","New-Mexico","Al's Run - Taos, New Mexico - Steep Ski Slope, Heavy with Moguls","The sign above the lift-ticket booth at Taos Ski Valley puts the slope known as Al's Run in perspective: DON'T PANIC! You're looking at only 1/30 of Taos Ski Valley. We have many easy runs too!'' For a fact, Al's Run has gained a reputation, even among experts, as a famously difficult run.'' Travel and Leisure magazine went a bit further, listing it among the World's Scariest Ski Slopes.'' Indeed, it is so heavy with moguls and the drop is so steep that upon seeing Al's Run for the first time one skier described it as a gigantic egg carton that someone has stood on edge.'' The free-fall drop at the top of the run, mammoth-size moguls lower down, and excellent views of the village below make Al's Run a bucket list'' experience for experienced skiers from New Mexico, Colorado and far beyond. The run got its name from a local surgeon and ski enthusiast, Dr. Albert M. Rosen, who helped get Taos Ski Valley off the ground. The length of Al's Run is 1,800 vertical feet. Primary access from the base area at 9,400 feet is via two lifts that pass directly above the narrow bump run. One is a modern four-seat Poma, while the other is the original two-seater, a surface lift built in 1955 by adapting some old mining machinery. The latter is still used on busy weekends."

Situated at the end of Alameda Park, the zoo was initially created as a form of entertainment for train passengers who waited while trains were refueled. When the zoo was first opened, local residents gifted the zoo with exotic pets such as skunks, birds and raccoons. In the 1970's and 1980's, the original chain link fences that once served as cages were replaced. During the 1970's, the zoo became a rundown haven for drifters, faced with closing the zoo or upgrading the facilities, the city added perimeter fencing in 1986, to control access. The Alameda Park Zoo is the smallest zoo to be accredited by the Association for Zoos and Aquariums, which means the zoo meets the rigorous criteria for high standards of animal care, education and conservation. The zoo is dedicated to a natural environment, education about the environment, recreation, biological research and conservation of local and global resources. Alameda Park Zoo strives to provide guests with the audio, visual and tactile means to understand the relationship between man and animals.

Notable species that can be found at the zoo include the Mexican Gray Wolf, the Hawaiian Goose, the Markhor Goat and the White Sands pupfish. Other more exotic species include African lions, cougars, bison and a wide variety of birds. The zoo is unique in that it promotes the survival and breeding of the threatened Mexican Gray Wolf, and participates in a Species Survival Plan through its facilities. Since 1994, the zoo has had seven Mexican Gray Wolves born in captivity. As of 2006, the zoo had two Mexican Gray Wolves in residence and continues to be one of the leading research and breeding facilities for Mexican Gray Wolves in the Southwestern United States. Alameda Park Zoo also has a bird of prey rehabilitation program. Each year the zoo receives a high number of injured and sick birds of prey. The zoo is devoted to healing and rehabilitating the birds, if well enough, the birds are then returned to the wild, if not, the birds are kept in the zoo for their own protection.

"Aliens and Economic Growth","New-Mexico","Aliens and Economic Growth"," Most think of one thing when Roswell, New Mexico is mentioned: aliens. So intense is the lore surrounding what is known as the 1947 Roswell Incident that much of the other highlights and history of city are completely overlooked. In 1891, the New Mexico Military Institute opened.  The school includes high school as well as a junior college. Many notable men have graduated from the institute including Sam Donaldson and Conrad Hilton. Many graduates have gone on to West Point . The early history of the city included thefts and murders by Apache Indians, and retribution for the same. One Roswell cattleman, John Chisum, was tired of having his horses stolen and his cattle hands murdered. He organized some citizens and staged the raid of an Apache camp where many stolen horses were recovered. This act helped to end the seemingly endless attacks by the Apaches . The Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, was stationed there and the city seemed to instantly decrease in size when half of the population departed after Walker Air Force base was closed in the 1970's . For all of its history and struggles, however, the 1947 event is what truly put Roswell on the map. In 1947, there had been a number of UFO sightings all over the country.  Then, in July, something came crashing to the ground in Roswell. A press release dated July 8, 1947 stated that debris from a disk had been recovered, but hours after it was released, that press release was replaced by one that said the debris that had been found was from a weather balloon. In the 50 plus years since the incident, many of the original eyewitnesses have come forward to try and shed light on what really happened that day. One such witness was Jesse Marcel, who was a major in the Air Force at the time of the incident.  In sharp contrast to the official story, Marcel said that the debris he recovered could not have been from a weather balloon or from any type of aircraft. He also said that there were strange characters etched into some of the metal debris that he found . While no one has been able to prove beyond a doubt that aliens crashed in Roswell that day, many believe that no one has been able to disprove it either. The popularity of the mystery surrounding the Roswell Incident has turned into a multi-million dollar tourism industry for Roswell. Roswell has many museums, most of which offer free admission, and an increasing retail presence in the downtown area of the city help to round out the city and assist in its continuing economic growth ."

"Aztec Ruins National Monument in New Mexico Highlights Pueblo History","New-Mexico","Aztec Ruins National Monument in New Mexico Highlights Pueblo History","	Located in northwestern New Mexico near the towns of Aztec and Farmington, Aztec Ruins National Monument preserves structures and other artifacts from the ancient Pueblo peoples of the 12th and 13th centuries. The name of the park is a misnomer. The structures found here were not built by members of the Aztec civilization but were built by the Anasazi (ancient Puebloans) of the nearby Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde regions. Located in the Animas Valley, just 75 miles from Four Corners U.S.A., this national monument region attracted ancient civilizations because of its fertile soil. Historians believe the structures here were used as a ceremonial and trade center throughout the 13th century. Dwindling resources and extreme weather probably forced the Pueblos to relocate sometime during the 1300s. European immigrants settled the Animas Valley in the 19th century and the ruins became well known. The first excavation was conducted in 1878, and in 1916, the American Museum of Natural History began further investigation of the area. Local archaeologist Earl Morris continued excavation for the next seven years and was responsible for excavating the major portion of what is referred to as the Western Ruins. He also became the first custodian of the Aztec Ruins National Monument when it was designated as such by the National Park Service in 1923. Currently, the park consists of 319 acres and only a small portion has been extensively excavated. Guests to the park may begin their tour of Aztec Ruins with a stop at the park's informative Visitor Center, which includes a large display of ancient excavated artifacts as well as a 25-minute video that educates visitors on the pre-Columbian history of the Four Corners area. Visitors may also follow a self-guided trail that allows them to explore up close the Puebloan great house'', which is known by park officials as the West Ruin. The .5-mile walk takes guests through various rooms in the house with the opportunity to view the skillful construction of the ancient civilization. This interpretive trail, much of which is accessible to wheelchairs, provides markers that offer information about particular landmarks. At the end of the trail, visitors can explore the Great Kiva, a 40-foot diameter subterranean structure that was used as a religious and social site for those who lived together here. This is the largest and oldest intact building of its kind. Rangers also hold occasional interpretive talks for visitors and other ranger-led activities include lectures and demonstrations of American Indian crafts. These are generally held during the summer months, when tourism is at its peak. Camping, lodging, food, and other amenities are not available inside the park but are accessible at the towns located just outside Aztec Ruins National Monument, including Aztec and Farmington."

"Bandalier National Monument in New Mexico is a Reminder of Times Past","New-Mexico","Bandalier National Monument in New Mexico is a Reminder of Times Past","	Located near Los Alamos, New Mexico, Bandalier National Monument is a 32,000 acre park that is home to hundreds of ruins of ancient Anasazi (Pueblo) cliff houses and pueblo-style dwellings that once belonged to the tribes that lived on the Pajarito Plateau. Bandalier has been a national monument since 1916, and in 1976, approximately 23,000 acres of the park were designated a protected wilderness area. The monument was named after Adolph Bandalier, an anthropologist who was a leading authority on the history of New Mexico and Arizona. Bandalier National Monument adjoins Valles Caldera National Preserve, which is situated to the north and west. The central focus of a visit to Bandalier National Monument is the exploration of Frijoles Canyon, an area of the park that contains pueblo homes, ceremonial buildings - called kivas, petroglyphs, and rock paintings. Some of the structures once sat on the canyon floor while others were built into the voids in the cliffs and are called cavates. Visitors can explore all of these dwellings with a trip around the 1.2-mile Main Loop Trail, which initiates at the Visitor Center and winds through excavated portions of Frijoles Canyon. Tours are self-guided and a portion of the trail is handicapped accessible. Off the Main Loop Trail, visitors can also follow the Falls Trail, a 5 mile trek that leads to the Rio Grande and to other trails inside the park. Another trail can be found at the Tsankawi portion of the national monument, which is separated from the main area by about 12 miles. This is the site of the ancestral Puebloan village of Tsankawi, which can be explored on a 1.5-mile hike which also takes visitors past more cavates and petroglyphs. This portion of the park is not handicapped accessible and exploration requires climbing ladders. If more hiking opportunities are desired, Bandalier National Monument offers more than 70 miles of backcountry trails, most of them located in the designated wilderness area. Some are appropriate for day journeys while others demand multi-day travels. Camping is permitted in the backcountry with the proper permit. There are also two additional campgrounds: Juniper, which is a family campground meant for small groups, and Ponderosa, for groups larger than 10. In the wintertime, cross country skiing and snow shoeing may also be enjoyed within the park in the Upper Frijoles Trail off Highway 4. Two trails for winter sports are open during daylight hours - one is 2.4 miles long and the other measures 5 miles long. The trail is usually snow covered from about mid-November to mid-March but there's not always enough snow for skiing. A picnic area is located near the Visitor Center and includes tables, bear-proof trash containers, and bathrooms. Also at the Visitors Center, guests can view ancient Pueblo pottery, tools, and artifacts and well as contemporary pieces crafted by members of the Pueblo tribe. Buildings and furniture built by FDR's Civilian Conservation Corps are also on display. An introductory film is available."

The area was lush with life 70 million years ago, leaving fossilized animal remains, petrified wood, hoodoo'' rock columns, and eerie spires of red sandstone for visitors to explore today. Photographers in particular appreciate the variety of incredible formations at Bisti. There are deeply eroded crevices, tall buttes, mushroom-like mounds, balancing rocks, canyons, dry washes, and other-worldly natural sculptures that are virtually impossible to describe. Hikers and backpackers will find this remote region lightly visited and largely absent of trails. It is open year-round for exploration via horseback or on foot, but mountain bikes and motorized vehicles are prohibited. Primitive camping is allowed. Visitors are advised to bring plenty of water and sunscreen or hats, as shaded areas are uncommon.

"Black Hole","New-Mexico","Black Hole - Los Alamos, New Mexico - Improbable Museum of Nuclear Waste","The Los Alamos Sales Company, better known as the Black Hole of Los Alamos, describes itself as An Unusual Place.'' It is part surplus store, part junkyard, and part museum with a focus on nuclear waste,'' the second most visited tourist attraction in Los Alamos after the Bradbury Museum. Gathered here and covering 17,000 square feet are used, salvaged, and recyclable supplies and materials, including oscilloscopes, galvanometers, Geiger counters, centrifuges and more, much of it purchased at auction from the Los Alamos Lab. Many items are for sale, but others are simply for show, photography, use in movies, or creating works of art. The Black Hole was the brainchild of a former Los Alamos National Laboratory machinist, Edward Atomic Ed'' Grothus (1923~2009). In 1980, he opened what would become an incredible five-acre collection of used scientific devices, electronics, laboratory supplies, nuclear by-products, government surplus items, and pre-owned test equipment. It gained its nickname because, as Grothus once put it, Everything goes in and nothing comes out.'' The Black Hole of Los Alamos is located at 4015 Arkansas Avenue Los Alamos, New Mexico 87544-1620. Operating hours are from 10am to 5pm on Tuesday through Saturday; closed on Sundays, Mondays, and national holidays."
"Black Mesa Golf Club","New-Mexico","Black Mesa Golf Club, La Mesilla, New Mexico ? a ``Wild Irish Links'' Course Set in New Mexico's High Desert","Black Mesa Golf Club has been described as having the look of a wild Irish links'' course to it, especially in the springtime when the native grasses are full and blowing in the wind. Set amid some dramatic sandstone ridges, the course plays through a sprawling valley that climbs toward distant mountains. The course, which opened in 2003, was designed by Robert Baxter Spann and plays at around 5,400 feet above sea level. Fairways on the 18-hole, par-72 course are framed by arroyos (dry gullies) and natural ridgelines, but also tend to be expansive, making the course play easier than it might initially appear. From the Black tees, the course plays to 7,307 yards, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 141 on Blue Grass fairways and Bentgrass greens. The layout features some distinctive bunkering, makes use of native arroyos as hazards, and offers expansive, undulating greens. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 1, which sets the tone for the round. This par-4 plays to only 339 yards from the Blue tees, but calls for a blind tee shot over a native ridge guarded by two bunkers to an undulating fairway. A ravine also guards the left side of the fairway, while approach shots play to a green guarded in front by some deep, intimidating bunkering. Hole No. 4 is the first of the course's dramatic par-3s. The hole is set amid a badlands'' area at the far southeast corner of the layout and plays to 174 yards from the Blue tees. What makes this hole so challenging is the green, which is tucked behind a native peak and surrounded by pot bunkers. Shots that miss the putting surface short and right will encounter a 14-foot-deep arroyo, while shots that miss long and right will find an even deeper ravine. Shots that miss left may find a mowed chipping area, while shots to the green will find a contoured putting surface with several subtle ridges and swales. Hole No. 12 is a fairly short par-4 that plays to only 377 yards from the Blue tees, while offering one of the most spectacular views on the course. The tee box is set upon a high ridge, in full view of Black Mesa and the surrounding landscape, and plays downhill to a fairway that features a large mound to contend with. Approach shots must then play uphill to an elevated and heavily bunkered green that features some bold breaks. Black Mesa Golf Club has received several honors and awards since its opening, including being ranked #35 of GOLF Magazine's list of Top 100 Courses You Can Play, and #11 on its Top Thrifty 50 list in 2006. Golfweek also ranked the course at #73 among its Top 100 Modern Courses list in 2008, while Golf Digest gave it Four Stars and named it one of the Best New Affordable Public Courses in 2003. Practice facilities at Black Mesa include a spacious practice range with 60,000 square feet of teeing area and seven target greens. There are also two practice putting greens, including a serpentine'' green. Golf instruction is also available. The course also offers a clubhouse which is home to the Mesa Grill for casual dining and drinks. Stay & Play packages are also available in conjunction with several area hotels."
"Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge - Socorro, New Mexico Sanctuary for Migrating Birds","New-Mexico","Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge - Socorro, New Mexico Sanctuary for Migrating Birds","In Spanish, Bosque del Apache means woods of the Apache,'' a reference to Native American tribes that once camped here in the forest along the Rio Grande. Seven centuries ago, the area was home to Piro Indians, pueblo dwellers who farmed the valley, raised turkeys, gathered fruit, and hunted wildlife. Today, the 57,191 acres of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge provide sanctuary for tens of thousands of migratory birds that journey down from the north each autumn. Familiar species seen here include sandhill cranes, geese, and ducks. They blanket the feeding areas by day and roost in the marshes by night. Occasionally bald eagles can be seen in winter. Warblers, flycatchers, and shorebirds are common in the spring and fall, while songbirds and waders are plentiful during the summer months. The Bosque del Apache also has year-round avian residents, such as turkey, quail, pheasant, and roadrunners. And there are numerous mammals in the Refuge, too - muskrats, porcupines, mule deer, and coyote. To get to Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge from Socorro, New Mexico, head south on Interstate 25. Take Exit 139 toward San Antonio and follow Route 380 for a half mile to Old Highway 1. The Visitors Center is nine miles further on, open Monday through Friday from 7:30am to 4pm and on weekends from 8am to 4:30pm. Driving the loop tour around the Refuge is possible from one hour before sunrise until an hour after sunset."
"Bottomless Pit","New-Mexico","Bottomless Pit - Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico - Deep Hole Inside a Huge Hole","Tours through Carlsbad Caverns typically start with the Big Room, a massive underground chamber than includes the world's largest stalagmite, hundred-foot high ceilings, and stalactites that resemble chandeliers. One of the most popular features of the Big Room is a deep rift in the limestone floor that seems to extend downward without limit - the so-called Bottomless Pit.'' Originally, the pit was really thought to be bottomless. When stones were tossed into it, no sound was ever heard of them striking the bottom. Later explorations revealed the truth. The bottom was deep, about 140 feet below the opening, and covered with loose soil. When the stones reached the bottom, the sound of their landing was muffled by the soft dirt. Still, visitors love to put the pit to the test. As a result, park rangers have to rappel to the bottom once a year to retrieve all the trash that's been thrown in. Another interesting aspect of the Bottomless Pit is the large amount of gypsum around it. The soft white mineral attests to how the chamber and pit were formed. When sulfuric acid combines with limestone and water, it releases carbon dioxide and water, leaving gypsum deposits as a byproduct. Over the course of 250 million years, rainwater seeping down through cracks in the ground and sulfurous gases rising up from the Earth's depths gradually dissolved the soft limestone to create these amazing formations."

"Budville Trading Post","New-Mexico","Budville Trading Post - Grants, New Mexico - Abandoned Landmark on Route 66","The Budville Trading Post is arguably one of the most photographed landmarks on Route 66 as it passes through New Mexico. Located about thirty feet from the highway's shoulder, it is an abandoned, one-story, white-washed cement-block building featuring a low angled roof. There is a large, non-functioning neon sign, Budville Trading Company,'' mounted above it on two 12-foot iron posts, one of them sunk into the former island for Phillips 66 fuel pumps. The unassuming gas stop would be of little interest if it were not for Bud Rice, son of the original owner and the man for whom the town of Budville was named. Rice not only operated a small grocery store, pawn shop, gas station, wrecker service, salvage yard, and repair garage from here; he also sold bus tickets, owned the local State Motor Vehicle Department concession, and was elected as a local Justice of the Peace. In 1967, Rice was murdered during a hold-up. The criminals were never caught. For a dozen years after, Bud's wife Flossie kept the trading post going. But it closed in 1979 and an attempt to re-open it as a general store in 2006 failed. Today, the Budville Trading Post, established in 1928, serves as a fascinating reminder of one of the larger-than-life legends of America's most famous highway."
"Canyon Road features many art studios and workshops","New-Mexico","Canyon Road features many art studios and workshops","Canyon Road is located in Santa Fe and is the old trade route from Pecos; there are many art studios and workshops located along the road, which are open to the public to attend. The area is rich in history and is part of the cultural center of Santa Fe. The road has many gracious homes along the winding, shaded streets of the road, and a special quality from the history of small farms that are scattered along the road, which used to be an old Indian trail. Many artists have visited Santa Fe since the 1880s. The natural scenic beauty of the area and the old Spanish villages provided subjects for painting and sculpture. The first artist to reside on the road was Gerald Cassidy who was familiar with the Native people of northern New Mexico; he was a painter of landscapes, Native American genre scenes and portraits of the Natives. Tours available along the road include visiting the many Spanish and Territorial Era houses. These houses include the house of Rafael and Joseph Garcia who purchased a property in 1848, which was remodeled in the 1950s and the home of Juan Jose Prada, which was built in 1768, then enlarged in the mid-nineteenth century to contain 19 rooms and a courtyard garden. The Galleries along Canyon Road include galleries featuring Native American Art, Contemporary, Historic, sculpture and gardens. The 19th and 20th Century Galleries include Mark Sublette Medicine Man gallery and Marc Navarro Gallery. Contemporary Representational Art Galleries include Alexandra Stevens and Art Exchange Gallery. Contemporary Abstract and Expressionist Art include Adieb Khadoure and Bellas Artes. The other types of galleries are Native American Art, Folk and Tribal Art, Contemporary Glass, Ceramic and Fiber Arts, Jewelry, Clothing, Furniture and Interiors, Photography and Books. Canyon Road has been the art gallery district where artist and art lovers have been visiting in Santa Fe for over a century.

There are over 100 galleries, studios, specialty shops; restaurants and historic areas, which give a southwestern charm. Tours of Canyon Road are available through many tour operators in New Mexico."
"Capulin Volcano National Monument in New Mexico Provides Insight on Geologic History of the Area","New-Mexico","Capulin Volcano National Monument in New Mexico Provides Insight on Geologic History of the Area","	Capulin Volcano National Monument is located in northeastern New Mexico near the town of Raton. Designated a national monument in 1916, it contains a portion of the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field, in particular a prime example of an extinct cinder cone volcano known as Capulin. Cinder cone volcanoes are made almost entirely of loose fragments of rock, including lava, signaling the fact that this is a young volcano that was formed during the last stage of volcanism that had started more than 8 million years ago. Scientists believe Capulin Volcano is only about 62,000 years old. The volcano, the main attraction of this national monument, rises about 1,300 feet above the plains to about 8,200 feet above sea level. Geologists explain that the symmetry of Capulin Mountain Volcano was preserved because lava did not flow from the main crater but from secondary vents located at the western base of the cone. It is unlikely that it will even erupt again, they say, so it's more than safe to visit and the area attracts a few hundred thousand visitors each year who are eager to explore the volcano and learn about the history of the area. There are two ways to explore the cinder cone at Capulin Volcano National Monument. Visitors may follow the winding road around the volcano's rim in their automobiles and stop to admire views from the top. However, each year, many guests choose to hike the volcano itself. Two self-guided trails begin at the summit of the volcano. The shorter of the two, a .2-mile hike on the Crater Vent Trail, heads straight to the bottom of the crater to the vent and allows a look at the inside of a volcanic mountain. The longer trail, which measures 1 mile in distance, winds around the rim of Capulin Mountain but does not descend to the volcano floor. It does, however, involve steep climbs. Nonetheless, this moderately difficult Crater Rim Trail provides excellent views of the area and plenty of photo opportunities. The most strenuous trail at Capulin Volcano National Monument is the Boca Trail, an unimproved 2-mile loop that takes visitors to the Boca area, the vent from which the flows originated. This strenuous trail provides a look at many geologic features unique to the area. In addition, the handicapped-accessible Nature Trail takes visitors along a paved eight-sided path through some of the natural areas around the volcano, allowing a look at local flora. Rangers are available along most of the trails to answer questions but the park does not offer guided hikes. The park rangers, however, do offer talks twice daily which can be helpful in interpreting what is viewed along the trails. An onsite Visitor Center offers a 10-minute video as well as several displays about the geology, natural history, and culture of this portion of New Mexico."

It is the home of a gigantic white stalagmite that can be reached only via special ranger-guided tours. Those who would like to see the White Giant formation close up need to come prepared for a strenuous, challenging journey. It is necessary to crawl long distances through tight passageways and climb up slippery flowstone to reach the hall. A few portions of the passage have ladders to climb, while others require some free climbing ability. One narrow segment called Matlock's Pinch has a name especially well deserved. Long pants and hiking boots or other sturdy shoes are required to make the trip, which can last up to four hours. The park will provide visitors with hardhats and headlamps, but participants are advised to bring along their own knee pads, gloves, and four AA batteries. This tour is not for those afraid of tight spaces or heights. Groups depart every Saturday at 1pm from the underground lunchroom, and the cost is $20 for adults and $10 for children, who must be aged 12 or above. Advance reservations are required."

The original building was constructed as the home of the Gutiyrrez family and passed down for generations. In 1952, the property was sold to Alan and Shirley Minge, who turned the house into a repository for their growing collection of scarce Hispanic New Mexican artifacts.

The ruins here reveal some 500 rooms and 12 ceremonial kivas surrounding a great kiva in the village's central courtyard. There was also an elevated plaza that stood a dozen feet above the valley floor, and ancient stairways were carved into the cliffs behind, leading to prehistoric roadways. The rear wall of Chetro Ketl reached a length of almost 500 feet and contained rooms stacked five stories high. Lower rooms were used for storage, while the terraced upper ones were for residence. The walls were supported by wooden beams called vigas,'' some of which were up to 26 inches thick. Estimates put the number of trees cut down to build Chetro Ketl at more than 5,000. The structure was most likely abandoned around 1120 AD.

"Corrales Bosque","New-Mexico","Corrales Bosque - Albuquerque, New Mexico - Dying Cottonwoods and Bike Trails","Along the Rio Grande River in New Mexico, the marshy banks are frequently lined with stands of native cottonwood. These tracts are called bosque, the Spanish word for woods. Near the intersection of Alameda Boulevard and Corrales Road in Albuquerque, is one such area called the Corrales Bosque. This bosque has long been enjoyed by hikers, dog walkers, horseback riders, and bird watchers. It has been home to migrating ducks and geese, host to tamarisk and Russian olive, and a preserve of native wild flowers. Longtime residents think of it as a narrow strip of greenery snaking through the desert and a sanctuary from the surrounding world of asphalt, steel and glass. However, the deciduous cottonwood trees in Corrales Bosque are dying. Some sections have been bull-dozed to remove the dry brush, felled branches, and deadwood that pose a fire hazard. New trees are needed to replace the passing generation, but attempts have failed. Planted seedlings are not surviving. The future of Corrales Bosque is in question. In the meantime, mountain bikers have discovered its stretches of barren dirt. They rave about the winding paths and side trails. The main route that passes through Corrales Bosque is a 15-mile loop, graded as intermediate for off-road cycling - which may soon be the only form of recreation remaining here."

Rain water seeping into the cave has frozen over many centuries, and the rock walls provide such good insulation that the ice never melts. Today, the cave floor is 20 feet thick with frozen water, the oldest of which dates back to 1000 BC. Layers of algae growing beneath the surface create an eerie blue-green glow when struck by sunlight. The walls of the cave are covered with ice up to 12 feet high, and temperatures in the chilly chamber never exceed 31 degrees. Early settlers in the region used to come to the Desert Ice Box to bring home chunks of the ice in wagons loaded with sawdust. For a while, a local tavern near the cavern served up ice-cold beer, chilled inside the frosty formation.

The name El Malpais is Spanish in origin and literally means the badlands. The area is composed of two wilderness areas: the West Malpais and the Cebolla area. The attraction was embraced in 1987 as being a meaningful place of natural scenic history and has been recently preserved by the National Park System. The El Malpais National Monument covers over 114,000 acres of land, most of which is owned by the federal government. The area is so large that most visitors stop at ranger stations to pick up maps, literature, and other helpful information. Visitors to the park are encouraged to wear sturdy hiking boots, pack water and gear for inclement weather, and ensure that a day pack with first aid, sunscreen, and snacks are also available. The monument is estimated to be between 2000-3000 years old but the area's exact age is unknown. The park is used to educate the public about natural history, volcanoes, geology, and geography. Each area of the land has been researched by scientists and archeologist over the years. Researchers are still unraveling all that the El Malpais National Monument has to offer the world. Some of the volcanic remnants that can be found at the monument include lava flows, pressure ridges, cinder cones, and tube systems which almost dominate the landscape of the area. Scientists and ecologists who frequent El Malpais are interested in the complex relationships shared by multiple ecosystems within the conservation area. The El Malpais National Monument ranges in elevation and starts at 6500 feet with its highest point being 8300 feet. A scenic overlook from the high point is located on the east side of El Malpais. The natural terrain in El Malpais is substantially rocky making it difficult for natural trails to be furnished throughout the area. Some of the other attractions in the area include a 17 mile-long tube structure, natural arches of sandstone, deep caves, and the Anasazi Ruins. El Malpais National Monument is protected by the Conservation society and the federal government. Visitors to the area are not allowed to move any artifacts, plants, or animals and any hunting or trapping done in the conservation requires a state license. Local contemporary Native American groups still play a prominent role in the conservation area. Different tribes such as the Puebloan peoples of Acoma, Ramah Navajo, Laguna, and Zuni tribes all visit the area to gather herbs, pay respects to the place that was once inhabited by their ancestors, and renew bonds. The ancestral ties that various Native American groups have with the El Malpais National Monument are of great interest to anthropologists. The monument is consistently open to the public with the exception of major holidays. Visitors to the El Malpais National Monument that want additional information before touring the conservation area can attend the El Malpais Information Center.

"El Morro National Monument New Mexico","New-Mexico","El Morro National Monument New Mexico","El Morro National Monument is located in the west portion of New Mexico and is one of the state's most beautiful geographical areas. Visitors from all over the world come to El Morro National Monument to see the evidence in a large rock commonly referred to as the Inscription Rock. The rock has been a part of the monument for seven hundred years. Over the centuries, travelers to the monument left their signatures and stories in the rock and although time has faded much of the insignia, many writings can still be seen today. Some of the inscriptions in the rock were left by former governors and generals. Federal law prohibited any further carving in 1906. The word El Morro is spanish and means the headland. El Morro or the headland is named for its high point, which sits at 7,219 feet above sea level. One of the most interesting spots is on top of El Morro. At the top stands a grand pueblo of 875 rooms that was built in the late 13th century. The settlers of the pueblo didn't stay in the area long, only for a couple of generations before leaving but artifacts of their existence can still be found in the ancient pueblo today. The writings the people left behind on the walls of the pueblo are called petroglyphs, which are drawn outlines of human hands, bear tracks, and other symbols on sandstone wall. Later, the area was used by Europeans as both a landmark and a source of clean water. At the summit of El Morro, rain and melted snow drip into a basin located at the foot of the cliff. The summit and basin created a dependable supply of water for both animals and people in the area. Visitors to El Morro are encouraged to attend the monument during the summer moths when Ranger-led programs are open to the public. Some of the programs offer cave tours, guided hikes, and even a viewing of the bat flights. Rangers can take visitors along a 1/2 mile loop trail that leads past hundreds of petroglyphs and a historic pool. A more strenuous two-mile hike is available for visitors who want to visit the top and gain a view of the box canyon. Summers are a better time to visit the monument because of the cold, wind, and snow that is prevalent during the winter months. El Morro isn't too far from El Malpais National Monument and most tourists attend both monuments for a complete geographical experience. Children are encouraged to participate in the educational aspects that El Morrro has to offer. In the front of the visitor center an Inscription Rock is available for children to write their own stories and signatures on. The monument has a Junior Ranger program that gives children various activities to partake in while on the trails. The Information Center also provides a fifteen minute film that gives an introduction to the monument as well as exhibits that can be explored prior to setting out on the trails. Historians and researchers are drawn to El Morro due to the large number of inscription stories, petroglyphs and remains on the pueblo. A great battle is said to have taken place at the area in the late 1600's and much more recorded history that has occurred at the monument is constantly being discovered."

"Enchanted Circle Pottery","New-Mexico","Enchanted Circle Pottery - Taos, New Mexico - Ceramic Art with a Japanese Flair","Enchanted Circle Pottery is owned and operated by two New Mexico artists, Kevin and JoAnne DeKeuster. Their award-winning ceramics can be seen in their studio/gallery, roughly fourteen miles outside Taos en route to Angel Fire in the region known as Enchanted Circle. The DeKeusters both work in clay and fire their pieces only with wood. This is an ancient Japanese process of making pottery. It gives their artwork unique iridescent colors, as wood ash in the kiln lands on the ceramic pieces and melts into the glaze finish at temperatures reaching 2,400 degrees. The couple was first introduced to wood-fired pottery at Northern Arizona University, while working on their masters degrees. They later studied the art in Japan.

"Fajada Butte","New-Mexico","Fajada Butte - Nageezi, New Mexico - Celestial Outlook in Chaco Canyon","One of the most photographed geological formations in Chaco Culture National Historical Park is Fajada Butte. This 380-feet-foot-high remnant of a larger mesa dominates the landscape. Rising from the surrounding valley floor to an elevation of 6,623 feet, the butte is the only object within the two-mile wide gap between Chaco Canyon's East Mesa and Chacra Mesa walls. Fajada means banded'' in Spanish, a reference to the butte's rising layers of cliffs. There is evidence that the local Anasazi once created a 750-foot ramp to reach this celestial viewing location, but it eroded away centuries ago. The ruins of about two dozen dwellings have been found in the higher cliff bands, which can be reached now only with rock-climbing gear or via a steep 40-foot chimney'' cutting through sandstone rock. Among Fajada Butte's features are three slabs of sandstone called the Sun Dagger, located at the foot of the uppermost band. Estimated to weight about 4? tons, they measure 6~10 feet high and about three feet wide, from 8 to 20 inches thick. Chacoan astronomers etched spiral petroglyphs in their surfaces to track cycles of the sun and moon, including solstices and equinoxes. Access to Fajada Butte has been restricted since 1982, owing to damage to the Sun Dagger by climbers and foot traffic. However, visitors can view the butte clearly from across a stretch of desert from Una Vida, which can be reached via a half-mile trail that begins at the northeast corner of the parking lot near the park's visitor center."

Ailman, an immigrant who happened upon the amazing formation in the summer of 1878. Since the Gila Cliff Dwellings were first discovered, millions of visitors have come to the old ruins anxious to study the dwellings and figure out the role that they have played in New Mexico's history. The Gila Cliff Dwellings covers 533 acres of land and was designated as a national monument by the President himself, Theodore Roosevelt in 1907. The government later passed an executive order called the Antiquities Act to prevent the further removal of artifacts in the dwellings by hunters and tourists. The dwellings are located in the Southern part of Catron County, with the closest city being Silver City. Scientists believe that the Cliff itself was created by some type of volcanic activity. Inside the cliff are interlinked caves that were once inhabited by people of the Mongollon culture. Archaeologists believe the Mongollons lived in the cliffs in 1300 AD. About ten to fifteen families are estimated to have lived in the cliffs but the reason for their departure remains unknown. One of the most interesting things that have been found in the Gila Cliff Dwellings are mummified bodies.

"Green Lake","New-Mexico","Green Lake - Carlsbad Caverns National Park, New Mexico - Scenic Green Underground Chamber","The Green Lake Room is one of many highly decorated scenic chambers within the complex of 84 major caves at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Unlike the many rooms noted for their stalagmites and stalactites, the specific highlight of this chamber is a green-hued pool of water located in a corner of its uppermost floor. It was first believed that the green color of this lake'' was caused by microbes or an algae-like film beneath its surface. However, later investigation showed that the color of Green Lake comes from a carbonate mineral lining its sides and bottom: Malachite. Also known as copper carbonate,'' the green-colored mineral crystallizes to form stalagmitic masses. As light shines through the water, it reflects the malachite's deep green color. In the late 1940s, the U.S. military undertook a series of tests at Green Lake to evaluate its feasibility for use as an emergency fallout shelter. During an atomic test at a distant facility, no ripples were observed on the surface of the water here, leading officials to believe the Green Lake Room would be a safe haven in the event of nuclear attack. Green Lake is featured on two tour routes at Carlsbad Caverns. The self-guided tour starting at the Natural Entrance leads 1?-mile past the Green Lake Overlook, while the mile-long King's Palace Guided Tour takes a paved trail right through the chamber.

"Hunziker Bowl","New-Mexico","Hunziker Bowl - Taos, New Mexico - Lift-Less Skiing at Taos Ski Valley","Hunziker Bowl is a popular ski area within Taos Ski Valley. It was named in honor of a Swiss-born engineer, Paul Hunziker, who helped design the first ski lift up 12,481-foot Kachina Peak. Hunziker died in an airplane accident in 1971 while the lift was still being installed. He was reportedly en route to inspect his work when his plane went down. Ironically, the Hunziker Bowl itself, which is on the backside of the Kachina Basin, has no lift of its own. From the base area at 9,400 feet above sea level, it only takes a couple of minutes to hike the short uphill trail leading to its slopes at an elevation of 9,540 feet. Many skiers are put off by the climb, which means plenty of fresh powder often awaits those willing to put in the extra effort. The run down Hunziker Bowl has been described as challenging and fun, a more mellow cruise'' in comparison to the legendary steep chutes of Kachina Peak. Operating hours are from 9am to 4pm while the ski patrol is on duty, from mid-December through early April. Ski rentals, restrooms and lockers are available at the Taos Ski Valley Resort Center."

"Inn of the Mountain Gods Golf Course","New-Mexico","Inn of the Mountain Gods Golf Course, Mescalero, New Mexico - A Mountain Golf Course That Plays Long and Hard","The Inn of the Mountain Gods Golf Course is set at an elevation of approximately 7,200 feet above sea level, amid a canyon of tall pine trees and foothills beneath the Sierra Blanca Peak. A Ted Robinson design, the course features wide-open fairways that tend to narrow as golfers approach the greens, where trouble is most likely to be found. The course also features rolling terrain and several water hazards come into play throughout the layout. There's even an island fairway, and pinyou, cottonwood, aspen and pine trees border the course and also come into play. Golfers should also not be surprised to encounter deer or elk crossing the fairways. The front nine is the more narrow and features a number of forced carries over water, while the back nine features one of the best holes in the state - the par-5 No. 14. The greens are said to be both beautiful and fast-breaking,'' and players are asked to remember that the primary slope is always away from the overlooking mountain. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 1975, plays to 6,834 from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 72.1 and a slope rating of 132 on Blue grass fairways and Bent grass greens. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 10, one of the most unique par-4s golfers are likely to encounter. Most island'' holes tend to be of the par-3 variety, but the island on this hole is its fairway, which is quite literally a round landing area surrounded by water. Another noteworthy hole is No. 14, a par-5 that has been acclaimed as one of the best holes in the state. This long hole is fairly straightforward and level, but it's the tight, tree-lined fairways and large, solitary trees on the fairway that will make it a challenge for most golfers. Inn of the Gods has received a number of accolades over the years, including being featured in GOLF Magazine as a Top-35 golf course, while Travel and Leisure magazine named it the most underrated golf course in the Southwest.''

Padre Antonio Martinez, the eldest son, became famous as a social reformer, opening New Mexico's first co-educational school.

There are also croplands, wetlands, marshes, ponds, streams, lakes, and riparian regions. Today, the Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge is home to more than 270 bird species, some 80 of which use this as their nesting ground. Other wildlife found here includes mule deer, American pronghorn, wild turkey, and coyote. There are many amphibians, reptiles, and insects, too. The Las Vegas National Wildlife Refuge is located to the southeast of Las Vegas, New Mexico about seven miles.

"Paa-Ko Ridge Golf Club","New-Mexico","Paa-Ko Ridge Golf Club, Sandia Park, New Mexico - An Upscale 27-Hole Golf Course in the New Mexico High Desert","Paa-Ko Ridge Golf Club is set upon the east side of the Sandia Mountains at elevations ranging from 6.500 to 7,000 feet above sea level. The club offers 27 holes of golf on a layout that includes many of the elements common to the New Mexico high desert, such as rock outcroppings, native vegetation, arroyos (gullies that are usually dry except after a heavy rainfall), mountainous terrain, and spectacular views. Many of the holes play uphill or downhill through a mixture of juniper, ponderosa and pinon pine trees. The par-72 course, which opened in 2000, is the design of Ken Dye, and all three combinations play to more than 7,500 yards from the Tournament tees, and more than 7,000 yards from the Championship (Blue) tees. From the Blue tees, the USGA rating is 73.1 with a slope rating of 134 on Kentucky Bluegrass tees and fairways with L93 Bentgrass greens. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the course include Hole No. 4 on the First Nine. The name of this hole is Dye-abolical,'' and it's an interesting and challenging par-3. The hole plays to 166 yards from the Blue tees to the largest green in the state at 100 yards deep. The putting surface also features an elevation change of 13 feet from its lowest to highest point, which can make distance control off the tee and putting a serious challenge on this hole. Hole No. 5 on the Second Nine is another par-3 and one of the more challenging on the course. The hole plays to a hefty 243 yards from the Blue tees, and 219 from the Green (equates to White) tees. The hole plays downhill, however, to a crested, sloping green surrounded by bunkers and native areas that are closer than they appear. Another challenging hole is No. 3 (No. 21 overall) on the Third Nine. Named Wreckage'' in honor of the plane wreckage that's found on-site, this par-4 plays to 424 yards from the Blue tees, but also plays uphill, making it even longer and more difficult than its posted yardage. There's also a deep bunker short and right of the green to add to the challenge. The Muirfield'' is Hole No. 5 on the Third Nine (No. 23 overall) and is a lengthy par-5 that plays to 625 yards from the longest tees and 607 yards from the Blues. Like its namesake in Scotland, which has hosted the British Open many times, this hole plays uphill and features numerous bunkers, making it one of the most difficult and demanding holes on the course. Since opening, Paa-Ko Ridge has received a number of honors and awards. In 2000, Golf Digest named it the #1 Best New Course in America, GOLF Magazine ranked it among the Top 10 New Courses You Can Play in America, and Golfweek listed it at #23 among the Top 100 Modern Courses in the country. Practice facilities at the club include a driving range, putting and chipping greens and a practice bunker. Golf instruction and club fitting are also available.

"Pecos River Flume","New-Mexico","Pecos River Flume - Carlsbad, New Mexico - Where a River Crosses Over Itself","The Pecos River Flume is an aqueduct over the Pecos River in Carlsbad, New Mexico. It was originally constructed of wood in 1890 as part of the Southern Main Canal to carry irrigation water to dry areas from Lake Avalon. Pecos River-originated water flows through the flume, which once led Ripley's Believe It or Not'' to feature it as the world's only river that crosses itself.'' In 1902, a flood destroyed the original structure, which was 475 feet long by 25 feet wide and carried up to eight feet of water. It was replaced in 1903 with a four-span, closed-spandrel concrete arch. Upon its completion, the new aqueduct ranked briefly as the largest concrete structure in the world. Even to this day, the Pecos River Flume provides water to the Carlsbad Irrigation System, directing much needed resources to local farmlands. It is not always in use, however, and sometimes holds only standing water. There are no signs posted or fences to keep anyone from climbing to the top, but most visitors are content to take photographs of the flume from a distance. The Pecos River Flume is located off Callaway Drive on Westridge Drive. It is about one block northeast of U.S. Highway 285 near the Comfort Inn. Parking is possible, but not advisable, beneath the fume. Leaking water has been known to rain down on cars below."
"Petroglyph National Monument New Mexico","New-Mexico","Petroglyph National Monument New Mexico","Petroglyph National Monument is famous for the petroglyphs that can be seen for seventeen miles along the West Mesa escarpment in Albuquerque. Petroglyphs are images that are carved on rocks. The images are created by constant pecking or carving on the rock. The national monument is located on 11 square miles that are divided into three distinct units. The units are called the Rinconada Canyon, Boca Negra, and the Piedras Marcadas unit. The Boca Negra unit is equipped with numerous self-guided trails that visitors can use to explore the area on their own. The petroglyphs that are found in the monument are believed to have been created by historic Native Americans and Hispanics. The site holds valuable historic insights that reveal a 12,000 year old story of what human life was like in ancient times. Researchers estimate that many of the petroglyphs were created between the 12th and 15th century. The park is named after the petroglyphs that were discovered by explorers and is one of New Mexico's greatest historical monuments. Many archeologists and historians frequent the site because Petroglyph National Monument is home to the most impressive collection of Hispanic and Indian art in the world. Many of the petroglyphs are complex and contemporarily used by today's Pueblo Indians. An estimated 25,000 petroglyphs can be seen throughout the monument. There are no camping facilities available on the monument site, but there are a variety of hotels and motels that tourists can stay in near the vicinity.

A Ken Dye design, the championship-caliber course was immediately recognized at its opening in 1989 as one of the best new desert golf courses in the nation, and was even acclaimed by Golf Digest in 2002 as the #1 municipal golf course in the country. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,249 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.3 and a slope rating of 140, but a much more manageable 6,240 yards from the Middle (White) tees on Rye grass. The high-desert atmosphere also helps the ball travel farther than at sea level, lessening the course's length. The layout features a number of Dye trademarks in its design, including modern golf course architecture elements such as large, terraced greens, yawning grass bunkers and sculptured, winding fairways. Other Dye design elements include mounding, collection caverns, and heavily contoured, elevated greens that punish missed approach shots with deep bunkers or depressions. At its core, Pinon Hills is a desert course and sandstone formations, mesas (broad, flat-topped elevation with sheer sides), scenic arroyos (dry gullies) and the area's native, gnarled pinons and junipers give the course a wild west'' look. There are also sandstone canyons to be traversed, lovely ponds and exposed rocks to be found. Since its opening, the course has undergone some changes, including switching the front and back nines. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the revamped layout include Hole No. 6. This hole is said to be a gem,'' and is also one of the most-photographed on the course. A long par-3, the hole plays to 228 yards and sits in its own canyon, surrounded by rugged boulders, sandstone heights and a sand wash that snakes along the left side. Tee shots take aim at a heart-shaped green, backed by more boulders and rocky pinnacles that will have golf balls bouncing like crazy on shots that go long. No. 8 was formerly Hole No. 17, and is a long par-5 that plays to 540 yards. The hole doglegs left and calls for a straight drive off the tee to avoid the grass bunkers on the right corner. Shots that go left will find trouble in the trees, while second shots take aim at a generous landing area. From there, approach shots must reach what's been called a treacherous'' green flanked by sand on the left. Pinon Hills has been accorded many accolades over the years, and has been almost legendary for its affordable excellence. In the late 1990s, when the course could be played for as little as $11, it was called by some the best golf course in the world for a dirt-cheap price.'' Those prices are long gone, but the course has still been ranked as high as No. 8 on the list of 50 Best Courses for Under $50. Practice facilities at Pinon Hills including a practice range, and putting and chipping greens. Lessons are also available, as well as a Pro Shop with custom club fitting and club rental.

The Plaza Blanca's unusual landscape invites contemplation. To many, the towering white stone pillars and gnome-like hoodoos feel almost spiritual in nature.

She believes it has transformational power, a place to heal physical, emotional and spiritual pain.'' Getting to the surrealistic cliffs and columns of Plaza Blanca requires some good hiking shoes.

"Pueblo de Cochiti Golf Course","New-Mexico","Pueblo de Cochiti Golf Course, Cochiti Lake, New Mexico - A Golf Course Dubbed by Locals as ``Heaven With a Zip Code''","Pueblo de Cochiti Golf Course lies amid the foothills of the Jemez Mountains, about 30 minutes southwest of Santa Fe, on part of 53,779 acres of reservation land. The course, which opened in 1981 and is the design of Robert Trent Jones, Jr., has been dubbed by local residents as Heaven with a zip code'' in reference to the natural beauty and breathtaking views of the New Mexico high desert. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays in the mountains of New Mexico in the range of 5,300 to 6,800 feet above sea level. The course is considered a medium-length layout, playing to only 6,817 yards from the longest, Championship tees and, at that length, the course has a USGA rating of 71 and a slope rating of 132. In 2000, Jones was asked to update and renovate the already award-winning course, including new tee boxes, bunker work, lake renovations, cart paths, and a new irrigation system. The course is considered a challenging mountain/desert course, with narrow fairways lined with trees and shrubs, bunkers on every hole, and three water holes adding to the challenge. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 4, a par-3 water hole that plays to 185 yards from the longest tees. This hole plays over and around a large pond on the left to a green that's guarded by a large bunker at the back left. Adding to the challenge and club selection, the hole typically plays into a prevailing wind. Hole No. 9 is the most difficult hole on the front nine, and the #2-handicap hole on the course. This par-4 plays from an elevated tee box that offers some picturesque views, to a fairway that narrows to a dramatic bottleneck guarded by bunkers on both sides and a water hazard farther right. Hole No. 14 is the most difficult on the course, a par-4 that plays to 440 yards from the back tees. As with the No. 9 hole, the difficulty arises from a fairway that pinches in dramatically at about the halfway point and is guarded left and right by fairway bunkers. Approach shots must then find a small undulating green guarded by three more bunkers. Since its renovation in 2000, Pueblo de Cochiti has received a number of awards, including a 4-Star rating from Golf Digest and a place among America's Top 75 Affordable Courses, along with a listing on Golf Week's America's Best Courses You Can Play List.

"San Felipe de Neri Church","New-Mexico","San Felipe de Neri Church - Albuquerque, New Mexico - The City's Oldest Catholic Parish","Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the current church known as San Felipe de Neri was built in 1793. The parish by the name, however, dates back more than 300 years. It was established in 1706, when a Franciscan priest, Fray Manuel Moreno, came to Albuquerque along with 30 Catholic families from Bernalillo. Today, San Felipe de Neri Church is staffed by priests and deacons from the Archdiocese of Santa Fe. The building contains a parish museum of furnishings and religious art that have found a home in the church over the centuries.

"San Miguel Mission","New-Mexico","San Miguel Mission, Santa Fe, NM","Visiting Santa Fe usually means history, culture, and numerous art galleries will be on the list of things to do. For those looking to plan their leisure or business travel the Mission of San Miguel in Santa Fe, New Mexico is one site that should be on the list. The mission is the epitome of colonial Catholicism in the USA. The mission is still being used for Catholic masses, which brings about the history and melding of cultures one can find within the adobe walls. The church was built in 1610 with high windows and an altar screen. The screen was erected in 1798 offering more than just an amazing architectural feature, but also something one does not often see from history. There is a 780 pound San Jose bell which is located inside the church. The bell was cast in Spain in 1356 and later moved to Santa Fe. Among the other items to see at the church are the buffalo hide and deerskin Bible paintings. These things were used in Franciscan missionaries in the 1630s to teach Native Americans. Since the mission is of historical and archeological value, anthropologists have studied it. They even excavated near the altar to find the floor built in 1610. The floor was said to be from a 12th century pueblo. There is a small store near the sanctuary that sells religious artifacts and a few souvenirs to help visitors remember their trip. The San Miguel Mission is located on 401 Old Santa Fe Trail at East De Vargas Street. The mission is open Monday through Saturday from 9am to 5pm. On Sunday the church is open 9am to 4pm. The summer hours will allow the church to open a bit earlier for tours and mass. The last mass on Sunday is at 5pm. For those wishing to tour the mission but not stay for mass an admission of $1 for adults is required. Children six and under are free. The donation goes towards upkeep of the church, as well as an appreciation for the tour one receives while visiting. To access the mission one must go from the Loretto Chapel along the Santa Fe Trail which also crosses the river. The Santa Fe Trail has been extremely important to residents of Santa Fe. It allowed settlers to move into the area. It also makes sense to have the mission founded on the trail that was so imperative to early settler history. The walls of the mission are immense with massive carved beams called vigas. They were used to support the roof of the adobe construction. There are also corbel arches that define the mission's architecture. The bell tower still stands, but as mentioned the bell is no longer in the tower. It was brought down to help preserve the tower due to its weight. It also allows visitors to see the old bell. There are four sub floors in the mission though they are not part of the tour."
"Santa Ana Golf Club, Tamaya/Cheena Course, Bernalillo, New Mexico ? a True, Links-Style Golf Course Set Amid the New Mexico Desert","New-Mexico","Santa Ana Golf Club, Tamaya/Cheena Course, Bernalillo, New Mexico ? a True, Links-Style Golf Course Set Amid the New Mexico Desert","Santa Ana is a true links-style golf course, set amid the New Mexico desert along the Rio Grande River, surrounded by the Jemez Mountains to the west, the Sandia Mountains (including the 10,000-foot Sandia Peak) to the east, the Sangre de Cristos to the north, and the dormant volcanoes of the West Mesa. The course, which offers three different nines, features the subtle mounding and native grasses common to links courses, along with eight lakes to add to the variety and the challenge. The Tamaya/Cheena combination is considered the best, and the Cheena nine is said by some to be the most challenging nine-hole layout in New Mexico. The Tamaya/Cheena course plays to 7,079 yards from the Championship tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 132 on Bluegrass fairways and Bent grass greens. Some of the most noteworthy holes on the Tamaya nine include No. 5, a par-5 that plays as the #2-handicap hole. The hole plays to 585 yards from the Back (Blue) tees and calls for a tee shot to a fairway landing area guarded by two bunkers on the right. The second shot plays to a narrowing fairway that doglegs slightly left and is guarded by more bunkers, before playing to a green tucked amid native grasses and guarded by more bunkers. Hole No. 6 (15 overall) on the Cheena back nine is a par-4 that plays to 336 yards from the Blue tees. This is one of the most picturesque holes on the course, as golfers tee off beside a small lake to a fairway landing area that eventually doglegs right around another lake. Approach shots will be forced to carry that water hazard and find a long green tucked behind the lake and guarded by a sand bunker in front. Hole No. 9 (18 overall) on the Cheena course is very similar, as golfers tee off beside another small lake to a long, narrow fairway. The par-4 hole plays to 429 yards from the Back (Blue) tees, and the fairway landing area is guarded by a long sand bunker on the left and a few trees on the right. Approach shots must then aim for a green that curves left around another water hazard, and is also guarded by some long sand bunkers on the right. Since opening in 1990, Santa Ana Golf Club has been accorded a number of honors, including being ranked #33 in the nation by Golf Digest among the Top 40 Resort Golf Courses. And both Golf Digest and Golfweek have at one time or another ranked the course among the Top 100 Courses in the country. Practice facilities at Santa Ana include a practice range and pitching and putting greens. Instruction is also available, as well as a full-service pro shop which includes club rental and repair, as well as lockers and club storage.

Its name derives from proximity to the city of Taos and the steep walls of the surrounding canyon, which make it virtually impassable except by raft or kayak. The rushing waters of Taos Box have been rated Class 4 to Class 5, meaning difficult to very difficult. Some who have made the trip liken it to taking an open boat through a car wash or trying to swimming in a churning washing machine.

Guided adventures through Taos Box typically take a full day. The Taos Box rafting season starts in April, and the greatest flows typically occur in early June.

"The Whittlesey House","New-Mexico","The Whittlesey House - Albuquerque, New Mexico - Historic Log House and Press Club Home","In 1903, Charles Whittlesey built a home for his family in Albuquerque, modeling it after a Norwegian-style log cabin. It included a huge living room with a gigantic fireplace, a ten-foot wide veranda on three sides, and recessed window seats. The interior space was so large, it would later be able to accommodate parties of up to 175 guests comfortably. The Whittlesey House was sold in 1920 to Clifford Hall MacCallum, head nurse at the local sanitarium. She remained there forty years, remodeling the interior to create a local showplace and gathering site for artists and writers. In 1960, Whittlesey House was obtained by Lambda Chi Alpha, who used its many apartment-like rooms for fraternity housing. Six years later, John T. Roberson bought the building and leased it out as a home for indigent men. Then, in 1973, the Albuquerque Press Club (APC) purchased the property. It has served as their private clubhouse ever since.

It is the site of the Ancestral Pueblo village of Tsankawi, where cave-like rooms called cavates'' and ancient petroglyphs can still be seen today. The Tsankawi Trail covers about 1.5~2 miles, reaching the top of the mesa over prehistoric routes tread by so many feet that in some places ruts have been worn several feet deep into the soft volcanic tuff. Other sections are so steep that ladders are a required part of the trail. Atop the mesa is what remains of a large pueblo constructed in the 15th century.

"Twin Warriors Golf Club","New-Mexico","Twin Warriors Golf Club - Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico - Beautifully Landscaped Golf Course near Albuquerque","The Twin Warriors Golf Club is owned and operated by the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort & Spa. Its name derives from two warriors that led the Santa Ana Pueblo tribe to settle in the Rio Grande area many generations ago. Opened in May 2001, the club's 18-hole championship course covers a monstrous 7,736 yards. Golf Digest has ranked it as the number three golf course in the state and the 49th best public golf course in country. Twin Warriors has twice been host to the PGA Club Pro National Championship. Gary Panks designed the course to be world class. It has water features incorporated into the high desert, with bluegrass fairways passing by some 20 archeological sites and ancient dwellings. There are grassy knolls and ridges, stands of juniper and pinyon pine trees, dry washes called arroyos, and a sacred butte named Tuyuna or Snakehead.'' The beautiful Sandia Mountains serve as a backdrop. After finishing a round, players can relax in the Atush Bar & Grille, with a menu of reasonably priced sandwiches, burgers, snacks and beverages.

"Twin Warriors Golf Club in Santa Ana Pueblo","New-Mexico","Twin Warriors Golf Club in Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico - A Unique, High-Desert Golf Experience","Twin Warriors Golf Club features 18 holes of championship golf, set amid 20 ancient cultural sites of Native American habitation and activity. The site of the club is where the people of Santa Ana believe the Twin Warriors once showed them the path to the Upper World along the banks of the Rio Grande River. The course, which opened in 2001, is situated more than 5,000 feet above sea level, but is still said to play long and tough. The layout weaves through and around native cultural sites near the Sandia Mountains, and features wide fairways framed by arroyos (dry gullies, or washes''), features of eroded land, as well as the sacred butte, Tuyunna (aka, Snakehead''), to provide a unique, high-desert golfing experience. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which was designed by Gary Panks, plays to a massive 7,736 yards from the Tour/Copper Tees, but a much more manageable 6,914 yards from the Back (White) Tees, with a USGA rating of 71.5 and a slope rating of 131 on Hybrid Bluegrass fairways, Bluegrass and Fescue roughs, and Bentgrass greens. The course also features some picturesque, grassy knolls and ridges that are speckled with Juniper and Pinon pine trees. Some of the more noteworthy holes on the course include No. 3, which is an arduous par-4 that plays to 440 yards from the Back (White) tees. From the tee, golfers must hit over a native area to a somewhat narrow fairway landing area guarded by bunkers on the left and vegetation on the right. Approach shots then play through a broad valley to an elevated green that's protected by both deep sand bunkers and grass bunkers on the right. Hole No. 4 is the signature hole for the course. This par-3 plays to 178 yards from the Back tees, and is situated behind a large lake that's flanked on the left by ponds and waterfalls. There's also a lone bunker on the right that tends to capture many tee shots playing away from the water hazards. Hole No. 10 is considered by many to be the most intimidating hole on the course. This par-4 plays to a lengthy 447 yards from the Back tees and plays over two native areas, first to the landing area off the tee and then to an elevated green. On this hole, most golfers are said to be thrilled with a par and happy with a bogey.'' Hole No. 13 is a par-3 that plays to 153 yards from the forward men's tees. The tee box is set on a hilltop, and the shot plays over a deep ravine to a green set upon a plateau at the edge of a cliff. Adding to the difficulty are the intimidating bunkers at the edge of the cliff and the mountain winds that are said to be tricky. Twin Warriors has received a good deal of acclaim since its opening, including receiving a 41/2-Star rating from Golf Digest and a Silver Award from GOLF Magazine in 2008-2009. The course has also played host to a number of tournaments, including the U.S. Open Qualifier from 2001-2007, and the 2003 and 2009 PGA Professional National Championship. Practice facilities at Twin Warriors include a driving range, two short-game practice areas and a practice putting green. Instruction is also available, including a Golf School. Twin Warriors Golf Club is located at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort and Spa, which provides a number of dining options as well as other resort activities."
"Una Vida","New-Mexico","Una Vida - Nageezi, New Mexico - Ancient Great House in Chaco Canyon","Meaning one life'' in Spanish, Una Vida is what remains of an ancient great house,'' one of five such structures existing in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon. It was originally built in 847 AD and expanded until 1093, eventually covering a floor area of almost 95,000 square feet. The ruins feature distinctive masonry, a great kiva, and evidence of a huge, multi-storied public building. Navajo legend has it that this was the home of a witchcraft woman,'' who would hold hostages atop nearby Fajada Butte without food or water. Petroglyphs discovered on the cliff face behind Una Vida were made by the Anasazi residents of the area some ten centuries ago. They show geometric and humanoid shapes, as well as animal forms thought to be bighorn sheep. The hike to the ruins of Una Vida from the Visitor Center of Chaco Culture National Historical Park covers only about half a mile. The trailhead can be found near the northeast corner of the parking lot, and the rocky path can be challenging, especially the steep sections when wet and slippery. Visitors are advised to bring water and sunscreen. A self-guided tour of the ruins takes about 45 minutes."

"University of New Mexico Golf Course","New-Mexico","University of New Mexico Golf Course, Albuquerque, New Mexico ? Considered One of the Best Golf Courses in the Southwest Since 1967","The Championship Golf Course at the University of New Mexico has held a position of prominence in the Southwest since opening in 1967. The layout is a Robert (Red) Lawrence design that makes use of the naturally hilly terrain to provide many elevation changes, with wide, rolling fairways that play long and difficult from the tournament tees. While not considered a true desert course, the course plays at an elevation of 5,300 feet above sea level and winds through some desert-like land that is home to all manner of wildlife - from hawks and owls, to rabbits, roadrunners, and even coyotes on occasion. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,324 yards from the Gold tees, and 6,954 from the Blues, which have a USGA rating of 73.2 and a slope rating of 132. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 9, which plays as the #1-handicap hole on the course. This par-5 plays to 573 yards from the Blue tees and features a long, narrow fairway that doglegs right. The key on this hole is staying out of the desert, which is not far from the short grass on either side. Approach shots then play to a narrow green that's 46 yards long and guarded by five bunkers left and right. Hole No. 11 is a par-3 that plays to 181 yards from the Blue tees and requires an accurate shot to an undulating green that's guarded by water in front and a sand bunker on the right. Hole No. 14 plays as the #2-handicap hole on the course. This par-5 plays to 545 yards from the Blue tees and features a straight but undulating fairway that may not offer many flat lies. Approach shots are key here, as a narrow, elevated, two-tiered green demands a lofted shot that stops quickly. Hole No. 15 is a par-4 that plays to only 355 yards from the Blue tees, yet offers significant challenge, especially for first-time visitors to the course. The hole doglegs left around a long, narrow lake, and the tee shot calls for a layup to a fairway that ends about 60 yards short of the green. The difficulty here is that most approach shots are semi-blind and must carry the large trees at the corner of the dogleg to reach a well-bunkered green. Throughout its existence, the Championship Course has received many awards. Golf & Travel Magazine named it one of the Top 40 Daily Fee Courses in America in 2000-2001, while Golf Digest gave it a 4-Star Award and named it the Fourth Best Course in New Mexico in the same year. In 1999, the New England Financial Journal also named it the #1 College Course Open to Non-Members. The course has also played host to numerous tournaments, including the William H. Tucker Invitational for more than 34 years, the Dick McGuire Intercollegiate since 1979, as well as many NCAA Golf Championships. Practice facilities include a large driving range, three practice greens and a unique, 3-hole beginner's course. Golf lessons and custom club fitting are also available at a full-serive golf shop."

"Volcano Park","New-Mexico","Volcano Park - Albuquerque, New Mexico - Five Volcanoes and Ancient Petroglyphs","Under the management of the National Park Service, Volcano Park comprises the remnants of five cinder cone volcanoes bordering the West Mesa Open Space just outside Albuquerque. These geological formations came into existence more than 100,000 years ago. They were the final event in an epoch of fissure eruptions that covered the surrounding landscape with basalt and created a seventeen-mile-long escarpment. In the thousands of years that followed, innumerable basalt boulders fell down to the escarpment's edge. These provided a canvass, as it were, for Puebloans and Spanish settlers to carve petroglyphs as a history of their peoples. Most of the finest examples of this artwork are located at the neighboring Petroglyph National Monument, established in 1990, although many examples remain as part of Volcano Park.

"Wild Earth Llama Adventures","New-Mexico","Wild Earth Llama Adventures - Taos, New Mexico - Trekking New Mexico with Llamas","Carrying lots of gear on a lengthy mountain hike or to a wilderness campsite is hard work. That's why Wild Earth Llama Adventures offers llama trekking excursions in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and the Rio Grande Gorge outside Taos and Santa Fe. Experienced guides head up the tours, which range from day hikes with a gourmet lunch included to educational multi-day outings. The adventures take place in less frequently visited wilderness areas, where sure-footed llamas transport the heavy loads so that participants can simply enjoy the solitude and surrounding beauty of New Mexico's great outdoors. The naturalists who lead the way are more than happy to point out local plants and native wildlife, describe the area's natural and cultural history, and teach wilderness living skills, too. The guides will also explain why llamas are the perfect traveling companions. They have been used in the Andes for more than 5,000 years and are selectively bred for gentleness to follow both adults and children alike. They are low-impact, high-altitude pack animals with natural agility and keen senses - alert, curious, and loyal to a fault. Family owned and operated, Wild Earth Llama Adventures is New Mexico's oldest llama trekking outfitter and also the most experienced. Treks are conducted under permits issued by the Carson and Santa Fe National Forests, along with permission from the Taos and Albuquerque offices of the BLM."
