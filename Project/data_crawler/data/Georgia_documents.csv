Abercorn Common also makes use of a cistern for collecting an estimated 5,000,000 gallons of rainwater per year from the all the roofs in the entire shopping center that is later used for irrigation purposes. Additionally, the center uses only ultra-low flow fixtures, toilets and waterless urinals.

During the construction period, over 6,000 tons of material was either recycled or reused, and the center has continued to be green after its construction by offering on-site cardboard, plastic and glass recycling. The environmentally conscious community even goes so far as to reward patrons who drive hybrids and tenants that carpool with preferred parking spaces.

"Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum: Atlanta's Painting of Its Past","Georgia","Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum: Atlanta's Painting of Its Past","The Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum tells the story of the Battle of Atlanta, a major turning point not just in the war, but in the city's history. The Cyclorama is located in Grant Park, about one mile east of downtown Atlanta. Nearby attractions include the adjacent Zoo Atlanta, Turner Field and Oakland Cemetery. The Cyclorama is about five minutes from Interstate 20. There is no rapid transit to the site, but several bus lines serve the area. A cyclorama is a huge painting, in this case 358 feet long and 42 feet wide, that is intended to be shown in the round. Roadside Georgia describes a cyclorama as show in a cylindrical room or building that featured a painting on the outer wall of the room and the patrons seated (or standing) in the center.'' The paintings were sometimes augmented with three-dimensional figures placed in a diorama in front of the painting to give it more depth and realism. Atlanta's diorama features figures as tall as three feet. The bleachers in the middle of the theater rotate as visitors watch the painting and listen to narration. Cycloramas became popular in America after the Civil War, and according to an article in America's Civil War, During their heyday in the 1880s, seven cycloramas ... enticed audiences with depictions of Civil War action. ... All seven owed much of their appeal to a novel union of sculpture and painting.'' The paintings were the IMAX films of their day, traveling from city to city and drawing huge crowds. By the early 20th century, with the advent of motion pictures, cycloramas were no longer popular. Only 20 remain in the world, and only two of those are in the United States. Atlanta's cyclorama depicts the Battle of Atlanta, the bloody day in July of 1864 that marked a turning point in the Atlanta Campaign. Although the city would not fall for another six weeks, Confederate losses that day were devastating. Tradition holds that Union General John Logan, who appears in the painting, commissioned the work for his vice-presidential campaign in 1884. He billed it as Logan's Great Battle,'' although, in reality, he had little to do with the Battle of Atlanta. Logan died before the painting could help him in his career. The painting, completed in 1886 and first displayed in Detroit in 1887, traveled around the country for several years. It came to Atlanta in 1892 and became the property of the city in 1898. In 1921, the present building was specially constructed to display the painting. Today, the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum exhibits the painting (which is billed as the largest in the world, although measurements show that Gettysburg's cyclorama is larger), a movie that places the Battle of Atlanta in its historic context, a museum with artifacts from the war and the Texas, one of the two locomotives that took part in the Great Locomotive Chase of 1862. The painting was restored between 1979 and 1982, although some experts believe that it needs more conservation work if it is to survive long-term. A field trip to the Cyclorama is a rite of passage for Georgia schoolchildren. Reviews of the Atlanta Cyclorama & Civil War Museum are very positive. Frommer's says, For 21st-century tourists, the concept and story of the Cyclorama are as interesting as the action depicted, and the restoration is incredibly impressive.'' Even those who were not anticipating much found it a totally unexpected and pleasant surprise!'' Another visitor says, Okay, this is a Atlanta must-see. I not a Civil War buff, but I really enjoyed this.'' However, another person says, I wasn't as impressed ... as others. ...If you are a Civil War buff, perhaps this would be more exciting to see.'' Even if you don't go for the history, the painting itself is an impressive artifact of a bygone era of entertainment."
"Atlanta History Center: Atlanta's Document of the Past","Georgia","Atlanta History Center: Atlanta's Document of the Past","The Atlanta History Center is one of the largest urban and suburban history museums in the country. It is located in Buckhead, Atlanta's most upscale residential, shopping and business district, on the grounds of an old estate. The museum is accessible from Georgia Highway 400. It is about ten minutes from the exclusive hotels and shopping malls that make up the heart of Buckhead, including Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza. The History Center was started in 1926 as the Atlanta Historical Society, but it did not have a permanent location until 1993, when its present building opened on 33 acres of the former Inman estate in Buckhead. The Inman home, known as the Swan House, was built in 1928 and designed by Philip Trammell Schutze, one of Atlanta's most prominent early-20th-century architects. The Swan House is the visual centerpiece of the History Center, but a new, 83,000-square-foot building was built on the property to house the permanent and rotating exhibits offered by the museum. The History Center has two historic properties on its Buckhead site and an additional property in Midtown Atlanta. Tours of the properties come with admission to the museum. They are: The Swan House, a 1928 Renaissance Revival mansion once owned by one of the wealthiest families in Atlanta. The Atlanta Historical Society has owned the Swan House since 1966. The house is one of the grandest in the city and shows upper-class life as it was just before the Great Depression. The Tullie Smith farm, a circa-1840 farmhouse that was moved to the site to be a part of the History Center. The house and its grounds are a working farm, an example of the yeoman,'' or small landowner, farm life in Georgia in the mid-19th century. The Margaret Mitchell House, the apartment building where Margaret Mitchell wrote Gone With the Wind. The building houses exhibits related to the book and movie and hosts literary lectures, readings and classes. The Atlanta History Center has six permanent exhibits and an ongoing slate of rotating and traveling exhibits. Among the permanent exhibits are: Turning Point: The American Civil War, which, with over 1,500 artifacts, is, according to the museum's website, one of the nation's largest and most complete Civil War exhibitions.'' Metropolitan Frontiers, which chronicles Atlanta's history from 1835 to the present. The Centennial Olympic Games Museum, a record not only of Atlanta's Games, but of the modern Olympic movement. The 33-acre grounds of the Atlanta History Center also include several historically significant gardens, including the: Mary Howard Gilbert Memorial Quarry Garden, a three-acre collection of plants that were native to Georgia before it was settled by Europeans. Tullie Smith Farm Gardens, a working garden of vegetables and herbs that provided food, income and pleasure in pre-Civil War Georgia. Swan House Gardens and Grounds, an elaborate garden area based on the formal European gardens of the 18th century. The Atlanta History Center has much more to offer - educational programs, a renowned research center, corporate and social event space, annual festivals and summer camps. The Swan House is one of the most popular wedding spots in Atlanta. The Swan Coach House offers an elegant cafy and gift shop. The museum is very popular among its visitors. Reviewers on well-known travel websites have almost unanimously high opinions. A common thread is that the center inevitably needs more time than has been allotted for the visit. The wide variety of exhibits, gardens and historical properties is also a hit. This reviewer, however, sums up the experience, saying, I've been to a lot of museums in my day - but none as captivating and thorough as this.''"

"Atlantic Station","Georgia","Atlantic Station - Atlanta, Georgia - Open-Air Retail Shopping Center with Dining, Cinema and Entertainment plus Residential Living","Atlantic Station, a live-work-play redevelopment on 138 acres of land in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia is composed of three distinct areas: the District, the Commons and the Village. Once the contaminated location of a hundred-year-old steel mill that ceased operation in 1998, the site was able to secure the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) seal-of-approval as safe for construction on December 11, 2001. The EPA' s certification was granted after years of environmental cleanup, and the property required a $250 million investment for the building of roads, sewers and utility lines prior to beginning construction of buildings in 2002. The redevelopment is the largest of urban brownfield projects in the United States, and much of the commercial development in the District is built on top of a 15,000-slot parking structure constructed on contaminated grounds. James F. Jacoby, the president of Atlanta-based Jacoby Development, Inc. originally conceived the idea for the $2 billion plus venture in 1996, and brought AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., the leading project investor, on board in 1999 to form a partnership in overseeing the expansion of Atlantic Station. The District, a one million square-foot open-air center, includes a variety of both unique and national brand shops, restaurants and a 16-screen Regal Cinema movie theater. Additionally, the District will eventually have mid to high-rise office buildings and over 300 two-story lofts developed by the Lane Company and positioned directly above shops and restaurants. Beazer Homes will be selling their 200 plus townhouses and singe-family homes in the same area. The Commons, home to a park and lake complete with fountains, is a residential neighborhood consisting of apartments, townhouses and high-rise condominiums. The park within the Commons area is envisioned to be the community gathering point for concerts and festivals. Anchored by a 366,000-square-foot IKEA home furnishing store, the first to be built in the Southeast U.S., the Village is also a residential neighborhood composed of freestanding homes and is expected to eventually serve as the meeting place of the community. Viewed as a national model for multibillion-dollar large-scale mixed-use sustainable developments, or cities within cities,'' the retail center was awarded the Atlanta Business Chronicle's Best in Atlanta Real Estate Award in the retail category. Atlantic Station, upon its completion, is projected to offer 5,000 residential units, including condos, townhouses and apartments; 1,000 hotel rooms; 6 million square feet of Class A offices; 2 million square feet of retail and entertainment areas; and public park space spanning a total of 11 acres. The expansive community is expected to provide living quarters for 10,000 people, job opportunities for 30,000 people and shopping and entertainment for millions. The development site, which initially was cut-off from Downtown Atlanta by two merging Interstate highways, is now accessible from a highway overpass and pedestrian bridge directly connected to the downtown area."

It is immediately accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. The building is close to all of Midtown's attractions, including the Woodruff Arts Center, the Ferst Center for the Arts, Atlantic Station, the Varsity, the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Piedmont Park. It is also convenient to both downtown Atlanta and the Buckhead area. Atlanta's public transit system, MARTA, has a train station half-a-block away, and several bus lines serve the area. Built in 1992, Bank of America Plaza is not only the tallest building in Atlanta, at 1,023 feet (312 m); it is the tallest building in the Southeast, the ninth-tallest in the United States (and the tallest in the country outside of New York and Chicago), and the 35th-tallest in the world. The building was noted for its rapid construction; it was finished in only 14 months, a remarkably short time for a building over 1,000 feet tall. It held another record in Atlanta, as well - when it changed owners in 2006, it sold for $436 million, or $348 per square foot, the highest per-square-foot price of any building ever sold in Atlanta at that time. The building is built in the Postmodern style of architecture, a style which evolved from the strict rules of Internationalism but differs from the International style by referencing other periods and adding playful, ornamental touches. Bank of America Plaza's Postmodernism echoes the Art Deco style of New York's Empire State Building and Chrysler Building with its graceful, soaring vertical lines and beveled corners, ornamented by its 270-foot top. The building's 55 stories, built in strikingly dark granite, are topped by a 180-foot open steel grid that forms a pyramid, which is then topped by a 90-foot spire. The spire is covered by 405 square feet of 23-karat gold leaf, and the pyramid is lit from within. At night, the top of the building glows a warm, yellow-orange color, which contrasts with the dark color of the building itself. The interior of Bank of America Plaza is equally inviting. Public areas are contemporary and comfortable. A conference auditorium is available with stadium seating. A 17,000-square-foot health club for tenants offers state-of-the-art equipment, and office workers can eat in a 16,000-square-foot cafeteria. The building integrates with its streetscape through a greenspace with park seating and a dining area. In addition to Atlanta's Bank of America offices, the building contains many of the city's premier law, financial, accounting and real estate firms. BentleyForbes, Bank of America Plaza's owners, are negotiating to convert the lower 16 floors of the building into a five-star hotel containing 315 rooms. Since this would require moving offices from these floors to other parts of the building, and given the recessionary state of the economy, BentleyForbes has not revealed the name of the hotel. They also hope to bring two upscale restaurants to the building. Reviews of the skyscraper are mixed - most either love it or hate it. One says, At night, this building is awe-inspiring.'' Another calls the building my favorite American skyscraper.'' Typical of the negative comments is this one, saying, Probably my least-liked 1000-footer on the planet right now ... [especially] that scrap pile on top.'' Either way, Bank of America Plaza is likely to remain Atlanta's tallest building for some time, as plans for the city's growth do not seem to include anymore super-tall skyscrapers."

"Bartram Trail","Georgia","Bartram Trail","Bartram Trail is multi-state designated a National Recreation Trail and in North Georgia it stretches from the Georgia-North Carolina border southwest over the summit of Rabun Bald (Georgia's second highest peak), turns south-southeast to the Chattooga River and then heads northeast paralleling the river to the GA 28 bridge.  The trail approximates the route of 18th century naturalist and explorer William Bartram through North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana. In many places the Bartram Trail is unmarked and poorly maintained or completely obliterated by modern construction. Just south of the North Carolina border the Bartram Trail crosses Hale Ridge Road, running southwest. It continues generally southwest from here to just past Raven Knob, where it turns almost due south. The route rises and falls until the base of Rabun Bald. Here, about 3 miles into the trail, the path begins to rise to the bald. This forest has been repeatedly harvested, so it does not look as Bartram describes it. Rising to the Bald, the trail is a rocky affair (we call it a scramble). A structure at the top provides for great 360 degree views rivaled only by the lookout tower on Brasstown Bald. Experienced hikers can go to Rabun Bald and return in a day."

"Bonaventure Cemetery: Savannah's Most Beautiful Resting Place","Georgia","Bonaventure Cemetery: Savannah's Most Beautiful Resting Place","Bonaventure Cemetery is located on the eastern edge of the city of Savannah on a bluff overlooking the Wilmington River. The cemetery can be reached from U.S. Highway 80, which is accessible from Interstates 16 and 516. Bonaventure is a cultural and historical landmark for Savannah and all of Georgia. The cemetery is the setting for part of the novel and movie Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In 2001, the cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Bonaventure's allure as a tourist destination comes from its beauty as much as its historic significance. The cemetery is planted with live oaks, which line and arch over the roadways, hanging with Spanish moss. The river and marshes along its eastern border provide beautiful scenery for a walk. Then there are the graves themselves, adorned with hauntingly lovely sculptures that make for excellent photography in the shade of the oaks as well as inspire legends about their origins. The cemetery began as the estate and family cemetery for the Tattnalls, who were descended from the original owners of the land, the Mullrynes. The Mullrynes settled there in 1762, and it was Colonel Mullryne who planted the original oaks, some of which remain on the property. The estate was a significant site during the American Revolution, but by 1817 it was uninhabited. In 1847, it was developed as a private cemetery and, in 1907, was sold to the City of Savannah. Many figures of historical and cultural significance are buried in Bonaventure, including numerous Georgia politicians, soldiers and civic leaders. Johnny Mercer, the composer of such pop classics as Moon River'' and Accentuate the Positive'' lies in Bonaventure. Visitors to his grave are encouraged to sit on the bench a while and leave a penny when they go. Pulitzer-prize-winning poet Conrad Aiken and his wife, artist Mary Hoover Aiken, also rest in the cemetery. The most famous residents of Bonaventure, however, are the statues. Little Gracie'' is the lifelike representation of Grace Watson, a little girl who died in 1889 at the age of six. Her family was well-known, and the whole city mourned her death. John Walz, who later sculpted many of the city's monuments, copied Grace's image from a photograph a few years after her death. Visitors often leave donations or memorials with Little Gracie. Another statue, Corinne, is of a woman who threw herself into a nearby creek and drowned, disconsolate over a love affair. The most famous stone image of Bonaventure, however, is no longer there. Visitors looking for the Bird Girl,'' portrayed on the cover of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, will need to go downtown to the Telfair Museum, where she was moved for safekeeping after the book became so popular. Reviews of Bonaventure Cemetery on a well-known travel website are overwhelmingly positive. The natural beauty of the site combined with the mystery and legends that accompany its residents almost never fail to charm. It is called quite serene with its stone gardens and trees dripping with Spanish moss,'' and the most beautiful and enchanting cemetery I have ever seen.'' Some visitors warn that valuables may be stolen from vehicles, but many others counter that the cemetery is a very comfortable place to walk and take photographs. Precautions should be taken with valuables just as with any other urban location. Perhaps the loveliest and most accurate review of Bonaventure came from naturalist John Muir, who spent six nights in the cemetery on his walk from Indiana to Florida in 1867: I gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world. Bonaventure is called a graveyard, a town of the dead, but the few graves are powerless in such a depth of life. The rippling of living waters, the song of birds, the joyous confidence of flowers, the calm, undisturbable grandeur of the oaks, mark this place of graves as one of the Lord's most favored abodes of life and light.''"

Hotels, high rises, and condos line the streets with an urban section on Peachtree Road. Surrounding Buckhead neighborhood is a single family home district with many homes spread throughout the forests and hills of Atlanta.  Henry Irby purchased 202.5 acres in 1838 to create Peachtree, West Paces Ferry, and Roswell Roads. He started a general store and tavern in the north, which he eventually turned into Buckhead due to a story in which he killed a buck deer and placed the head in a prominent spot in the district. Before WWI the area was mostly country estates, but after 1956 it was turned into a shopping area with Lenox Square as the main shopping center. For more than 50 years those in Buckhead have requested that the neighborhood be turned into its own city, but as of 2008 it was still denied.

MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, serves Buckhead with three train stations and numerous bus lines. A community shuttle, the buc,'' stops at major shopping and office venues. Buckhead is home to over 100,000 people. It is the richest neighborhood in the Atlanta metro area and one of the richest in the nation. Many of Atlanta's finest estate homes are located in Buckhead, including the Georgia Governor's Mansion. In addition, most of the city's high-end residential high-rises are here. The city's two upscale shopping malls, Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, sit across from each other on Peachtree Road and offer Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, as well as many designer boutiques. Another shopping area, the Streets of Buckhead, is scheduled to open in 2010.

Some of the city's best fine-art galleries are located here, and two districts, Miami Circle and Bennett Street, are home to antiques, art studios and some of the funkier'' upscale galleries. A study from the University of Georgia called Buckhead the largest concentration of income and buying power to be found in the southern United States.'' The Robb Report named the community one of the ten Top Affluent Communities'' for some of the most beautiful mansions, best shopping and finest restaurants in the southeastern United States.'' Despite its glamour, the downtown'' part of Buckhead, known as the Village, had become rundown by the 1990s. Many of the older buildings held less-than-glamorous bars that catered to a young, rowdy crowd not in keeping with the sedate, old money'' feel of the area. Traffic on weekends had become unmanageable, and crime was on the rise. Civic leaders and local real estate developers undertook a plan to remake that part of Buckhead. The Streets of Buckhead, the new shopping development, is only a part of that plan. The Buckhead Community Improvement District plans to transform Peachtree Road into a boulevard that runs through a livable urban center, where sustained, balanced growth is compatible with a good quality of life.'' Their goals include better safety, improved public transportation and more pedestrian access. Although the recession has slowed Buckhead's latest wave of transformation, new luxury hotels, office buildings and high-rise condominiums continue to open. Everyone clearly expects Buckhead remain the center of Atlanta's wealth for a long time to come."

The cathedral can be reached within minutes from Interstate 85 or Georgia Highway 400. The church is about 15 minutes northeast of downtown Atlanta and 25 minutes northeast of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. From this location, the fine dining, shopping and cultural attractions of Buckhead are only minutes away. The first services of Christ the King Parish were held in 1936 in a large home on the future site of the church. In early 1937, the pope elevated the parish to Co-Cathedral status with the Diocese of Savannah. Construction began on the Cathedral of Christ the King later that year. The building was designed by Henry D. Dagit Jr., a prominent church architect, in the French Gothic Revival style, with beautiful stonemasonry, arches and rose windows. In 1939, Architectural Record Magazine named the cathedral the Most Beautiful Building in Atlanta.'' The parish was decreed the Archdiocese of Atlanta in 1956. Today the cathedral is home to one of the ten largest parishes in the United States. Its Archbishop, Wilton Gregory, was the first African American to be elected president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Archbishop Gregory is best known for dealing forthrightly and honestly with the aftermath of the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the Church. The Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Catholic priest and the editor of a conservative Catholic journal, said of Gregory in the Chicago Tribune, He's demonstrated he's among the most clear-thinking and plain-spoken and in some respects courageous of bishops.'' Gregory gained immediate popularity in Atlanta by reopening the Holy Week foot-washing ceremonies to women, reversing the decision of his predecessor. The cathedral is currently undergoing a renovation and expansion that will add a courtyard and park, additional classroom space and improved parking and traffic flow. The parish also operates a school on the cathedral grounds for kindergarten through eighth grade. The school has been named a No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School twice. Fewer than 300 schools in the country receive this honor every year. Christ the King engages in many different types of outreach to the community. Some of their outreach ministries include: Hosting two blood drives every year Working with other area churches to sponsor food drives and other services for those in need Partnering with Habitat for Humanity to build a home once a year Sponsoring mission trips to care for needy children in some of the poorest countries in the world Operating a residential facility for homeless families Ministering to Georgia's prison population Volunteering at local shelters The cathedral is known throughout the city for its beauty. It is a popular spot for weddings and may be used by both parishioners and non-parishioners. Brides caution that it is necessary to book far in advance and that the process of marrying here can be overwhelming, but none was dissatisfied in the end. One woman summed it up, saying, Everything I dreamed of for my wedding. ... The staff and Wedding Guild ... assure the ceremony runs smoothly from start to finish.''"

The Children's Museum of Atlanta, the Georgia Dome, CNN Center and Philips Arena. Other downtown attractions are minutes away by rapid transit or car. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, serves the area with three train stations, and several bus lines stop nearby. Billy Payne, the person most responsible for bringing the Centennial Olympic Games to Atlanta, had his office overlooking the area that would become the park. As described in the Atlanta Business Chronicle, he saw a depressing scene of dilapidated buildings and parking lots home to vagrants next to Olympic venues.'' Payne decided that the Olympics, and Atlanta, needed a gathering place, and Centennial Olympic Park was born. Payne calls the park the most important physical legacy of the games.'' The centerpiece of the 21-acre park is the Fountain of Rings, jets of water in the shape of the five Olympic Rings that perform'' to synchronized music and lights. The fountain is set in a splash plaza'' that is irresistible to children and adults alike, especially in the Atlanta heat. The fountain is surrounded by eight dramatic 65-foot-tall lighting towers. Other features of the park include the Great Lawn, where families gather to play or merely sit in the sun; an amphitheater, which features live performances throughout most of the year; a children's playground and two pavilions for picnics or get-togethers.

In addition, many special events are held in the park every year, including music and craft festivals, educational fairs, concerts by well-known recording artists, private parties and many more. Centennial Olympic Park's effect on Atlanta has been phenomenal. About three million visitors come to the park every year, and several billion dollars have been poured into the area in private investment. The Atlanta Business Chronicle says these investments have wrapped the park in world-class tourist destinations, hotels, restaurants and housing.'' More attractions and restaurants are planned around the park in the near future, as it continues to drive downtown Atlanta's renaissance as a tourist and resident destination. Bernie Marcus, a co-founder of Home Depot and the impetus behind the Georgia Aquarium, says in the Atlanta Business Chronicle, It's a guiding light and shining light for the city of Atlanta. It's been a great experiment, and it's not over yet.'' Reviews of the park on Internet travel websites are good, if not great. Out-of-towners, especially, think it's nice,'' but not spectacular. One visitor said, Overall, I wouldn't make a special trip to Atlanta just to see the park, but if you are here, it is a pleasant place to stop.'' Several reviewers point out that it is a nice stop between other attractions,'' that you can park once for the day, and then enjoy all the things downtown Atlanta has to offer.'' Residents of Atlanta, on the other hand, are very fond of their park and seem to use it more for concerts, to play in the fountain, or just to relax. One woman who lives nearby said, Great place to grab a paper and sit and drink coffee on a Sunday morning.'' If you're just passing through, you may want to use the park as a waystation to surrounding attractions, but if you live in Atlanta, this is a true park, used for family fun and relaxation."

"Chastain Park Amphitheater: Atlanta's Oldest Outdoor Music Venue","Georgia","Chastain Park Amphitheater: Atlanta's Oldest Outdoor Music Venue","The Chastain Park Amphitheater is a 6,000-seat outdoor performance space in the northern suburbs of Atlanta. The park is only minutes from Interstate 75, Interstate 285, Atlanta's beltway; and Georgia Highway 400. The amphitheater is a thriving music venue as well as a part of Atlanta's history. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied by Native Americans long before the interior of Georgia was settled by Europeans. The 268-acre Chastain Park, the largest park in Atlanta, was laid out in 1933 on the grounds of two alms houses, one for whites and one for blacks, which sheltered the city's poor. The alms houses still stand on the property. Many of the buildings in the park were built in classic 1930s style by the Works Progress Administration. The amphitheater was the dream of Troy Chastain, who was, at the time, supervisor of public buildings for the city of Atlanta. The venue opened in 1944 and the park was renamed for Chastain after his death in 1945. Many other recreational opportunities are available in the park, including golf, hiking, horseback riding, swimming and tennis. Chastain hosts an eclectic selection of musical performances throughout its season. It is the summer home of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, one of the country's top ten orchestras. Their Classic Chastain'' series alone attracts more than 100,000 visitors to the park each summer. The symphony has been playing Chastain since 1973. Other performers include adult contemporary and classic pop stars like Stevie Wonder, Harry Connick and Jackson Browne; soul and R&B artists like Al Green, John Legend and Etta James; younger, contemporary performers like Jay-Z and Jamie Foxx and country legends like Emmylou Harris and Lyle Lovett. For Atlantans, Chastain is a beloved venue not only for its wide variety of performers, but because of its long tradition of picnicking during concerts. Some shows are set up with tables in the audience, to which visitors may bring their own food and beverages, including alcohol. For many families, an elegant, candlelit dinner complete with wine is an annual event at Chastain. Porters are available to help carry items. If guests do not want to bring their own food, they can pre-order dinners and hors d'oeuvres from one of the two caterers at the park. The caterers will even set your table before you arrive. The catered food has a reputation for being delicious but overpriced. For non-table'' shows, food is not allowed, but guests may bring a one-liter or smaller beverage in a plastic container. A $2.3-million renovation in 2004 refurbished some of the park's older amenities, making them more modern and comfortable. Reviews of visits to the amphitheater are generally positive. One concert-goer called it a good place to kick back for an evening.'' Another said of the venue, Very fan friendly, every seat is good.'' A long-time complaint about hearing concerts at Chastain is the crowd noise. Many people, particularly the diners, are more interested in socializing than listening, which can be disruptive. Another criticism is lack of parking close to the amphitheater. One visitor advises others to be prepared for a long walk and to bring any food in a wheeled container. The Chastain Amphitheater is a local legend. Despite any drawbacks, it will continue to be a part of summers in Atlanta for many years to come."

The jail was moved to Montgomery Street in 1978 to be located next to the Chatham County Judicial Complex.   The facility is not large enough to house the number of inmates required, this resulted in a federal court order being placed that sets the maximum amount of inmates, therefore the jail required expansion. The jail opened a new extension to the facility off Chatham Parkway in 1988, and then in 1989 required another expansion to facilitate the number of inmates arriving at the jail. Construction began on another facility next to the current Detention Center and in 1993 the Detention Center comprised of 5 units. Even with the expansions the jail had the capacity to house 1224 inmates, it was realized in 2010 that the jail was running over capacity and another extension was required. A temporary housing unit was created to ease the overcrowding, although ongoing construction is in the process to be able to house up to 2800 inmates by the year 2012.

"City Hall: Atlanta's Historic Seat of Government","Georgia","City Hall: Atlanta's Historic Seat of Government","Atlanta City Hall, the seat of the city government, is a monumental Deco-Gothic tower built in 1930. The building is located in downtown Atlanta directly across the street from the Georgia Capitol. Nearby attractions include Turner Field, the Georgia Dome, Philips Arena, CNN Center and Oakland Cemetery. City Hall is accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has two train stations within four blocks, and several bus lines serve the area. The current City Hall building is the fourth for Atlanta. In 1925, the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce started the Forward Atlanta'' campaign, conceived to position the city as the leader of the New South.'' Soon after came calls for a new City Hall, one which could become a monument to the city's advancement and position as the leader of a New South,'' according to Robert Michael Craig, author of Atlanta Architecture: Art Deco to Modern Classic, 1929-1959. The building was designed by G. Lloyd Preacher, a prominent Atlanta architect. Preacher designed hundreds of buildings in the Southeast. Some of his other Atlanta projects include the Carnegie Building, the Medical Arts Building and the Briarcliff Apartments, but, according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, it may be the exotic exuberance and lavish detail of Atlanta City Hall that most endears Preacher to architectural devotees.'' The eleven-story tower has a three-story base with the remaining stories set back. The style is Art Deco with Gothic touches, although it is often referred to as Neo-Gothic. Craig calls it a masterpiece of Deco skyscraper architecture,'' putting together a Gothic verticality, a Sullivanesque organization of ornament, and setback forms inspired by 1916 New York zoning legislation.'' The building is constructed almost completely from materials from Georgia. The exterior is cream-colored terra cotta ornamented with olive terra cotta spandrels. Gothic touches include pointed arches, a cathedral-style porch and elaborate stone tracery. The interior public spaces feature two marble staircases, with its floors and walls in polished marble and ornate gilded-wood ceiling, entrance and elevator doors in heavy bronze, and brass fixtures,'' according to the AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta. In 1989, an addition was built onto City Hall. At the same time, the 1930 building was restored. Atlanta City Hall has been the site of much history. Three mayors in particular have shaped Atlanta's history from their office in the building: William B. Hartsfield. Hartsfield was instrumental in building Atlanta into the aviation hub of the South and, ultimately, of the country. He oversaw the peaceful integration of Atlanta schools in 1961 and called on the state legislature to integrate all of the state's schools. Ivan Allen Jr. Allen oversaw much of the city's desegregation in the mid-1960s. He also brought two professional sports teams to the city and encouraged the growth of civic and arts organizations. Maynard Jackson. Jackson was the first African-American elected mayor of a major Southern city. He upgraded Atlanta's airport, to which his name was later added, to international standards. Jackson also oversaw the opening of the city's rapid transit system and its Olympic bid. Robert Michael Craig says in his book, Atlanta City Hall was intended to embody in its vertical forms the energetic aspirations of a competitive city.'' Atlanta still has energetic aspirations,'' and City Hall still stands as one of the city's symbols."
"City Market: Savannah's Original Shopping Center","Georgia","City Market: Savannah's Original Shopping Center","The City Market, one of the oldest centers of commerce in the city, is located within a four-block area at the northwest corner of the Historic District. The market is three blocks from the western end of River Street and Factor's Walk and is within walking distance of many of the District's attractions, including the Ships of the Sea Maritime Museum and the Jepson Center for the Arts. The market is easily accessed from Interstate 16, and CAT, Savannah's public transit system, has a free downtown shuttle that stops there. This area has been a market at least since 1755, when farmers and fishermen gathered there to sell their products. Other services sprang up, including a barber shop and a blacksmith shop. Over the years, various market buildings were destroyed by fire and were replaced by newer ones. In 1872, a large, brick building with massive circular and arched windows was constructed at the market. This building was beloved by the people of Savannah. Nonetheless, in the 1950s, the building was declared obsolete. It was demolished in 1954 and replaced by a parking garage. At the same time, one of the city's fine old residences, the Davenport House, was being threatened with demolition. A group of seven women, devastated by the loss of the market building and horrified over the potential destruction of the Davenport House, moved into action. These women were the core of the Historic Savannah Foundation, which went on to inventory all of Savannah's historic buildings in the early 1960s. These seven women are often credited with saving what is now Savannah's Historic District, all inspired by the loss of the City Market building. Today, the market is once again a thriving commercial area. It is known for its art galleries, shopping and dining, as well as being a center for the city's cultural and entertainment activities. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution describes the market, saying, Blend the arty atmosphere of Paris' Left Bank with the languid, laid-back air of Georgia's Low Country, set it in downtown Savannah's historic district, and you've got City Market.'' Features of the market include: Art galleries. The work of dozens of popular artists can be found at the market, including photographs, sculpture and painting. In addition, the City Market Art Center has studios where visitors can see the artists at work. Shopping. Browsers at City Market can find a wide variety of products, including clothing and accessories, perfume, fine candies, cigars and gifts. Dining.

The City Market sponsors or hosts many annual happenings, including the Heart of Savannah 5K, Folkfest, ArtSquared, Christmas for Kids and a New Year's celebration. Reviews of City Market on travel websites are mixed. Southern Living says, It doesn't get more touristy in Savannah than City Market,'' and some visitors agree. One reviewer said, Typical souvenir shops ... However, there was a strong focus on local art which made the market better than most.'' Many people like the market's live music on the weekends, but find the shopping opportunities limited. Nonetheless, the market is a top destination for both locals and tourists, who seem to enjoy the atmosphere - a great place just to hang out'' - if nothing else."

"Crisson Gold Mine","Georgia","Crisson Gold Mine","While most people think of California when they think of the gold rush, people were actually heading to Georgia for riches long before gold was ever discovered out west. The Crisson Gold Mine was established in 1847 and operated as late as the early 1980's. The mine opened for public tours in 1969 and Crisson is the oldest gold mine in Northern Georgia. The mine is home to a 125-year old stamp mill that is still in operation, crushing quartz rock which contains gold. When the rock is crushed, it becomes ore. Visitors can still watch this process occur at the mine today. There are also rod mills and jaw crushers that are sometimes used during the recreational mining process. Guests love seeing the old equipment in action, as well as touring the actual mine. Ore is sold in five gallon buckets and visitors can do their panning at the mine or take the buckets home with them to sort through in their own backyards or sanitary tubs. The mine does offer access for miners with a little more expertise and they can use trammels to separate the gold from the sand at a more efficient rate of seed. Visitors can use the trammel if they purchase six or more buckets of ore. The mine also sells high-grade concentrated gold ore, creating an easier way to pan and be successful. These ore is sold in 15, 30 and 75 gallon buckets. The mine also offers Gem Stone grubbing for those in search of rubies, amethysts, emeralds, sapphires, crystals, garnets and other gems. "

"Double Barreled Cannon","Georgia","Double Barreled Cannon","In Athens, Georgia there is a double barreled cannon sitting prominently in a local park. The cannon is a remnant of the American Civil War. It was an experimental weapon of its time and the cannon has never seen battle. John Gilleland was a dentist, mechanic, and builder. In 1862 he designed the cannon that now sits in the Athens square. The building costs were $350. The two barrels have a 3 degree difference and can shoot two cannon balls at the same time. The cannon balls are connected to a chain. The idea was to use the chain like a scythe in order to completely wipe out the enemy target.  The invention, however, was a failure. It was tested on April 22, 1862. Gilleland aimed it at two poles. Unfortunately the uneven combustion of powder and imperfect barrels meant the movement was off kilter. All three test shots failed. Still, Gilleland tried to get the confederate army to take his invention to war. He even went to Augusta to promote the cannon to no avail. In 1864, there was a false report that it was used to stop union soldiers near Monroe, Georgia. The cannon is on display in front of City Hall as a landmark."

"East Atlanta","Georgia","East Atlanta","East Atlanta is a neighborhood in the eastern section of Atlanta, Georgia. The term does not apply to DeKalb County as the area was annexed by about 10 percent in 1909. Basically, East Atlanta is within Dekalb, but a separate neighborhood. For taxes and government services it is still considered part of Dekalb. East Village is known mostly for its urban village which has seen a renewal since the 1990s.  Historically, Atlanta was a hub for southern war efforts during the Civil War. Lemuel P. Grant designed fortifications around the eastside of Atlanta because of his plantation. It was land that is now Grant Park. General McPherson of the Union troops used East Atlanta as the high ground. A union cannon was set at Glenwood Avenue and Flat Shoals Road in order to protect the front line of the army at East Atlanta. So the land has a lot to do with the battles during the Civil War that struck Atlanta. After the war East Atlanta was able to recover to become an unincorporated town with mercantile stores, blacksmith, livery stable, grocery store, and more. Today East Atlanta is still a business district. The area is often called The Village with shopping at Little Five Points and Virginia Highland."
"East Atlanta: Atlanta's Funkiest Neighborhood","Georgia","East Atlanta: Atlanta's Funkiest Neighborhood","East Atlanta is a vibrant, eclectic neighborhood located about three miles southeast of downtown Atlanta. The community is about one half-mile south of Interstate 20. East Atlanta is only minutes away from all the attractions of downtown, including Turner Field, the Georgia Dome, CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park, and Philips Arena. It is also convenient to the city of Decatur. The neighborhood is served by several bus lines. In the years before the Civil War, the area that would become East Atlanta was quiet farmland. During the War, however, Atlanta's defenses were set up just to the west of the area; the Union Army camped there, and, during the Battle of Atlanta in July of 1864, 12,000 men were killed on the ground where East Atlanta Village now sits. After the war, a commercial village grew up to capture the farm trade outside of Atlanta. As Atlanta spread out, the area was developed into a true suburb. In the first two decades of the twentieth century, East Atlanta grew into a thriving town with new houses, businesses and public transportation. It followed the same pattern of decline that many of Atlanta's intown neighborhoods did, and by the 1960s, the area was crime- and drug-ridden. Only in the mid-1990s did East Atlanta become hot'' again, with young families moving back, restoring the housing stock and opening and reviving businesses. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution calls East Atlanta arguably, Atlanta's hippest neighborhood, a rough-around-the-edges alternative to Virginia Highland or Midtown with a slew of new restaurants and bars.'' The neighborhood has established itself as one of Atlanta's best places to hear live music from new or alternative bands. Atlanta chefs often try out their newest concepts in East Atlanta, and bars, coffeehouses and galleries draw both residents and visitors to the community. Restaurants, bars and other businesses retain a laidback, unpretentious feel that is often missing in more gentrified'' neighborhoods. But, as the AJC points out, there's still the crime issue.'' Violent crime is rare in the area, but property crimes and other non-violent crimes are more common. `You don't live out here without being cautious,''' says an East Atlanta resident quoted in the newspaper. But Caryn Liss, president of the East Atlanta Business Association, says the village is no different from other intown city neighborhoods.'' She goes on to say that the residents of the area are `are all really invested in this urban oasis of culture and community ... our crime is way down.''' Part of keeping the village thriving and safe is to involve the residents in community activities. Among the many regular happenings in East Atlanta are: The East Atlanta Village Farmer's Market, held weekly May through November, brings fresh, locally grown food, as well as gourmet products to the neighborhood. The market was chosen to participate in a pilot program that provides incentives for the area's low-income families to eat healthier food. The East Atlanta Strut, an annual street festival, features a parade, artist's market, live music and food, all for the benefit of local charities. A Taste of East Atlanta, an annual festival offering residents a chance to try food from the 20 or so area restaurants, including a wide variety of international cuisines. B*ATL, a celebration of the Battle of Atlanta, featuring tours, a 5K run/walk, a dinner and dance and Civil War history and reenactments. As East Atlanta continues to grow and change, this never-dull, constantly evolving neighborhood will certainly be worth keeping an eye on."

Other downtown and Midtown Atlanta venues are very convenient. The Georgia World Congress Center is also adjacent to the park. The area is easily accessed from Interstate 20 and the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, serves the location with a train station and several bus lines. The Embassy Suites at the park was built after the 1996 Olympics as city planners and developers looked for ways to capitalize on the increased tourist traffic to downtown Atlanta. In 1999, the Atlanta Journal Constitution noted, The first of the Centennial Olympic Park redevelopment ventures is ... the Embassy Suites hotel ... the first phase of a planned $100 million complex that will eventually include two residential buildings, another hotel and an office building.'' The 321-suite hotel opened in 1999 and has benefited greatly as more and more attractions have located around the park. The Atlanta Business Chronicle pointed out in 2006 that, perhaps no hotel is better situated to piggyback on the new sites than the Embassy Suites.'' The hotel's suites come in four different sizes, but all have two rooms with a sleeping sofa in the seating area. Wired Internet access is available in the rooms along with two telephone lines. A hot breakfast and reception in the evening with snacks and drinks are both complimentary. The largest suite, the Presidential, comes with a kitchenette. Other hotel amenities include the fitness center, open 24 hours a day, with weight and cardio machines, as well as free weights; an outdoor pool and sundeck; a 24-hour-a-day business center and wireless Internet access in the atrium.

The Deli is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and serves soups, salads and sandwiches. Ruth's Chris Steak House is considered one of the finest steak houses in the country. They are known for their thick, simply seasoned steaks served with sizzling butter. The food critic for the Atlanta Journal Constitution admires all sorts of thick, charred, gigantic prime steaks that come to the table sputtering hot butter; big ol' lobsters that are steamed and cracked for a hefty price; great shrimp cocktail; and an iceberg lettuce salad piled with a staggering heap of blue cheese crumbles.'' The Embassy Suites at Centennial Park is fairly popular among guests who have reviewed it on travel websites. It has the best location in Atlanta, right across from Centennial Park,'' says one. The breakfast buffet is a hit, although it can get crowded on weekends. Most guests find the hotel to be comfortable and clean, but, at ten years old, others think it may be time for a renovation. Some found the staff to be friendly, courteous and professional,'' while others encountered less helpful attitudes. The Professional Travel Guide calls Embassy Suites a refreshing alternative to the sky-high towers that surround it, and it is a more manageable choice than the downtown bigwigs. ... This place is not luxurious, but it's a great choice for business travelers or families.''"

"Ezekiel Harris House","Georgia","Ezekiel Harris House","The Ezekiel Harris House, circa 1797, is a reminder of the days when tobacco was the primary cash crop in Georgia. Following the Revolutionary War, the area which now includes Wilkes, Elbert, Franklin, Lincoln, Warren, Oglethorpe and Greene counties was opened for settlement. Liberal land grants and rich soil attracted tobacco planters who had depleted their farmlands in Virginia and North Carolina by planting tobacco year after year. Towns sprang up around the tobacco inspection stations and warehouses. Tobacco merchant vied with tobacco merchant and town competed with town for the market. Competition was very fierce between Augusta and Harrisburg.   Ezekiel Harris came to this area from Edgefield, South Carolina to build a town which he hoped would rival Augusta. In September, 1797, he announced in the Augusta Chronicle and Gazette of the State that his warehouse was in order to receive tobacco and he also offered accommodations for the planters in a good frame house with a brck chimney [which] will be ready by the first of January 1798. The gambrel roof gives the house a feeling of New England and the vaulted hallway is unique in this area. Tiered piazzas are supported by chamfered wooden posts.

"Factor's Walk: Savannah's Mercantile History on Display","Georgia","Factor's Walk: Savannah's Mercantile History on Display","Factor's Walk is a street and series of buildings on the northern edge of the Historic District in downtown Savannah. It runs between River Street and the Savannah River to the north, or down the bluff, and East Bay Street to the south, or up the bluff. The area is easily accessed from Interstate 16. Factor's Walk is within walking distance of most of the Historic District. It is near many of the large hotels and popular waterfront attractions in downtown. The Port of Savannah has played a key role in the city's history from its inception in 1733. The Georgia Historical Society's historical marker at Factor's Walk says that the first commercial house below the bluff opened in 1744.'' By the early 19th century, cotton was one of the country's major exports and Savannah was one of the busiest ports in the nation. M'Culloch's Universal Gazetteer of 1840 notes that Savannah is at present the centre of commerce for a large extent of [the] country.'' The 40-foot bluff on which the city was built posed a problem. M'Culloch's describes the setup:  The warehouses are numerous, generally lining the wharves ... most of them three or four stories high. The business is generally done in an upper story, entered from the top of the bluff, while the lower stores serve to receive the merchandise directly from the ships.'' The levels between the business offices and the warehouses became a series of buildings interconnected by walkways and bridges. These levels are where the factors,'' the men who factored how much cotton came in to be sold, worked. The cotton industry was decimated in the 1920s by the boll weevil, a pest that destroyed the crop. By the mid-1950s, all the cotton offices on the Savannah waterfront were gone. Today, Factor's Walk is a picturesque reminder of when cotton was king.'' The old buildings, cobblestone stairways and paths, and the connecting iron bridges fascinate history buffs and tourists alike. The buildings now house many different types of businesses, from the serious to the silly. An investment banker, a marketing company and an attorney have their offices there, and the Olde Harbour Inn offers guests a view of the river. Several antiques stores, art galleries, arts and crafts shops and a bookstore cater to the more serious shopper, while gift shops, a package store and the Aura Shop, featuring psychic readings by Sylvia, appeal to the lighter side of shopping on the waterfront. There are also several restaurants and bars along Factor's Walk. Reviews of the area from travel websites are mixed. Visitors love the history of the buildings themselves. One visitor commented, Factor's Walk is so steeped and interconnected in the history south ... I enjoyed the cobblestone roads and the fact that much of this area has not been `updated.''' Another notes, [I]t is full of the history of Georgia and the first Georgians.'' Many people had trouble navigating the steep ramps and old cobblestones, however, calling it hard to get around'' and a very uneven and sometimes steep street area of cobblestones that invites an ankle turning.'' Others do not care for the touristy'' feel of many of the shops, with one person calling it primarily a collection of t-shirt and cheap souvenir shops. Too bad that the city's river frontage hasn't been put to better use!'' Another person countered this entry by pointing out the many antique shops and galleries that are in Factor's Walk. Nonetheless, most reviewers think that the cradle of Georgia's commercial history is definitely worth a visit."
"Fernbank Science Center: Atlanta's Science Lab","Georgia","Fernbank Science Center: Atlanta's Science Lab","The Fernbank Science Center, a unit of the Dekalb County School System, is located in the prestigious Druid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta about 15 minutes northeast of downtown. Nearby attractions include the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, the Carter Center, the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts and the shops and restaurants of downtown Decatur. The Science Center is about ten minutes from both Interstate 285 and the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a bus line that stops near Fernbank. Although Fernbank Science Center's flashier sister organization, the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, gets all the attention, the Science Center is the original Fernbank, born from a schoolteacher's desire to have the 65-acre, old-growth Fernbank Forest preserved as a living laboratory of the life sciences. From that grew the Science Center, built in 1967. From a Teacher's Guide published that year, the Center states its purpose as a unique academic facility designed to enhance scientific literacy through a variety of programs and exhibits developed for all levels of student and community groups.'' Although Fernbank serves as a classroom for the county schools, it is also a museum and learning laboratory for the public and is open for field trips from other school systems. Some of the many features of the Fernbank Science Center include: Fernbank Forest. The forest is one of the few areas of nearly undisturbed forest left in Georgia, and certainly in Atlanta. One-and-a-half miles of trails with signs identifying trees and plants wind through the forest, which is enjoyed by all ages. During the school day, the forest is used for instruction, but it is open to the public during non-school hours. The Center conducts popular bird walks in the forest. The Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium. The planetarium, with a 500-seat theater and a 70-foot dome, is one of the largest in the country. It features several programs a week for students and the public, including special, themed shows and a weekly look at The Sky Tonight.'' Exhibit Hall. Exhibits cover a broad range of scientific topics and feature everything from a gem collection to the Apollo 6 Command Module. Instructional staff members are always on hand for explanations and demonstrations. The Fernbank Observatory. The observatory is home to a 36-inch telescope, the largest in the Southeast, and one of the largest in the country completely dedicated to public education and viewing. Public observations are offered two nights a week and are free. A partnership with NASA in the Science, Engineering, Mathematics and Aerospace Academy (SEMAA) outreach program, which, according to Fernbank's website, is designed to increase participation and retention of historically underrepresented K-12 youth in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.'' Advanced studies for students. These advanced after-school, for-credit classes offer students access to laboratories, working scientists and field explorations in a wide variety of subjects. Classes are free for Dekalb County students and available on a tuition basis for other students. Internet reviews of Fernbank Science Center are mixed. One visitor said, Your children will love it.'' Another, however, noted, My four-year-old was bored stiff.'' Many people love the forest, with one person calling it a pleasant retreat from the city.'' Because the Center is part of a school system, a visitor says, Don't expect a whole lot,'' but others find Fernbank a great educational resource that makes learning fun.'' The consensus seems to be that toddlers won't like it, but older children will. If you are going for flashy, state-of-the-art exhibits, go across the forest to the Museum of Natural History. But if you want a hands-on, educational experience, or if your child is lucky enough to use the center as part of school, then the Fernbank Science Center is a first-rate facility."

The model was created by Martin Dawe. The large version took six months to build and was sculpted by Randy Blain. His son, Randy, also helped.

"Forsyth Park: Savannah's Oldest Urban Park","Georgia","Forsyth Park: Savannah's Oldest Urban Park","Forsyth Park, originally known as Forsyth Place, is the largest park in the city of Savannah. It is located at the intersection of Drayton and Whitaker Streets. The park is about five blocks from Interstate 16 at the southern end of Savannah's historic district. Once at the edge of the city, Forsyth Park is now centrally located. Because of its desirable location, many of the city's most exclusive hotels and B&Bs are located on or near the park. When General James Oglethorpe laid out the city in 1733, it was the first city in North America to have a planned street design. He included many small squares, which served as focal points for their neighborhoods. He anticipated the inclusion of a larger park that would serve the entire city, but, as of the 1840s, no park had been built. When Paris began building parks and boulevards in the mid-19th century, many cities, including Savannah, emulated the continental style. Originally ten acres, the park was expanded to 30 acres by a gift from former Georgia governor John Forsyth. Points of interest in the park begin with the ornate, wrought-iron fountain, possibly modeled after the fountain in the Place de la Concorde in Paris. The fountain was added to the park in 1858. Every year during the St. Patrick's Day Festival, the 2nd largest St. Patrick's Day celebration in the country, the water in the graceful old fountain is dyed bright green. After the Civil War, a Confederate Memorial was installed to commemorate volunteers who died in the war. The park is also home to Hodgson Hall, a 19-century building which stores and exhibits artifacts from the Georgia Historical Society. The northern end of the park is more formal. It includes the famous fountain, quiet walking paths and formal gardens, including the Fragrant Garden for the Blind. This part of the park sees the most visitors from out of town. The southern end of the park is more recreational, with large fields for soccer or rugby, basketball courts, tennis courts and playgrounds. Local residents use this end of the park. Outdoor concerts and theatrical events occur frequently in the park. Forsyth Park is a popular place for events in Savannah. Many annual festivals are held in and around the park, including: the Savannah Pride Festival the Savannah Jazz Festival the Savannah Children's Book Festival the SCAD Sidewalk Arts Festival Mercer in the Park the Savannah Shakespeare Festival the Shalom Y'all Jewish Food Festival No one seems to have a negative review of Forsyth Park on any of the popular travel websites. Locals love it as a playground and respite from the city, and visitors from out of town rave about its beauty and charm as an emblem of the Old South. One commenter noted the pathways, the moss, the oaks and the picture perfect setting ... no words can describe the joy!'' Another summed it up by saying, No trip to Savannah is complete without a trip to the park!!!''"

Today the area is protected by the National Park Service.  The area preserves the remnants of a town that was built by James Oglethorpe; it was used to protect the southern boundary of the British colony of Georgia from the Spanish.

"Fort Frederica National Monument Georgia","Georgia","Fort Frederica National Monument Georgia","Fort Frederica National Monument is known for its astonishing beauty.  The area is full of Spanish moss, enormous oak trees, and large grape vines. The area was established in 1736, by James Oglethorpe, a British immigrant and general who used Frederica as a fort to protect the British colonies in Georgia and South Carolina from the Spanish settlers in Florida. He named the area after the Prince of Wales, Frederick Louis. Today what remains of Fort Frederica has become a national monument that bears archeological and geological data to the history of the area. The original fortress at Frederica was described by the Quakers as being beautiful and constructed mainly of brick. The monument includes a guardhouse, a stockade, three bastions, two storehouses and a projecting spur battery. Fort Frederica succeeded as a military bastion that was an excellent example of British power in the region. Fort Frederica National Monument is a historic place in American history and all the archeological remnants of Fort Frederica are protected by the National Park Service. The park is mostly an archeological site and contains ruins of the fort, barracks, and exposed foundations of many of the early homes.

"Fort McAllister: Savannah's Last Stand in the Civil War","Georgia","Fort McAllister: Savannah's Last Stand in the Civil War","Fort McAllister, home of an earthenwork fortification from the Civil War, is located about 30 miles from downtown Savannah and the Historic District. The fort can be reached via Interstate 95 south of the city. Other historic attractions in the area, besides the city itself, include the Wormsloe State Historic Site, Old Fort Jackson, and Fort Pulaski. Although the land where Fort McAllister sits today was occupied possibly as long as 5000 years ago and much archaeological work has been done there on the Native American inhabitants, it is remembered today for the role it played in the Civil War. At the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, the site's owner, Joseph L. McAllister, raised a company of troops to go fight in Virginia. Because of its strategic location to the south of Savannah at the mouth of the Ogeechee River, McAllister agreed to let a fort be constructed on his land. Significantly, the fort was not made of brick or masonry, but earthenwork. Jeffrey Mosser, writing in America's Civil War, describes the construction of the fort: Huge amounts of earth were piled into wooden frames to form the battery walls, or traverses. After the earth settled, the frames were removed, and grass was planted on the mounds and walls to prevent erosion.'' Fort Pulaski, just up the coast, was a massive masonry structure, but it fell to Union bombardment in only 36 hours. Fort McAllister withstood repeated bombardment until 1864. When hit by shells, the soldiers would simply stuff mud into the holes and fight on. As the last remaining Confederate fort in the area, General Sherman knew he had to take McAllister before he could claim Savannah. He decided to attack it from the land side, and within 15 minutes, the fort was in Union hands. After the Civil War, the fort was abandoned except for a brief time in the 1920s and `30s when Henry Ford (yes, Henry Ford) took an interest in the site. In the early 1960s, the land was given to the State of Georgia, and today, Fort McAllister is a state park. The park has camping facilities with full hook-ups near the edge of the marsh, as well as one pioneer campsite out in the marsh. Three fully equipped cabins are available for rental that face out onto the marsh. A museum features artifacts from the Civil War, including items recovered from the Nashville, a Confederate ship that became trapped upriver by the Union blockade and was eventually sunk by an iron-clad ship. There is also a nature trail that interprets marsh ecology, plus three miles of other hiking and biking trails. The park also stages events throughout the year that re-enact historic events and present living history exhibits of life before and during the Civil War in Georgia. Internet reviews of Fort McAllister are very positive. The campground is singled out as having superb facilities. One reviewer calls it one of my favorite campgrounds on the East Coast.'' Another person praises the peace and quiet'' of the park. The fort itself is sometimes overlooked by campers, but those who go for the history were impressed. One visitor said, The fort was very interesting and informative and the museum was nice and clean.'' A young woman claiming not to like anything war-related'' exclaimed, I'd never heard of this kind of fort, and it has been preserved so well that you could really imagine yourself there during the Civil War. Worth an afternoon!''"

The fort is located on more than 5,000 acres of scenic, pristine marshland that attracts visitors to both the natural element as well as the monument's history. The fort took a long eighteen years to construct and was not complete until 1847. An estimated twenty-five million bricks were used to construct the fort and wooden pilings were sunk seventy feet deep into the mud to support the structure. The walls of the fort are seven feet thick and very resistant to the military artillery of that time. Although the walls were thought to be impenetrable, visitors to the fort can view areas that were bombarded by cannons and gunfire. Upon its completion it was named after a Revolutionary War hero, Count Casimir Pulaski. It was Pulaski's courage and example that compelled him and his soldiers to recapture Savannah during the revolution. The initial garrisons of soldiers stationed at Fort Pulaski was 600 when the area was initially occupied. Fort Pulaski National Monument provides an educational and enlightening experience to those who attend.  The monument ensures that guests walk away enlightened by providing Ranger Talks and Demonstrations within the fort. During the summer, demonstrations and talks are held every day, but in other seasons the Ranger is only available on the weekends.

"Georgia State Capitol: Atlanta's Historic Statehouse","Georgia","Georgia State Capitol: Atlanta's Historic Statehouse","The Georgia State Capitol, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is located in downtown Atlanta. Nearby are many of the city's downtown attractions, including Turner Field, Oakland Cemetery, the Georgia Dome, CNN Center, the Georgia Aquarium and Centennial Olympic Park. The Capitol can be easily reached from either the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector or Interstate 20. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has several train stations within walking distance of the building. The State Capitol was completed in 1889. The National Park Service says of the building, In style, form, and plan, it is a perfect expression and symbol of the idea of a Capitol building for the `Capital of the New South,' as Atlanta was called after Reconstruction.'' Constructed in the Neo-Classical Renaissance Revival style, the building's main entrance is a four-story, pedimented portico with Corinthian columns. The structure is domed and plated with gold leaf mined in Georgia. A statue of Freedom tops the dome, holding a lighted lantern over her head. The interior of the building has an open rotunda with Georgia marble staircases sweeping up on either side. The legislative chambers are paneled in oak with highly detailed carvings. The grounds of the Capitol are landscaped with trees that are native to Georgia. In 2004, a ten-year restoration of the Capitol was completed, returning it, as much as possible, to its original state. The restoration was done meticulously, with great attention to historical accuracy. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the National Park Service sent experts to photograph every inch of the building. Using those photos, historical documents, architectural drawings, old black-and-white photographs and written descriptions, the experts made drawings that were used to guide much of the work.'' The original marble and brass work have been cleaned and replicas made where pieces had been lost. The original paint colors are in use again. The legislative chambers were redone to regain some of their lost splendor. The AJC says, The Capitol's simple beauty has slowly re-emerged. With a few exceptions ... it now looks much as it did more than a century ago.'' Tours of the Capitol are available which include an explanation of the Capitol's history and the legislative process that goes on there. The tour then goes to the fourth floor, where visitors can take a self-guided tour through the Georgia Capitol Museum. For schoolchildren, the museum is the highlight of the trip. Where's the two-headed calf?'' is the most frequently heard question. Yes, a two-headed calf, and there's a two-headed snake, too. The AJC quotes museum director Dorothy Olson: `They're not my favorites things,' said Olson, laughing. But she has a begrudging appreciation of them because they're wildly popular with the 50,000 or so students who tour the Capitol every year.'' The museum also exhibits more serious items from Georgia's history, geology and industry. Reviewers on popular travel websites are positive about the Georgia State Capitol, if not overwhelming. The consensus is that it is an interesting and educational couple of hours for the kids after seeing some of the city's more exciting attractions. One visitor said, While it is not the most interesting sight in Atlanta, it definitely is a good place to spend an hour or two if you are into history or architecture. The building is ... amazing.'' Another sums it up, noting, This is a great free place to visit where kids can learn a lot about how government works.''"

"Georgian Terrace Hotel: Atlanta's Grande Dame of Hotels","Georgia","Georgian Terrace Hotel: Atlanta's Grande Dame of Hotels","The Georgian Terrace Hotel is located in Atlanta's Midtown district on the corner of Atlanta's two most famous streets - Peachtree Street and Ponce de Leon Avenue. The hotel is accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. Atlanta's public transit system, MARTA, has a train station about three blocks away. Directly across Peachtree is the legendary Fabulous Fox Theatre, and many other attractions are only a short cab ride away, including the High Museum of Art, Piedmont Park, the Atlanta Botanical Garden and the Ferst Center for the Arts, not to mention all the entertainment, dining and nightlife that both Buckhead and downtown Atlanta have to offer. The Georgian Terrace, built in 1911, underwent an $11-million renovation in early 2009 that has brought the hotel into the modern era while leaving its old-world charm untouched. Its 360 rooms range in size from 160 to 2,700 square feet and include one-, two- and three-bedroom suites. Most rooms include a full kitchen and washer and dryer. All rooms have flat-screen TVs, free wireless Internet access and pillow-top mattresses. Two luxurious bridal suites have been added, as the hotel is a popular location for weddings. The hotel features two restaurants: Livingston Restaurant + Bar, an elegant, gourmet experience in a beautiful dining room; and Cafy Mims, which offers light fare for lunch and dinner. Both restaurants are overseen by one of Atlanta's most beloved chefs. A penthouse-level fitness center and rooftop pool add to the luxury. The Georgian Terrace has been repositioned as one of Atlanta's newest luxury hotels, but it is also one of the city's most glamorous historic buildings. The reception for the opening of the film Gone with the Wind was held here in 1939, and the hotel has hosted celebrities and dignitaries from the time it opened through its heyday in the 1930s and into the present. The building features a generous use of marble and glass, including a dramatic spiraling marble staircase. It was known after it opened as Atlanta's Paris hotel'' for its efforts to bring a European-style hotel to the city. In 1981, the hotel closed and was on the verge of being demolished. Instead, through the efforts of preservation groups, it became part of the Fox Theatre Historic District and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. New owner Matthew Reidy says of the renovation, We're breathing new life back into an old, iconic property in Atlanta. We felt there [were] some great opportunities to bring it back.'' The Georgian Terrace is also a popular venue for both social and business gatherings. It offers over 16,000 square feet of meeting space, including three ballrooms, a business center and up-to-date audio/visual equipment. Six of the meeting rooms are certified by the International Association of Conference Centers as using best practices for meetings. Only nine other facilities in Atlanta carry this certification. Reviews for the Georgian Terrace from a well-known travel website are mostly positive, although some people complained of noise and dust during the remodeling. Street noise is also apparently a problem. Most guests love the central location of the hotel, the size of the rooms and, of course, its grandeur. Comments include: The room was a home away from home,'' The bedroom has the most comfortable bed that I've ever slept in,'' and We were blown away by the charm of the lobby and its architectural distinction.'' Staff attitudes seem to run the gamut from incredibly helpful to incredibly rude. Perhaps as the Georgian Terrace grows past its newness, it can reclaim its reputation as the grandest hotel in the city."

"Grant Park: Atlanta's Largest Historic District","Georgia","Grant Park: Atlanta's Largest Historic District","Grant Park is both one of Atlanta's largest green spaces and its largest historic district. It is located about one mile east of downtown Atlanta. Interstate 20 runs through the middle of the neighborhood, but it can also be reached easily from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. Zoo Atlanta and the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum are located in the 131-acre park'' part of Grant Park, and the neighborhood is close to all of Atlanta's downtown attractions, including Turner Field, Philips Arena, the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, CNN Center and the Georgia Aquarium. The area is served by several bus lines. Grant Park is one of the most historic areas of the city. It was named for Lemuel P. Grant, a civil engineer known as the Father of Atlanta'' for his role in bringing the railroad to Atlanta. Grant lived in a mansion in the middle of a huge estate, most of which he eventually donated to the city. Part of his estate became Grant Park, Atlanta's first public park. An earthen breastwork from a Civil War fort remains in the park today. The remains of Lemuel Grant's 1858 mansion still survive; the home is now owned by the Atlanta Preservation Center and is being restored. During the 1890s, the area surrounding the park was developed as one of Atlanta's early suburbs. Victorian and Craftsman-style homes fill the neighborhood, which flourished until the 1960s, when Interstate 20 was built, bisecting Grant Park. The highway disrupted the growth of the area, which went into decline. In the late 1970s, urban pioneers'' began to return, restoring homes and breathing new life into Grant Park, a process which continues today. The area was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Some of the attractions and features of Grant Park include: Grant Park itself. The 131-acre park is one of Atlanta's most beautiful green spaces, with walking paths among rolling hills and graceful, old trees, as well as a new playground, pool and baseball/soccer field.

Atlanta's most historic cemetery is one of the most underrated attractions in the city, featuring beautiful monuments and some of Atlanta's most prominent citizens from the last 150 years. Grant Park is still a neighborhood in transition. Twenty years ago, it was crime-ridden and blighted, with businesses and homeowners struggling to hang on. Now it is an eclectic, diverse area with the occasional trendy restaurant, new business development and ongoing restoration of older homes. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution notes that a host of casual eateries and lively pubs that appeal to the neighborhood's young families have fostered the rejuvenation of the community.'' The Grant Park Summer Shade Festival in late August offers live music on three stages, a 5K run, an artist's market and Corks and Forks,'' which features the food of local chefs and wine tastings. Every September brings the Tour of Homes, which showcases not only the area's lovely historic homes, but new construction that fits Grant Park's innovative yet respectful take on its long history."
"Great Waters at Reynolds Plantation","Georgia","Great Waters at Reynolds Plantation, Greensboro, Georgia - One of the Best of Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Courses","The Great Waters Course at Reynolds Plantation is a Jack Nicklaus-designed course that ranks among his very best efforts. According to Nicklaus, the first time he saw Great Waters, he knew the venue had the potential to have a great golf course, but first he had to find it. According to Nicklaus, he thinks he did. I think we have a great balance on the golf course. I think we have great tree-lined holes. We have great water holes. We've utilized the lake to a large degree for some of the difficulty of the holes. But we've also taken the holes and utilized the lake for view and kept the holes off of it. It's one of the really great pieces of property that I've ever had the opportunity to work with.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 1992, plays to 7,048 yards from the tips, with a USGA course rating of 73.8 and a slope rating of 135 on Bermuda grass. The course provides the customary risk-reward challenges of a Nicklaus design, as well as some of the most stunning golf scenery found in the Southeast. The front nine features tight fairways and lots of bunkers, with fast, tough-to-read greens, while the back nine takes full advantage of the Lake Oconee shoreline, with all nine of its holes playing along the shores of the lake. The course is considered the prettiest of the Reynolds Plantation six golf courses, and the nine of the holes on the back half of the course are particularly appealing, with each having expansive views of the lake. From its opening, the course created a rush of excitement in the golfing community, and the accolades and honors have followed. Golf Magazine ranked the Great Waters Course No. 5 among the Top 10 Nicklaus Golf Courses You Can Play,'' while GolfWeek Magazine ranked it among America's Best Residential Golf Courses.'' As further testament, the course, along with Reynolds Landing, hosted the 41st PGA Professional National Championship in 2008, which is a showcase event for PGA Professionals.

The mall is located on Interstate 85, the major northeast corridor out of the city. Gwinnett Place was built in 1984, the same year that Gwinnett County was first named the fastest growing county in the nation. With a population over 700,000, Gwinnett County is still a national leader in growth, as well as economic strength. The mall remained the largest in the county for many years, until two other super-regional malls opened nearby in 1999 and 2001. With competition from other malls, Gwinnett Place suffered economically, most notably with the loss of Rich's, their lead anchor, in 2003. The other anchors - Macy's, Sears, Belk's, and JCPenney - remain open. Although the prospects for Gwinnett Place seemed dim for several years, since 2007, the mall has had a flurry of good news: In 2007, Sears opened the prototype of their new retail concept at Gwinnett Place. The new Sears is designed to create a warmer, more upscale'' environment. In response to an increasingly diverse population, the mall has leased space to new stores including the Churro Factory, It Is Soccer and African Hair Braiding. The crime rate in the mall area has decreased steadily in the past year-and-a-half due to increased police presence and retailer vigilance. In the Fall of 2009, Gwinnett Place will welcome M International Market Place, a Korean shopping concept that is opening its first store in the U.S. at Gwinnett Place. M International Market Place promises to be nothing like anything the Atlanta area has seen before. The three-level store will have high-end groceries, luxury retail goods, and fine dining, all with an international flavor. The addition of this tenant may return Gwinnett Place to its former level of success as a super-regional mall. Indeed, Gwinnett Place Mall offers a retail experience unlike many other malls in the metro Atlanta area. It is home to such mainstream stores as Abercrombie & Fitch, Aeropostale, and FOSSIL, but, in response the changing demographics of its clientele, the mall has added new offerings. The Churro Factory, African Hair Braiding, El Caballo Ballo Western Wear and Bad Boyz Barbershop, while not traditional mall stores, fit very comfortably into the mix of retailers here. Another addition to Gwinnett Place is the International Education Center, a unit of Gwinnett Technical College, one of the fastest growing technical colleges in the nation. The center will be operational in the Fall of 2009 and will feature continuing education classes, workforce training courses and language assistance geared toward the area's multilingual population. A major complaint about the Gwinnett Place Mall area for years has been traffic. The interchange onto I-85 creates a bottleneck, and there is no public transportation to the mall except for a bus line. The Gwinnett Place Community Improvement District, a neighborhood improvement board, is working with the Georgia Department of Transportation to redesign the interchange in order to help traffic flow more freely. There is also talk of light rail coming to the mall in the future. These improvements will continue to enhance the resurgence of Gwinnett Place as an area destination."

"High Museum of Art: Atlanta's Premier Fine Art Collection","Georgia","High Museum of Art: Atlanta's Premier Fine Art Collection","The High Museum of Art is considered the premier fine arts collection in the Southeast. The museum is located in Midtown Atlanta. Nearby attractions include Piedmont Park, the Atlanta Botanical Garden, Atlantic Station and the Center for Puppetry Arts. The museum is easily reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's rapid transit system, serves the museum with a bus line and a train station. The High began in 1905 in the private home of Mrs. Joseph High. In 1955, the museum moved to a brick building next door to her home. Finally, in 1983, the collection was given a home worthy of it, in a stunning, modern 135,000-square-foot building designed by Richard Meier. The American Institute of Architects named the building one of the Top Ten Buildings of the 1980s.'' In 2005, the museum grew again, this time into a three-building expansion designed by renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, which more than doubled the size of the museum. No less an authority than the director of the Louvre, Henri Loyrette, who was on hand for the opening of the Piano buildings, exclaimed, ''It's marvelous and really a new museum.'' The original Meier building and the Piano expansion complement each other nicely. The Los Angeles Times says, It is hard to think of another American example where connected buildings by two prominent architects get along so well.'' The traditional core of the High's 11,000-item collection is its 19th- and 20th-century American art, which features American Impressionists, painters of the Hudson River School, and pieces by artists such as Joseph Stella and Georgia O'Keeffe. The museum is becoming known, however, for its European collection - it recently acquired major works by Mary Cassatt, Camille Pissarro, Pierre Bonnard, and Ydouard Vuillard. Another important and growing collection is Southern Folk Art. The museum, according to its website, is the only major museum in North America to have a full-time curator specifically devoted to the field of folk and self-taught art.'' Major artists in the collection include the Reverend Howard Finster, Mattie Lou O'Kelley, Thornton Dial and William Hawkins. The High also has collections of African art, the decorative arts and design, photography and contemporary art. The High Museum announced in 2006 that it was beginning a three-year partnership with the Louvre in Paris, a project that would bring some of the French museum's finest works to Atlanta. The Chicago Tribune noted, perhaps a bit jealously, The Paris museum has never allowed so much of its collection to be lent out for such a long period.'' The article says, It was a bold experiment for Atlanta,'' and, indeed, the experiment paid off. The museum's attendance and memberships are higher than they have ever been. Although the partnership ended in September of 2009, director Michael Shapiro said in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, We don't believe our relationship with the Louvre will end.'' The High is almost always a stop for major traveling exhibitions, as well, like the recent The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army.'' The High also presents a film series offering classics, independents, and international films, such as the recent 12-film series Treasures from India.''  Educational efforts from the High include lectures, live music, a children's gallery, Family Fun Days and lesson plans for teachers. Reviewers of the High Museum on travel websites have mixed feelings. One New Yorker said, The collection is small but we enjoyed it very much.'' Another visitor thought their collection was lacking, it felt empty.'' Many people visited the museum during crowded special exhibits and complained that the lines and crowds were poorly organized and controlled. Those visitors who acknowledge that the High is a growing collection, not an established institution like those found in New York or Boston, seem pleased with the variety and quality of the works, and the architecture is universally a hit."

Hotel Indigo is a new hotel concept - Atlanta was the first location - that aims to bring luxury and upscale amenities to guests at a bargain price. The hotel features wood floors, glassed-in showers and seasonally changing artwork, design options usually only found in very expensive boutique'' hotels. Owned by the InterContinental Hotel Group (IHG), the Hotel Indigo fills a critical gap ... by addressing middle-market consumers who are trading up to higher levels of quality and taste, but still seeking value,'' says IHG's Americas President Steve Porter. According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the company has likened the concept to Target's lines of housewares and clothing designed by Michael Graves and Isaac Mizrahi.'' The hotel's 140 rooms are small but bright and airy, with playful colors. Amenities are standard but comfortable, with plush bedding, Aveda bath products and teak benches in the showers. Every room has complementary high-speed, wired Internet access. Wireless access is only available in the hotel's common areas.

The other major complaint is the size of the bathrooms, which were not able to be redesigned from the original plumbing of the building.

The permanent exhibits are: Fundamentally Food - An area where children learn the basics of food production, transportation, shopping and cooking Let Your Creativity Flow - Painting on the wall, sand sculpting, dancing and other expressive activities go on here Tools for Solutions - Children must manipulate a rolling ball using a variety of tools Leaping into Learning - Splash tables and tree houses await younger visitors in this area Crawl Space - For crawlers and early walkers, an area with soft toys and padding blocks for climbing and exploring In 2009, the three rotating exhibits were The Amazing Castle, in which children got to explore a castle and interact with the characters who might live there; Exploring Trees Inside and Out, in which children could crawl around inside an oversized tree and discover its inner workings; and Curious George: Let's Get Curious!, which used science, math and engineering to solve problems. In addition to their exhibits, the museum offers live interaction throughout the day. The Imaginators, a troupe of performers and educators, read stories, enact plays related to a theme in the museum, play music and dance with children. The museum also offers day camps, music classes and other workshops for various interest groups. An important part of the museum's mission is to make sure that all children have access to the Imagine It! experience. To further this mission, the museum has Target Free Days one day a month, during which children may visit the museum free of charge. The Imagine It! Express is a bio-diesel bus that will pick children up whose schools cannot afford to take them to the museum. Finally, the Imaginators will take their shows on the road and go out to schools, although this service is not free of charge. Internet reviews of Imagine It! are mostly positive, although several there are several recurring negatives in the comments. Many visitors think it is overpriced at $11 and that it could be bigger. On the other hand, one woman says, My 18-month-old son LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this place! ... for $11 it was a great deal.'' The large groups of schoolchildren during weekdays bother some visitors, and others complain that the space is frequently a mess. However, most parents say that, despite their own concerns, their children had a great time."
"Inman Park","Georgia","Inman Park","Inman Park is a historic park roughly two miles to the east of downtown Atlanta, Georgia. It was and is part of Atlanta's first planned communities. It was also one of the first garden suburbs allowing the park to be on the national register of historic places. Inman Park has a long history including the Battle of Atlanta where the park was part of skirmishes during the Civil War. The actual residential area and park was not officially planned until the 1880s by Joel hurt. In 1910 Inman Park was declining due to zoning restrictions and motor cars. The glory of the park and district were almost gone by the 1950s.  In the 1970s Inman Park Restoration Project was started in order to renovate the older homes and restore the community to its old glory. It took a couple of years for the park to be restored and it helped that it was finally added to the registry of historic places. There are now 300 homes that have or are being renovated. There is a garden club and festivals held in the park in order to promote community. It is considered a Small Town Downtown with no crime and tumble down homes of the past."
"Inman Park: Atlanta's First Suburb","Georgia","Inman Park: Atlanta's First Suburb","Inman Park, the first planned suburb of Atlanta, is located about two miles east of downtown Atlanta. The area is easily reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and Interstate 20. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station in the neighborhood, which is also served by several bus lines.  Inman Park is convenient to all of downtown Atlanta's attractions, including Turner Field, the Georgia Dome, Philips Arena, the King Center, Oakland Cemetery and Zoo Atlanta. Although a massive Civil War battle once raged on the same land, the urban history of Inman Park did not really begin until the 1880s, when Atlanta developer and entrepreneur Joel Hurt decided to create a rural, garden environment for residents of Atlanta who were tired of the hectic, crowded city. The result was one of the nation's first planned communities, a garden suburb'' with large lots, parks landscaped with exotic plants and pleasantly curving streets. Hurt developed an electric streetcar line to connect Inman Park with downtown Atlanta. Construction started in 1889, and the neighborhood became immediately popular. Atlanta's leading residents built mansions, including the Candlers, the Hurts and the Woodruffs, the city's titans of the Gilded Age. Many streets were occupied, however, by working people in smaller, more practical homes. However, Atlanta's rapid growth caused the suburb to become unfashionable. By the 1950s, Inman Park was all but abandoned for newer areas further from the center of town. In the 1970s, young, adventurous urban pioneers'' rediscovered the architectural wonders of Inman Park and began renovating and reinvigorating the neighborhood. From elaborate, turreted Queen Anne mansions to small, Craftsman-style bungalows, the homes in this neighborhood became some of the most coveted in Atlanta. The area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated as a historic district under the city's Comprehensive Historic Preservation Program, giving its 300 homes and other historic structures important local protection from demolition and obtrusive or inappropriate development. Inman Park has an active neighborhood association that sponsors the annual Spring Festival and Tour of Homes every April. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution calls the festival one of the most celebrated, and eclectic, of Atlanta's many outdoor springtime soirees.'' The festival, which takes place over two days, includes parades, live music, a street market and a juried arts and crafts show. The Tour of Homes, one of the most popular in Atlanta, showcases not only the mansions, but many smaller homes that have been lovingly restored, as well as newer homes that maintain the spirit of the neighborhood. Inman Park offers a mix of history, on view today in its beautiful homes and parks, and hip, urban sophistication. The neighborhood is filled with bed and breakfast inns, including the King-Keith House, an elaborate Victorian fantasy in pink and blue; and the Urban Oasis, a funky, ultra-modern loft. Restaurants include Son's Place, featuring soul food like fried chicken and collards; and the cutting-edge Rathbun's, which the Atlanta Journal-Constitution calls arguably the most popular restaurant in the city,'' featuring, for example, chicken livers a la plancha with fig molasses. These contrasts exemplify what is special about Inman Park - it served as a model for suburban development and stylish living in 1890; now, the neighborhood is an example of urban preservation, renovation and the spirit of renewal."

It is a historical monument because it was fashioned in 1954. The Iron Horse is 12 feet tall. It weighs in at one ton. It was part of the Reed Hall Quadrangle. It was built at Lamar Dodd School of Art as a piece of abstract art. The designer was Abbott Pattison. He visited the University that year and decided to create the Iron Horse. A crowd gathered when it was unveiled.  Due to the crowd that formed with some bad intentions, the fire department was called for crowd control. A day later the horse was moved from the university. The location was not disclosed, but it was eventually found that the horse was placed on LC Curtis Farm. He was a professor of agriculture at the time. Up until the 1980s, there were a lot of movements to try to get the horse back to the campus, but these failed. The grandson of LC Curtis said he would not allow it to be moved back to campus as it does more good where it is."

"Jepson Center for the Arts: Savannah's Contemporary Cultural Center","Georgia","Jepson Center for the Arts: Savannah's Contemporary Cultural Center","The Jepson Center for the Arts is the new expansion of the Telfair Museum of Art. It is located in the historic district of downtown Savannah about five blocks from the Riverfront to the north and five blocks from the end of Interstate 16 to the south. It is adjacent to the older building belonging to the museum, the Telfair Academy, and is connected to it by two bridges. The museum is on the western end of the historic district. Most of the district is within walking distance, but some attractions on the eastern end may require transportation. The Telfair Museum of Art is purported to be the oldest public art museum in the country. By the 1990s, it was clear that the older building was running out of space, both in terms of storage for their expanding collection and of gallery space large enough to contain contemporary pieces. The museum also felt that its educational capabilities were lacking. A major mission of the Telfair is outreach to youth in Savannah, and the museum felt that opportunities were being missed. To solve these problems, a new building was commissioned from world-renowned Israeli-Canadian architect Moshe Safdie that would expand the Telfair's space by 66 percent. Safdie designed a 64,000-square-foot, soaring structure with hung-glass ceilings, a stone fazade, cantilevered walls on the inside and natural light throughout. The building not only contains much more gallery space, but also includes a 200-seat auditorium, a 3,500-square-foot children's ArtZeum, a cafy, classrooms, outdoor sculpture terraces and a museum store. There are galleries designed especially for Southern art, African-American art and photography. The Jepson Center opened in March 2006. Safdie's design was not without its detractors. Many in the local community who treasure Savannah's historical beauty thought the contemporary design would be an eyesore. Construction was held up while the issue was discussed, and Safdie made some changes to the fazade to satisfy local aesthetic guidelines. Diane Lesko, former executive director of the Telfair, defended the design, saying, There were some who really felt this building had no business being in Savannah. But we felt that we could counter that argument. If you are building in the 20th century, to build a 19th century building is a fake. We're in a different age now.'' A very popular part of the Jepson Center is the ArtZeum, the hands-on, interactive, two-story gallery designed for children but equally popular with adults. Board games, a magnetic sculpture wall, hats that teach about types of columns and art-sleuthing computer games are a few of the activities that delight families. The ArtZeum's mission is to engage children with art and teach them that art is for everyone. The adjacent classrooms, equipped with state-of-the-art teaching aids, assist the ArtZeum in carrying out its community goals. Now that the furor over the building's design has died down, reaction to the Jepson Center for the Arts is largely positive. Those who do not care for contemporary architecture or art find it cold,'' but most visitors are inspired by the open, naturally-lit spaces and the challenging art within. The ArtZeum gets rave reviews, including this one: My niece absolutely LOVED the ArtZeum ... An educational, fun, artsy kids' activity in Savannah - a gem!'' And for contemporary art lovers, this commenter summed it up, saying, If I was wearing socks at the time, I think it would be fair to say the Jepson would have rocked them off!''"

"Juliette Gordon Low's Birthplace: Savannah's Home of the Girl Scouts","Georgia","Juliette Gordon Low's Birthplace: Savannah's Home of the Girl Scouts","Juliette Gordon Low's Birthplace, the home where the founder of the Girl Scouts grew up, is in the Historic District of downtown Savannah. The home is in the northern half of the District, near the Jepson Center for the Arts, the Owens-Thomas House, Riverfront Plaza and the City Market. CAT, Savannah's public transit system, has a free downtown shuttle that stops in front of the home. Juliette Gordon, or Daisy,'' as she was called, was born in Savannah in 1860 to a well-to-do family. As a child and young woman, she traveled extensively. In 1886, she married William Mackay Low, the son of Andrew Low, one of the wealthiest merchants in Savannah. They moved to England where Low eventually left Daisy for another woman. Before their divorce was complete in 1905, he died, and she inherited his fortune. In 1911, she met Sir Robert Paden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts. She was inspired to return to America and found a similar organization for girls and young women. In 1912, the Girl Scouts were born in Savannah. By the time she died 15 years later, there were Girl Scouts and Girl Guides in 30 countries around the world. The house where Daisy grew up was built between 1818 and 1821 in the Regency style. Some attribute the house to architect William Jay, who designed the Owens-Thomas House, considered one of the finest examples of Regency architecture in America. The house was built for James Moore Wayne, a prominent Savannah attorney who later became a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. He sold the house to William and Sarah Gordon, who would become Daisy's grandparents. Four generations of Gordons would live in the house. The Girl Scouts bought the house in 1953; it was the first house in Savannah to be awarded National Historic Landmark status. Today, at the Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace, the house is maintained as a museum of the life of this remarkable woman. The home has been meticulously restored as it was in 1886, the year Daisy got married as well as the year a major addition was built onto the house. Preservation is one of their missions, but their collections of Low's writings and belongings, including her artwork, inform the study of her life and the founding of the Girl Scouts. The organization balances the preservation of the house with their educational mission to girls and young women. A large archive is available for research, as are student and teacher learning packages. The director of the museum said in the Savannah Morning News, `We're trying to attract a new customer, particularly conventioneers.' The only way they can go to a museum, after attending a convention all day, is after the traditional hours.'' To that end, the Low Birthplace offers special evening guided tours, as well as an expanded web presence. Internet reviews of the museum are very positive. It was the highlight of our trip!'' raved one visitor. It is a pilgrimage for Girl Scouts, but even non-Scouts love the house. One woman said, Of all the home tours we did, this was by far the most interesting story of a person. The house is wonderful to look at, but Juliette's story is great.'' This person says it best: Girl Scout or not, this is a great house to visit.''"

The mall included a grocery store, bowling alley and gas station. Designed by Atlanta's most prominent proponent of modernist architecture, Joseph Amisano, Lenox featured flying concrete arches and wings, giving it a space-age'' air. All the original architecture is now lost. The outdoor shopping plaza was enclosed in 1972, and Lenox has continued to expand ever since.

In the mid-1970s, Little Five began a comeback, this time as an alternative neighborhood. A local business owner, quoted in Creative Loafing, notes, For three decades, Little Five Points has been ground zero for alternative Atlanta.'' At first, the area was only for the hard-core denizens of the alternative lifestyle. Over the years, the area has mellowed and gentrified, but not to the point of becoming generic. Frommer's says, There are still authentic hippies here - and enough young people with wildly colored hair and pierced body parts to give you a '60s flashback.''

Little Five Points also offers great dining, from the most contemporary gourmet cuisine at Kevin Rathbun Steak, to the best burgers in town at the Vortex, to the Euclid Avenue Yacht Club, one of Details magazine's Best Dive Bars in America.'' There's plenty more shopping - Junkman's Daughter sells, well, junk, and Sevananda is a health-food cooperative - and of course, people watching is always entertaining in Little Five. Most reviewers on the Internet appreciate the neighborhood that the New York Times calls Greenwich Village with peach trees.'' One person says, A good way to spend an afternoon if you appreciate the alternative scene.'' Another calls it a great, little eclectic community.'' Some visitors are uncomfortable here, with both the shopping venues and the crowd, but those who get it,'' as one reviewer said, will have a great time. If you're looking for a compact, vibrant neighborhood with great restaurants ... and a good night life scene if you want to avoid loud, big-city dance clubs,'' then Little Five Points is perfect."

The mall itself is located on U.S. Highway 27, the major north-south route through the city. The mall's primary trade area includes over 300,000 people. Built in 1991, the nearly half-a-million-square-foot mall is anchored by Belk, JCPenney and Sears. There is one anchor location currently not leased. Mount Berry Square's other tenants are a mix of national retailers and local stores, many of whom cater to the town's large population of college students. Aeropostale, American Eagle, Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works are a few of the nationally known brands in the mall. Smaller, younger-trending retailers include Skatelife, Hot Topix, Claire's Accessories and Justice. There is also a cinema at the mall that is undergoing renovation. Work is expected to be complete by the Fall of 2009. Mount Berry Square Mall is not just a center for retail and entertainment. Lori Wilcoxon, the general manager of the mall's local management team, says, We try to be a community center.'' The mall sponsors a Home-Based Business Show, which highlights products and services for owners of home-based businesses, and the Back-to-School Healthy Living Expo, which addresses health issues for the whole family. The county school system puts on an art show at Mount Berry Square, and regional artisans show their work at an arts and crafts fair. Wilcoxon says that, despite the economic downturn, the community responds well to the mall's promotions. Some retailers go out into the community. For instance, Belk sponsors a Dress for Success'' fashion show at one of the local colleges. The mall's previous owner, the Lightstone Group, defaulted on their loan on the property, and the mall went into receivership in January 2009. The receiver, Jones Lang LaSalle, is looking for both national and regional tenants for the mall and has already found four or five'' new stores. More of a threat to the older mall, however, are the new retail developments planned around town. Although the economy has placed most new development on hold, mall management worries that newer retail shopping venues could hurt the nearly 30-year-old Mount Berry Square. Rome is a very successful smaller city. It has been named the Number One Small City in the Southeast and the 12th Most Livable City in the United States by The New Rating Guide to Life in America's Small Cities. It is home to Berry College, one of the top liberal arts in the country, and its medical care is also ranked among the highest in the nation for small cities. The question for Mount Berry Square Mall is not whether the city can support a shopping center of its size, but whether it will survive the new competition that is sure to come when the economy recovers."
"Muffler Man","Georgia","Muffler Man","The Muffler Man is not an auto repair shop as the name sounds, but an actual statue built in Atlanta, Georgia. According to one description it is a tire holding Bunyan with alien blue eyes. In fact the statue is a lot like Bunyan in size and lumberjack appearance. The eyes are definitely one of the most vibrant features painted all blue rather than having irises of blue.  Muffler Man is located at 3495 Norman Berry Drive. This address is technically East Point, Georgia as part of Atlanta. To get there visitors need to take I85 South from Atlanta. Take Virginia Avenue exit heading east. One then needs to turn left past the McDonald's on that road. Then head left across from the Red Roof Inn which is the entrance for the Boyd Tire Company. The tire company has the statue standing at the entrance to their parking area and shop. It is fairly easy to find. Muffler Man is dressed in blue jeans, a red shirt, and yellow hat. His face has a beard and mustache. As a slim statue with broad shoulders and lean body it definitely reminds you of a lumberjack despite the tire held in the statue's hand."

The museum utilizes the Georgia Performance Standards into the lessons so teachers can easily incorporate visits to the museum into their classroom lessons and programs. Two of the most poplar pieces in the permanent collection are Zygorhiza, a creature that lived in Georgia 40 million years ago. Ziggy, as the creature is called at the museum, features a small shark in its rib cage, enabling visitors to look into the re-sculpted bones of the creature and view its final dinner. The Gesturing Woman is a piece of art created by Viloa Frey in 1933 with commercial glazes. "

"National Museum of Patriotism","Georgia","National Museum of Patriotism","The National Museum of Patriotism was founded by Nicholas Snider. He was a retired UPS executive with a collection of sweetheart jewelry. The museum is located in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2010, the museum announced it would change its mission and be known as the National Foundation of Patriotism. What this meant was for the physical museum to close and the museum to become an online location only.  The website stated the economic downturn has forced the museum to offer its collection online only rather than in a brick and mortar building. They have not received enough visitors, vendors, or fundraisers to keep the museum open. It is also the reason for the new name as the National Foundation of Patriotism over the National Museum of Patriotism. As a virtual museum it can be visited whether one is in Atlanta or not. It means one can go online to walk around the exhibits in the virtual world, zooming in on the pieces to get a better look and continuing on. They hope to get a higher impact with visitors than a building in a city could ever obtain. They intend on using social media as one means of advertisement to drive the virtual museum."

"North Dekalb Mall: One of Decatur's Oldest Shopping Centers","Georgia","North Dekalb Mall: One of Decatur's Oldest Shopping Centers","North Dekalb Mall is located in north-central Dekalb County, the third largest county in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The mall is near the intersection of Interstate 285, Atlanta's beltway, and two major commuter routes, Lawrenceville Highway (U.S. Hwy. 29) and Stone Mountain Freeway (U.S. Hwy. 78). The 635,000-square-foot mall has a primary trade area of approximately 650,000 people. It is not considered a regional mall. North Dekalb is near Emory University, in the midst of older, well-established middle-class neighborhoods. It is served by numerous bus routes. Built in 1965, North Dekalb Mall is one of the oldest malls in the Atlanta area. It was originally anchored by the legendary, now-defunct, Atlanta-based department store, Rich's. Rich's was absorbed by Macy's, which is still the lead anchor of the mall. Other anchors include Burlington Coat Factory, Ross Dress for Less and Payless Home Furnishings. One of the newest retailers in the mall is the Obama Store, a store devoted solely to Obama paraphernalia. Many of the other stores in the mall are discounters. There is also a 16-screen cinema at North Dekalb. The mall's sales have lagged over the years as newer, larger malls and power centers have opened nearby . It underwent a major expansion and renovation in 1986, adding anchors and restaurants that differentiated it from other Atlanta malls. Even the name of mall changed for a few years. After a brief period of success, however, these new anchors failed, leading to a merry-go-round of stores arriving and almost immediately leaving the mall. Despite a major renovation to the mall in 2004, retailers continue to leave, and the mall's vacancy rate remains high. The owner of the property has tried for several years bring warehouse discounter Costco to North Dekalb, but he has not yet succeeded. Costco may be the last hope for the mall. If the warehouse store does open, one plan suggests that the entire mall be redesigned into an open streetscape,'' a concept currently popular in retail. Despite the mall's flagging sales, it remains a vibrant part of the community, even if the community is not actually shopping there. While many malls have morning walking programs for senior citizens, North Dekalb's is special. The mall partners with nearby Dekalb Medical Center in a program called Walkabout. Walkabout includes an educational component with informal talks about health. Walkers are able to log the number of miles they have walked, and prizes are given for reaching goals. Another extremely popular event at the mall is North Dekalb Mall Idol. Based on the television show American Idol,'' the competition features vocalists from three different age groups competing for prizes and free recording studio time. North Dekalb Mall Idol started in 2006; Youth Idol, the competition for ages eight to fifteen, is so popular that the mall has had to expand the competition. Reviews of the mall in the blogosphere are generally not kind. The cinema garners praise as being, generally, in better condition than the mall itself. As a matter of fact, many users enjoy their movie-going experience at North Dekalb because it is much less crowded than most Atlanta theatres."
"North Point Mall: North Atlanta's Premier Shopping Destination","Georgia","North Point Mall: North Atlanta's Premier Shopping Destination","North Point Mall is a super-regional mall located in Alpharetta, Georgia, a northern suburban of Atlanta. The mall is about 25 miles north of downtown Atlanta just off Georgia Highway 400, the major commuter route to the north of the city. North Point is in North Fulton County, one of the most affluent areas in the metropolitan Atlanta area. The primary trade area, which includes over 600,000 people, is growing at four times the rate of the U.S. population. More than four times as many people in the trade area are in the most affluent income group as in the U.S. at large. The nearly 1.4-million-square-foot mall is currently anchored by Dillard's, JCPenney, Macy's, Sears and Belk, although Belk has announced that it is leaving the mall around Labor Day 2009 because of that particular store's underperformance. Built in 1993, North Point Mall has been a destination mall since it opened. Until recently, there was very little retail directly north of Atlanta, so the mall has traditionally drawn from all of north Georgia and parts of Tennessee and Alabama. Several popular restaurants are inside the mall, including the California Pizza Kitchen and the Cheesecake Factory. Among the stores that draw the most customers are Apple, Coach and Lucky. The mall's food court was completely renovated in 2008. North Point has always been known as a family-friendly destination. The new food court includes a carousel, and a soft play area has also been recently added. The primary attraction for young people, however, is the American Girl Boutique and Bistro. The store is only American Girl's sixth retail outlet in the country, and it is the first boutique concept that the company has opened. The Bistro is a popular location for theme parties. The boutique draws 20 percent of its customers from more than 200 miles away, a very unusual statistic for a regional mall. In fact, the store has recorded customers from all 50 states. The store draws so many customers from out of town that local hotels offer American Girl packages,'' which can include turn-down service for the dolls. North Point also hosts events that entertain the whole family, as well as educational expos that benefit the community. For instance, Rock Ur Style is a Rockband'' video game contest for children and teens. The annual Women's Expo targets professional women. An annual car show sponsored by a local fraternal organization provides entertainment for the entire family. The mall's owner, General Growth Properties, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, but the bankruptcy is not expected to affect North Point Mall. C. Whitney Knoll, a manager at an Atlanta commercial real estate firm, says, I think it makes no difference to [North Point] if they go bankrupt.'' Indeed, the mall's customers give it almost uniformly good reviews. The mall has the best selection of stores I've ever seen!'' raved one shopper. Another says, This is the north side of town's `soccer mom mecca' for a reason.'' Even if General Growth is forced to sell North Point, the mall itself will continue to thrive."
"Northlake Mall: Tucker, Georgia's Center for Retail","Georgia","Northlake Mall: Tucker, Georgia's Center for Retail","Northlake Mall is located in Tucker, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb approximately 12 miles northeast of downtown. Northlake is located on Interstate 285, Atlanta's beltway, near U.S. Highway 29 and U.S. Highway 78, two major commuter routes out of the city. It is also easily accessible from Interstate 85, which runs northeast from Atlanta. The mall's primary trade area includes over half-a-million people. The population of the trade area is neither as educated nor as affluent as that of many other Atlanta malls. Northlake was built in 1971. It was renovated and expanded in 1994 and now contains almost one million square feet of shopping and restaurants. The original anchors were Sears, JCPenney and Davison's, a now-defunct Atlanta department store. The 1994 expansion created space for another anchor, and the mall is now anchored by JCPenney, Macy's, Sears and Kohl's. Other tenants include nationally known retailers like Charlotte, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works and The Men's Wearhouse. Smaller stores that appeal to the local market include Foot Locker, Finish Line, Man Alive, Underground Station and GameStop. Kohl's came to Northlake Mall in 2008, the first time that store has located in an Atlanta area mall. (Most of Atlanta's Kohl's locations are in power centers,'' where the customer can park and go directly into the store.) The Atlanta Business Chronicle notes: The move reflects a number of changes in the makeup of Atlanta's malls. Once primarily the domain of full-service department stores, malls are changing in the wake of numerous retail mergers and the growth of discounters.'' Northlake Mall is host to a number of educational and entertaining events. The PROBE College Fair gives students an opportunity to speak with many different college recruiters in one venue. The Dekalb Fire & Safety Show, sponsored by the Dekalb County Fire Department, gives safety tips to homeowners. Trick-or-Treat Northlake gives youngsters a safe environment to trick-or-treat on Halloween. Perhaps the most entertaining of all the Northlake events is the monthly Dine & Dance Tuesdays. On the last Tuesday of every month, a big band performs in the Food Court of the mall. Customers are invited to dine at the food court and dance, for no charge, as long as the band plays. Northlake is a declining mall. The addition of Kohl's breathed a little bit of new life into the shopping center, but reviews of the mall are generally negative, citing concerns about crime, cleanliness and the unsatisfying mix of stores. One customer on a popular review site says, This is an 80s mall that seems to have never been updated ... there isn't much you'd want to buy.'' However, others appreciate the virtues of a mall that has fewer visitors. When I don't feel like fighting the crowd at [another Atlanta mall] ... then I head here.'' I did all my Christmas shopping here in one day!'' The new Kohl's and the many bargains available also attract some shoppers. Perhaps the overall attitude toward the mall is summed up by this customer, who says, [Northlake] is sufficient and convenient for locals.''"
"Northside Tavern","Georgia","Northside Tavern","The Northside Tavern is one place to find nightlife in Atlanta, Georgia. The tavern is a blues club that is open seven nights a week with live music over DJs and other options. The building is at 1058 Howell Mill Road Northwest. Mr. Frank Edwards, a blues musician that lived from 1909 to 2002 said, The Blues is the biggest music group. Sean Costello (1979-2008) said The Northside is like Home. Both played at the Northside Tavern. The tavern presents weekends and special events with cover charges on Fridays and Saturdays of $10 unless noted otherwise at the door or with the event. Music always begins at 10pm Monday through Saturday, and at 9pm on Sundays.  The Northside was started in the 1940s as a grocery store and gas station. Eventually it became a blue collar bar named the Northside Package. It was a popular spot that evolved into a Blues bar and club over the years. The original owner's daughter, Ellen Webb has owned the club since 1989, which is when it was converted into the Blue's club. Before that her father Butler ran it as a bar with some music. The family was notable in Atlanta politics, but Webb opted for a bar instead."
"Oakland Cemetery: Atlanta's Most Historic Resting Place","Georgia","Oakland Cemetery: Atlanta's Most Historic Resting Place","Oakland Cemetery, the final sanctuary of many of Atlanta's most important figures, is located about one mile east of downtown Atlanta. It can be reached easily from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and Interstate 20. Atlanta's rapid transit system, MARTA, has a train station within walking distance, and the cemetery is also served by numerous bus lines. The area is a short ride from all of downtown Atlanta's attractions, as well as Turner Field, Zoo Atlanta and the Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum. Oakland is the oldest major cemetery in the Atlanta area. The first six acres were purchased by the city in 1850, and, by 1867, the cemetery had reached its present size of 48 acres.  Over 70,000 people are buried there, including many great figures from Atlanta's history, but also many of the city's poor and unknown. By 1884, all the lots were sold out, although the City of Atlanta and many individual families still have space and continue to use the cemetery. There are several distinct sections in Oakland, including the Jewish sections, the African-American Grounds and the Confederate Memorial Grounds. Oakland was planned and nurtured in the style of the rural garden cemetery.'' This movement, begun in the 1830s, was designed to make cemeteries into beautiful areas where visitors could commune with nature in peaceful reflection, rather than the morbid, uninviting graveyards'' of tradition. After the Civil War, the cemetery became a popular place for Sunday afternoon carriage rides and family picnics. Family plots were tended lovingly and planted with beautiful gardens. In the 20th century, the cemetery was slowly allowed to fall into disrepair. Only in 1976, when Oakland Cemetery was listed in the National Register of Historic Places and the Historic Oakland Foundation was formed, did the cemetery begin its rehabilitation into a garden and place of repose again. A list of who is buried in Oakland reads like an Atlanta history book, literally from the beginning. The town was named Marthasville from 1843 to 1845 for a governor's daughter, and Martha Lumpkin Compton, the'' Martha of Atlanta history, lies in the cemetery. Other notables in Oakland include: Margaret Mitchell, Pulitzer-Prize-winning author of Gone With The Wind Bobby Jones, one of the greatest golfers of all time Ivan Allen Jr., mayor of Atlanta from 1962 to 1970, who saw Atlanta through much of the social turmoil of the Civil Rights era Maynard Jackson, the first African American mayor of Atlanta, who oversaw much of the city's modern-era dynamic economic growth Carrie Steele Logan, an ex-slave who took home African-American orphans from the train station where she worked as a maid and eventually founded one of the first predominantly African-American orphanages in the country Twenty-three other Atlanta mayors Six Georgia governors Approximately 6,900 Confederate soldiers Approximately 17,000 indigent and other unknown inhabitants Today, the Historic Oakland Foundation has turned the cemetery's gardens and monuments into a place of recreation again, just as it was originally intended. The cemetery's gates are open year-round during the day, and Atlanta residents use the site as a park - jogging, walking the dog and playing Frisbee. Volunteers provide guided, themed tours on weekends throughout most of the year. Topics of the tours include the history, art and architecture of the cemetery; the cemetery's relationship to the Civil War; the African-American history of the city as seen through the cemetery and a history of disease and death in Atlanta in the 19th century. An annual celebration, Sunday in the Park, brings a Victorian-style street festival to the cemetery grounds. At Halloween, nighttime tours feature actors portraying some of the cemetery's residents and visits inside the elaborate mausoleums. David S. Moore, executive director of the Historic Oakland Foundation, sums up Oakland, saying, Every great city has great institutions of higher education, great art institutes, important green space - and a great cemetery. This is Atlanta's great cemetery.''"

"Ocmulgee National Monument Georgia","Georgia","Ocmulgee National Monument Georgia","Ocmulgee National Monument was established to preserve a period of historic times and people that have left behind their archeological and geological presence in the region. Ocmulgee National Monument covers roughly 700 acres of land and is one of the smaller national monuments. Many centuries of Southeast culture are preserved at the monument. The culture that once lived in the area built various architectural structures including wooden buildings, burial mounds, and temple mounds. The mounds are interesting lodges constructed within the earth. The circular earth lodges were used as the venue for ancient ceremonies and meetings. Early archeologists have visited the area over the years to research what the mounds can tell the world culturally and historically. Ocmulgee National Monument is located in central Georgia along the Ocmulgee River. The river is located on a unique stretch of land that extends from South Carolina to Alabama. The monument and area is named after the river which is an ancient Hichiti word that means boiling water. The closest city to the site is Macon. Many visitors to Ocmulgee National Monument are enthralled with the walking trail available to visitors. One of the trails is over six miles and winds through the upland forests, open meadows, natural areas, and wetlands. The natural beauty that is seen on the trail entices many visitors to explore the monument. Visitors to the monument are particularly interested in exploring the prehistoric trenches, burial, and temple mounds. Because of the vast vegetation and expanse of wildlife - the visitors who take the trail are advised to stay on marked areas in order to avoid snakes, fire ants, ticks, and poison ivy. A rich variety of plants and wildlife live in the monument area. Ocmulgee National Monument is equipped with a Visitors Center for tourists who want more detailed information either before of after exploring the monument. An orientation film called Mysteries of the Mounds is an interpretive movie that reveals geological and historical facts. The Visitors Center is also accessible to the hearing and vision impaired. The orientation film is captioned and there are braille transcriptions of the monument's story in the center. The most educational feature of the Visitors Center is the Discovery Lab, which is used by teachers and group leaders that want to provide a hands-on learning experience. Ocmulgee National Monument is open all year from 9AM - 5PM. There are no fees to enter the monument grounds. Ocmulgee was designated as a National Monument in June of 1934 but was not listed on the National Register of Historic places until 1966. Today, Ocmulgee National Monument is operated by the National Park Service. Volunteers, organizations, and an association called the Friends of Ocmulgee Old Fields have a mission of preserving, protecting, and participating in the general upkeep of the monument grounds. Each year, well over a hundred thousand people come to the monument to pay remembrance to the cultures that once lived in the area and have an up close view of well preserved earth lodges that were constructed centuries ago."

The course was also ranked among the Best Residential Golf Courses'' by GolfWeek Magazine, and Best Courses for Women'' by Golf for Women magazine. The course has also hosted tournaments, such as the 2007 PGA Cup, the 2007 Chick-fil-A Bowl Alma Mater and several NCAA tournaments. Like most Rees Jones' layouts, the risk-reward options are many. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,299 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA course rating of 72.2 and a slope rating of 135 on Bermuda grass. The course features fairways that roll and twist, with frequent downhill tee shots followed by uphill approach shots to elevated greens.

In addition to the five holes where the lake comes directly into play, the course also features interior creeks and ponds, along with heavy bunkering to add to the challenge. The Oconee course is known for a lot of variation, with both short and long par-4s and some good risk-reward par-5s. The course is also known for its collection of par-3s. No. 5, in particular, is a picturesque hole, with a downhill tee shot with two willow trees framing a pond. And No. 15 provides another stunning hole, as an inlet of Lake Oconee and some purple mule grass provide the visual splendor. The greens at Oconee are challenging, but tend to be more manageable for golfers who keep their approach shots below the hole. The greens tend to be well-sloped, but without any of the dinstint tiers found on some of the plantation's other courses. As part of Reynolds Plantation, the Oconee course also features outstanding instructional facilities. The Reynolds Golf Academy is a state-of-the-art learning center spread over 16 acres, with a 6,550-square-foot campus catering to golfers of all levels. Reynolds Plantation is also one of only seven sites in the world to incorporate the TaylorMade Performance Lab swing-analysis and club-fitting technology. The lab combines nine high-speed cameras with advanced computing and motion-capture technology to analyze each golfer's swing and match it to the proper equipment. The Oconee course features a rustic clubhouse adjacent to the Ritz-Carlton Lodge. The clubhouse is home to the Oconee Golf Shop, which was named one of the 100 Best Golf Shops in America'' by Golf World Business magazine in 2007. For dining, the Linger Longer Bar & Grille offers classic steakhouse cuisine, free-range poultry, and more elegant fare, such as Maine lobster, fish and rotisserie entrees.

"Oglethorpe Square","Georgia","Oglethorpe Square","Located in Savannah are The Squares which the city was created around, they were originally created as a space for military exercises. Over the centuries many squares have been created in the honor of persons or historical events and contain markers or monuments. This square is on Abercorn Street between State and York Streets.

"Old Fort Jackson: Savannah's Protector for 200 Years","Georgia","Old Fort Jackson: Savannah's Protector for 200 Years","Old Fort Jackson, or Fort James Jackson, as it is called by the National Park Service, is a historic fort just outside of downtown Savannah. The fort is named for James Jackson, who led the force that liberated Savannah from the British in 1782. The fort is located on the Savannah River about three miles from the Historic District. All of the Historic District's attractions, including the Green-Meldrim House, the Jepson Center for the Arts, the Savannah History Museum and the Owens-Thomas House, are within ten to fifteen minutes of the fort. Old Fort Jackson was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2000. It is owned by the state but maintained and operated by the Coastal Heritage Society (CHS), a local non-profit organization that employs dozen of preservationists, archaeologists and curators to discover, restore and protect the coastal history of Georgia. The fort was built in 1808 at the behest of President Jefferson, who sensed a coming war with Britain, as part of the Seacoast Fortification program. According to the National Park Service, It is nationally significant as one of only five surviving Second System Seacoast Fortifications. Most of the Second System forts were so radically redesigned by later defensive construction that little remains of their original works.'' First System coastal fortifications, used during the American Revolution, were mostly made of wood and earthen works. The Second System forts were put in place after the war because military technology had made the older forts vulnerable to bombardment from sea. According to the Savannah Morning News, this system featured high stone or brick walls with multilevel tiers containing internal casemates and gun positions for more firepower.'' Almost immediately after the War of 1812, however, a Third System was initiated, again to upgrade forts. Fort Jackson's Second System battery was left untouched during this upgrade. The fort was seized by Confederate troops in 1861 and was held until 1864. It was the city's primary naval defense during the Civil War. After the Civil War, the fort became less important. In 1923, the federal government sold the fort, which sat abandoned for over 40 years. The state operated the fort for a few years in the 1960s and `70s. The CHS has operated it ever since. Today, Fort Jackson receives about 50,000 visitors a year. It has an active education program as well as a calendar of social events. The fort welcomes student groups to its Student Militia program, which they have also adapted especially for Scout programs. Students get to learn basic maneuvers, hold replicas of period weapons, and face tough'' questioning from drill sergeants.'' Events at the fort include the annual Fort Jackson Auction and Low Country Boil, the Parent-Child Campover and daily cannon firings throughout the summer. (Fort Jackson is the only historic fort in the United States to deliver cannon salutes to passing military vessels.) The fort can also be rented for events. Reviews of Old Fort Jackson on the Internet are very positive. Even young people love it! The location, just outside of Savannah's Historic District, makes it popular with tourists. Ships pass by the fort almost within arm's reach. One visitor says, This was the best place we found in Savannah to watch the ships.'' The leader of a Girl Scout Troop called it an awesome educational experience ... I thought this would be boring, but it was quite an experience for the girls.'' A student sums up the Fort Jackson experience by saying, I went to this fort with my class and it was sooo fun and educational! First, a man in character lined us and taught us drill commands. This may sound boring, but it was very funny! Then he sat us down and talked about how the Fort was used and different cool facts.'' It doesn't get much better than that."

"Owens-Thomas House: Savannah's","Georgia","Owens-Thomas House: Savannah's, and the Country's, Finest Regency Home","The Owens-Thomas House is a museum home located in the Historic District of downtown Savannah. It is located on Abercorn Street in the center of the District, five blocks from the Riverfront and only minutes from Interstate 16. All of Savannah's downtown attractions are within walking distance of the house. The Owens-Thomas House is now owned by the Telfair Museum of Art. The house was built between 1816 and 1819 by William Jay, a young English architect who had a practice in London. According to Frederick D. Nichols, author of the classic reference Early Architecture of Georgia, William Jay was unquestionably one of the most important architects practicing anywhere in America in the early part of the nineteenth century.'' Jay built several more important homes in Savannah, including the building that now houses the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Juliette Gordon-Low Home. The Owens-Thomas House is considered to be the finest example of Regency architecture in the United States. The house shows many Regency characteristics, including attenuated columns, graceful curves and fanlights. It was also one of the most sophisticated homes of its time, featuring a complicated plumbing system that gathered rainwater into cisterns and allowed for bathtubs, sinks and showers with running water as well as flush toilets. The home was built for Richard Richardson, a banker and cotton merchant in Savannah. He sold the house to Savannah mayor George Owens in 1830; it remained in the Owens family until 1951, when it was bequeathed to the Telfair Museum of Art. The house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Since 1992, the museum has been preserving and restoring the house. Very few pieces remain from the original furnishings. Instead, the house has become a collection of decorative arts from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The tour of the house begins in the Carriage House Visitor's Center, which is actually the old stables and slave quarters. It proceeds through the English garden into the house and covers most of the interior of the house. Guides attempt to place the house and its early inhabitants into their historical context. The Owens-Thomas House continues to research the lives of the Owens family, to acquire family furnishings and to rearrange the house according to the custom of the time. In early 2009, several rooms were reinterpreted. What was thought to be the music room has become an informal family dining room. The drawing room has taken on the function of a game room as well. Paint, carpet and window treatments have been modified. Even as these changes take place, the museum sends experts to England to study with architectural and artistic historians to ensure that they get as many details as possible as close to correct as possible. Reviews from well-known travel websites of the house itself are excellent. The architecture and the decorative arts collection both receive high marks. The tour, on the other hand, is not as well-liked. Visitors think the tour itself is too short, while the time they are made to wait to get started is far too long. Some commenters liked their guides. One notes that our tour guide was funny, highly entertaining and extremely knowledgeable.'' Others, however, think the guides could be better, calling them rude,'' condescending,'' and very disappointing.'' Hopefully, this finest of Regency homes will continue to strive for the best, in both period detail and service."

"Phipps Plaza: Atlanta's Luxury Shopping Mall","Georgia","Phipps Plaza: Atlanta's Luxury Shopping Mall","Phipps Plaza is located in Buckhead, the upscale shopping, commercial and residential district in the heart of Atlanta. The 800,000-square-foot Phipps is the most luxurious mall in the city, with exclusive Atlanta locations of many of the world's most prestigious retailers. The mall is accessible from Georgia Highway 400, the major route directly north out of the city, and Interstate 85, the major route to the northeast of downtown. Phipps may also be reached from two different MARTA stations (Atlanta's rapid transit system) and by numerous bus routes. The Buckhead Uptown Connection, or buc,'' is a free shuttle which stops at various office and retail locations in Buckhead, including Phipps Plaza. The primary trade area for the shopping center includes over 1.3 million people, and the immediate surrounding area is the largest concentration of income and buying power to be found in the southern United States,'' according to a study from the University of Georgia. Phipps Plaza was built in 1969. At the time, it was Atlanta's only multi-level mall. It is across the street from Lenox Square, one of the city's premier shopping destinations, and together the two malls offer virtually any product that can be bought in a shopping center. Phipps was intended from the outset as a luxury center. Its original anchors were Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. The mall remains today the only Saks location in Georgia. Lord & Taylor pulled out of the Georgia market in 2004 and was replaced by Nordstrom. In 1992, the mall expanded and added a third anchor, Parisian, which was bought by Belk in 2006.  Saks is known for its designer boutiques, including Fendi, Prada, Dior and Vera Wang. Nordstrom boasts a personal shopping service that customers love. Belk has always been known as a moderate to mid-upper level retailer, and retail experts were concerned that the store might not be a good fit for the luxury-oriented Phipps. However, Belk has made its Phipps Plaza location a flagship'' store, offering higher-end brands like Eileen Fisher, Kenneth Cole and Joseph Abboud.  Retail consultant Barbara Babbit Kaufmann says, [T]he Belk name ... is not a typical Phipps retailer. ... I think it is going to be difficult and they have their work cut out for them.'' The retail experiment is working so far, and Belk has opened three other flagship stores at upscale locations. Phipps also includes many specialty shops that are not found anywhere else in Atlanta. Among these are Bang & Olufsen Atlanta, Tiffany, Hugo Boss, Gucci, Georgio Armani, Valentino, Versace and Jimmy Choo. The mall has a day-spa, exclusive hair salons, original art galleries, a Metropolitan Museum of Art store, fine jewelers and, of course, clothes, clothes, clothes. Well-heeled Atlanta matrons, local and national celebrities, those who wish to see and be seen,'' and even those who just find it fun to watch how the other half lives can all be found at Phipps. The readers of Southern Living magazine, the arbiter of taste for all things Southern, voted Phipps Plaza a Southern Best'' in the magazine's Readers' Choice Awards. No doubt the mall will continue to be among the South's best shopping venues for a long time to come."

The Piedmont Exposition Company used the grounds to hold three expositions, the most famous of which was the Cotton States & International Exposition of 1895, essentially a world's fair, which was created to introduce the new Atlanta,'' its culture and its products to the world. The Driving Club tried periodically to sell the acreage to the City of Atlanta, finally succeeding in 1904.

By the 1970s, its structures were dilapidated and the park was known more as a place not to go at night than a place to recreate by day. In 1992, the Piedmont Park Conservancy, a private group, formed a public-private partnership with the City of Atlanta to restore and maintain the park. The Conservancy has diligently worked to renovate the park and its infrastructure and maintain security and safety. Today, Piedmont Park is truly the central park of the city.

"Reynolds Square","Georgia","Reynolds Square","Reynolds Square is part of the square located in Savannah; the squares were planned by James Oglethorpe who called for six wards and squares.

John Reynolds who was the unpopular governor of Georgia in the mid 1750s.

A bronze statue stands on the square which honors John Wesley who was the founder of Methodism, he undertook a mission in Savannah in which he founded the first Sunday school in America. The statue stands in the spot where it is believed that his home once stood. The intent of the statue is to show Wesley preaching out-of-doors just like he used to when he was leading a service for Native Americans this was a practice that angered church elders as they believed that preaching should have only been done inside the church.

"Rhodes Memorial Hall: Atlanta's Grand Castle on Peachtree","Georgia","Rhodes Memorial Hall: Atlanta's Grand Castle on Peachtree","Rhodes Hall is one of the last remaining mansions left on Atlanta's famous Peachtree Street, a thoroughfare that was once lined with the great homes of the city's wealthiest residents. The home, located in the northern part of Atlanta's Midtown area, is easily reached from Interstates 75 and 85. Nearby attractions include Piedmont Park, the Atlanta Botanical Garden, the High Museum of Art Atlantic Station and the Center for Puppetry Arts. The nearest public transit train station is about one-half mile away, but a bus line also serves the area. Rhodes Hall was the home of A.G. Rhodes and his wife, Amanda. Rhodes, born in Kentucky in 1850, came to Atlanta in 1875. In 1879, he started a small furniture store that would turn into an empire that stretched across the southeast. When Rhodes started his business, the Southern economy had not yet recovered from the Civil War. He figured the only way ordinary folk'' could afford his furniture would be if they made weekly payments. For several years, Rhodes made his collection rounds personally, and when the final payment had been made, the customer brought home the new furniture. This is perhaps the first known instance of installment plan purchasing in the United States. Rhodes Furniture operated throughout the region until 2005, when it was bought by another company. By the turn of the 20th century, A.G. Rhodes was one of the richest men in Atlanta. He wanted a house that reflected his wealth and status. He and his wife had traveled in Germany and were inspired by the castles along the Rhine River. He chose architect Willis F. Denny to design the house starting in 1902. Denny was, according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, an important transitional figure in ... Georgia architecture. ...His work reflects the major shifts in design that took place ... when the picturesque, eclectic forms of the Victorian era gave way to neoclassicism and more historically accurate period revival styles.'' Rhodes Hall's architecture is typically referred to as Romanesque Revival. It is built of massive blocks of granite quarried from nearby Stone Mountain, with round arches, a turret and a massive crenellated tower. The Atlanta Urban Design Commission describes the house: Rhodes Hall is virtually unparalleled in Georgia. Very few residential structures were ever built in Romanesque architecture and Rhodes Hall is this state's best example. ... Denny and Rhodes created a special example of the Victorian Romanesque Revival, taken from medieval Romanesque sources and adapted for use as an early 20th century house.'' Frommer's describes the interior as grandiose, with maple- and mahogany-bordered oak parquet floors, mosaics surrounding the fireplaces, and a gracefully winding hand-carved Honduran mahogany staircase with nine stained-glass stairwell panels depicting `The Rise and Fall of the Confederacy.''' When the Rhodes died, their children left the house to the State of Georgia, with a requirement that it be used only for historical purposes. Since 1983, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation has leased the house as its headquarters, as well as a place to carry out their goal of preserving the state's past for use in the future. They are meticulously restoring the house to its original grandeur with the help of the International Fine Arts Conservation Studios. The house is open for tours, and it is also a very popular event space. Several parts of the house are available for rental, including the entire first floor, which accommodates up to 175 guests reception-style; the Reception Hall, which holds up to 50 people at dinner, and the Library, Den and Front Porch, which can hold smaller gatherings. Reviewers of Rhodes Hall love the place as a piece of history - The stained glass windows are a unique memorial to the Confederacy.'' - but also as an event space. One woman said of her wedding day, [The staff] was the best to work with. The site looked fantastic. ...Rhodes Hall is a must-see!'' Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes would no doubt be pleased that their lovely old house is now a part of Atlanta's social and historic fabric."

"Savannah Theatre: Savannah's","Georgia","Savannah Theatre: Savannah's, and the Country's, Oldest Continuously Operating Theater Site","The Savannah Theatre, located in downtown Savannah, sits on the same site as a theater that opened in 1818. The buildings on that site have been continuously operated as theaters ever since. The theater is in the heart of the historic district within walking distance of all of Savannah's historic attractions, including Factor's Walk, Forsyth Park and River Street. The theater is immediately accessible from Interstate 16. The original theater on the site opened in 1818. The building was designed by William Jay, a prominent English architect who worked for years in Savannah. Jay designed some of Savannah's finest buildings, including the Owens-Thomas House and the Telfair Mansion, now part of the Telfair Museum of Art. The building held 1,000 patrons and was ornately decorated in gold and green paint, fluted columns with gilt capitals, a painted ceiling and a painted curtain that was shipped from New York. The theater survived the 19th century despite financial crises, the Civil War and several fires in the city. In 1906, however, the original building was destroyed by fire. The building burned again before its current incarnation was built in 1948. The newest building is in the Art Moderne style, a sleeker, plainer version of Art Deco. It is clean, white concrete with a curved marquis, but one of the original walls from 1818 remains inside the building. The theater operated as a movie house for years, and then as the sometime home of a local theater company. The theater's financial situation was uncertain, until new owners bought it in 2002 and completely renovated it, redoing the interior, the plumbing and the mechanical systems. A theater company from Branson, the show capital of middle America, was looking for a new home when they found the Savannah Theatre. The company decided to run the same type of shows they produced in Branson - musical reviews of oldies and broadway tunes. In August of 2002, the company opened with Lost in the 50s, '' which ran for over a year. The company has produced a series of similar shows ever since, including Jukebox Journey,'' The Beat Goes On,'' Hooray for Hollywood,'' and A Christmas Tradition.'' The shows are attended equally by locals and out-of-town tourists. Mike Meece, the theater manager says, We were counting on 90 percent of our business being tourists. It never dawned on us that 50 percent of our business might be local folks.'' The Savannah Theatre is wildly popular. Of 28 reviewers on a well-known travel website, 27 rated the experience as Excellent,'' and the other person rated it Very Good.'' There are, literally, no negative comments about the shows or the theatre. It is one of the most popular attractions in Savannah. One reviewer says, I smiled so hard my face hurt!'' Others mention the talented and friendly cast and the beautifully renovated theater. Many echo this person, saying, This is the one place you have to go when visiting Savannah.'' Meece, the manager, says gratefully of his customers, Seven years later, we still have people saying `I just want to thank you one more time for coming to Savannah.'''"

"Sea Island Golf Club, Seaside Course, St. Simons Island, Georgia - An Oceanside, Links-Style Golf Experience","Georgia","Sea Island Golf Club, Seaside Course, St. Simons Island, Georgia - An Oceanside, Links-Style Golf Experience","The Seaside Course at the Sea Island Golf Club is an oceanside links-style course situated at the southern tip of St. Simmons Island, and is considered the more demanding layout of the two 18-hole, championship courses the club has to offer. The Seaside Course was originally designed in 1929 by famed golf-course architects Harry S. Cole and Charles Alison, and was later updated in 1999 by Tom Fazio. During the renovation, Fazio successfully combined the orginal Seaside nine holes with the former Marshside nine, maintaining the look, feel and strategy of their originals, while updating the course to the modern game. The course is located on the former site of the Retreat Plantation, and the remains of an old slave cemetery are still clearly visible. Sections of the course have the wild, windswept feel of an oceanside layout, winding through grassy dunes that back up against ocean breezes, while the rest of the course plays through the quiet solitude of Georgia marshland. The par-70 course plays to 7,055 yards from the tips, with a USGA course rating of 73.8 and a slope rating of 141 on Bermuda grass. The front nine of the new Seaside Course plays along the Atlantic Ocean and is said to be a warm-up'' for the back nine, which plays through the island's marshes, and the greens on the back nine are particularly beguiling. According to a local caddy, the greens are reminiscent of Pinehurst and tend to slope off on all sides. As a general rule, the break is often much bigger than what players tend to read. As a testament to its quality, the Seaside Course has hosted a number of USGA events over the years. Golf Digest also ranks it among the Top 100 Courses in the United States,'' and #27 among America's 100 Greatest Public Courses,'' while Golf for Women rated the course #3 among its Top 50 Courses for Women.'' The resort has also received numberous honors and accolades, including: #1 Destination for Business Meetings and Golf, by Golf Digest/USA Today, 2008; a ranking in the Platinum Category for Premier Resorts 2008'' by Golf Magazine; and being acclaimed Best U.S. Golf Community'' by Travel & Leisure Golf, 2007-2008. Practice facilities include a driving range with grass tee areas, a sand and chipping area and putting green. A Golf Learning Center is also available, featuring clinic, private and group lessons. The resort blends the style and tradition of southern hospitality with Georgia's scenic Atlantic coast, including five miles of private beach. In addition to golf, guests can choose from activities such as horseback riding, a shooting school, and massage services. At The Lodge at Sea Island Golf Club, there's even 24-hour butler service available. Dining options include something for every palate, from casual to formal. The hallmark of the resort over the years has been a local partnership with area farmers, butchers and fishermen to ensure that ingredients are at their freshest. For upscale dining, Colt & Alison is best known for its wet- and dry-aged beef, while the Mobil Five-Star Georgian Room features Refined Southern'' cuisine and an extensive wine list."

All of the members were servants, skilled workers, and some were also freed individuals. The pastor at the time was Reverend Henry Cunningham. He served the church for 39 years.

"Southlake Mall: Morrow, Georgia's Center for Retail Shopping","Georgia","Southlake Mall: Morrow, Georgia's Center for Retail Shopping","Southlake Mall is located on Interstate 75, the major highway heading south from Atlanta, at its intersection with Georgia Highway 54. The mall is about 20 miles south of downtown Atlanta in suburban Clayton County, the metro area's fifth largest county. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is 10 miles away. The mall's primary trade area includes over 825,000 people, and it is growing at a rate of around three percent a year, a relatively slow growth rate for the Atlanta area. Southlake contains over one million square feet of shopping and is anchored by JCPenney, Sears and Macy's. It was built in 1976 and renovated in 1999. While some parts of Atlanta's southern suburbs have prospered, the Morrow area has not. Southlake Mall has not been able to remain current with shopping trends as its sales have fallen over the years. Besides the anchors, only a few nationally known stores remain. Those include Aeropostale, Foot Locker, American Eagle Outfitters, Lane Bryant and Victoria's Secret. Most of the retailers in the mall are local. Southlake was once one of two regional malls for a wide swath of counties south of Atlanta, but its preeminence has been replaced by newer power centers,'' open-air shopping centers where customers drive directly to the stores of their choice. C. Whitney Knoll, a manager of an Atlanta commercial real estate firm, notes, All the new power centers in [nearby] Henry County have sucked the energy out of Southlake.'' The mall's owner, General Growth Properties, declared bankruptcy in early 2009, and Knoll says that this could, ironically, work in Southlake Mall's favor. The Atlanta Business Chronicle quotes Knoll as saying that another owner could do something with it that General Growth can't do right now.'' In a stroke of fortune for Southlake, AMC Theatres, the company that operates the mall's cinema, is opening IMAX screens at a limited number of locations across the country. Southlake was chosen as one of only two theatres in the Atlanta metro area to receive the technology. (Other locations are expected to open later.) This screen is the only IMAX theatre on the south side of Atlanta. J.B. Burke, a local resident, expressed his astonishment, saying, This is wonderful news. I can't believe it's on this side of town.'' Burke and others hope that the IMAX will prove to be an economic boon for the area. As one can imagine, customers' reviews of Southlake Mall are not spectacular. Most shoppers are unhappy with the selection of stores in the mall, and some worry about crime and cleanliness. Most of the stores in the mall do not meet my needs,'' says one customer. Don't feel safe in the parking lots,'' notes another. Younger shoppers, on the other hand, are happier with the mall's offerings. A Dedicated Young Customer'' responding to a blog entry says, [T]hey have all the nice new clothing.'' One of the most glowing remarks on one website said, Southlake Mall is not that bad.'' The mall's survival may depend on many more dedicated young customers'' finding the mall not that bad.''"

"St. Catherines Island Center","Georgia","St. Catherines Island Center - Midway, Georgia - private island used as a refuge for endangered animals","According to Georgia's state laws, all beaches must be open to the public. However, the interior of St. Catherines Island is off limits to the public without an appointment. This land serves as a center for endangered animals. The St. Catherines Island Foundation owns the island, which is ten miles long and one to three miles wide, and they run the St. Catherines Island Center and care for the animals that live there. The St. Catherines Island Center focuses on creating an undisturbed habitat for animals like ospray, sea turtles, and lemurs. They employ a number of researchers to work at the center, studying and caring for these animals, while also educating the general public about these creatures. The center was founded in 1974 as a pilot program that's often called a Noah's Arc.'' Essentially, animal species that are facing extinction are represented on the island and bred to build up population numbers. The animals are then sent to other facilities to continue with breeding and care. There are 14 zoos in the St. Catherines Island Center network that help breed colonies of exotic and endangered animals. The entire island was declared a National Historic Landmark, which will prevent the area from being disturbed long into the future. That means that the center can continue saving animal species. They've already successful bred rare animals such as the Aldabra tortoise, the St. Vincent parrot, the Grevy's zebra, the ring-tailed lemur, and the Jackson's hartebeest. One of the most successful programs at the St. Catherines Island Center has been the Sea Turtle Conservation Program, along with Aldabra tortoises, which are a rare form of the endangered Galapagos tortoises, the center is home to loggerhead sea turtles, leatherback sea turtles, Kemp's Ridley sea turtles, green sea turtles, and a few other endangered species. Since visitation to the center is only permissible under special circumstances, they've created a mobile sea turtle exhibit, which focuses on educating children and adults about these endangered reptiles. The conservation efforts of the center have helped researchers learn more about many different kinds of sea turtle species. The island is accredited with the Associate of Zoos and Aquariums and participates in national Species Survival Programs. The island is divided into a number of distinct ecosystems to help the animals live as naturally as possible, which helps with breeding. Staff members monitor weather conditions, animal health and safety, and other habitat concerns, but for the most part, the animals are left to enjoy a life without people disturbing them. Because of this, many of the animals on the island live to be far older than the normal life expectancy in the wild. Although St. Catherines Island Center isn't open to the public normally, they do have outreach programs for nearby schools and organization and do grant tours of the island and its facilities at times, depending on the circumstances. There are no fees associated with visiting the island, though visitors should remember that the center is non-profit and survives through donations and similar forms of support. To learn more about the center or visiting options, guests can contact the Department of Geology and Geography at Georgia Southern University by calling 912-478-5353."

"Stone Mountain Carving","Georgia","Stone Mountain Carving","Stone Mountain Carving in Stone Mountain, Georgia was something started by the Daughters of the Confederacy. Helen Plane felt it was necessary to preserve the memory of the Confederacy Veterans. The first convention took place in Atlanta, Georgia where it was discussed. It was supported all through Georgia and so carving on Stone Mountain began.  Plane decided since much of Atlanta and other areas of Georgia were destroyed in the war that she would use the largest piece of exposed granite to remember those who died in the war. The largest piece in the world is Stone Mountain. It would take years for the contracted work to start. In fact it wasn't until 1915 that artist Gutzon Borglum would begin the carving. Unfortunately, things did not go smoothly as Borglum and Plane did not agree so he left in 1924. There were also periods of economic issues with raising the money to get the carving commissioned. Eventually however, the Stone Mountain Carving was finished. The carving shows Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and Jefferson Davis as three of the four men on horseback. The second group was never added to the carving due to financial issues."

"Streets of Buckhead: Atlanta's New ``Rodeo Drive''","Georgia","Streets of Buckhead: Atlanta's New ``Rodeo Drive''","Streets of Buckhead is a new retail, hotel and residential development in the heart of Atlanta's most luxurious district. The project is located on Peachtree Street, the city's legendary thoroughfare, and is easily accessed from Interstate 85, the main route northeast from downtown, and Georgia Highway 400, the main commuter route to the northern suburbs. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is only 30 minutes away. The primary trade area for the Streets of Buckhead includes over 1.3 million people, and the immediate surrounding area is the largest concentration of income and buying power to be found in the southern United States,'' according to a study from the University of Georgia. The 600,000-square-foot retail component of the development is anchored by luxury retailers Herm,s and Van Cleef & Arpel. Other stores expected to open at Streets of Buckhead include Oscar de la Renta, Etro, Bottega Veneta, Domenico Vacca, Vilebrequin, Christofle, John Lobb and Loro Piana. An upscale gym and several world-class restaurants, including Le Colonial, The Capital Grille, Brioni, Japonais and La Goulue will also be part of the development. Later construction is expected to include at least one high-end hotel and luxury condominium units. The concept is meant to resemble Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive. Sam Massell, president of the Buckhead Coalition and former mayor of Atlanta, says of Buckhead, Retail is our strong suit. We are the retail mecca of the Southeast. Although the Buckhead area as a whole is characterized by affluent residents and the best office and commercial space in Atlanta, the central business district, known as Buckhead Village, had undergone a slow decline over the years. Along Peachtree Street, small storefront businesses had become seedy and unkempt. Most new businesses were bars that catered to a younger, rowdier crowd. The area was noisy and crowded, with little parking and horrible traffic on weekends. As Streets of Buckhead developer Ben Carter wryly noted, You basically had 'Bourbon Street' at the entrance to 'Bel Air.''' A series of high-profile crimes in the area finally convinced local officials to formulate a plan for redevelopment that required moderate, but not high density, development; residential and retail use; cleanliness and an emphasis on public safety; and improved pedestrian access. Ben Carter assembled almost 40 different properties to bring together the project. More than nine acres of existing buildings were razed in order to begin construction, literally remaking the area. The recession has delayed the project; Carter temporarily stopped work on the Streets of Buckhead in late 2008 in order to renegotiate the budget. In mid-2009, construction resumed, and the anchor tenants seem satisfied that the economy will recover enough to support an opening date of Fall 2010. Indeed, Atlanta is expected to be able to support more high-end retail in the next few years. A study from marketing research firm Claritas expects Atlanta's number of high-net-worth individuals to grow over the next five years at a rate that is second in the nation and more than five times the rate of growth in the general population. Streets of Buckhead will no doubt be a stunning shopping venue. Developer Ben Carter notes, The Streets of Buckhead will have the excitement and vibrance of New York and Madison Avenue - that same kind of experience - but in a compact, charming, truly walkable area.''"

"Sweet Auburn","Georgia","Sweet Auburn","Concentrated along a short mile and a half of Auburn Avenue, the Sweet Auburn Historic District reflects the history, heritage and achievements of Atlanta's African Americans. The name Sweet Auburn was coined by John Wesley Dobbs, referring to the richest Negro street in the world. Like other black communities throughout the country, Sweet Auburn's success was intricately tied to the residential patterns forced on African Americans during the early 20th century - the result of restrictive laws in southern states which enforced segregation of the races, known as Jim Crow laws. It was here that many African Americans established businesses, congregations, and social organizations.  Sweet Auburn was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. However, like so many other inner-city neighborhoods, Sweet Auburn fell victim to lack of investment, crime and abandonment, compounded by highway construction that split it in two. In 1992 the National Trust for Historic Preservation recognized that it was one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. Sweet Auburn Historic District is located along Auburn Avenue, generally between Courtland St. and I-75/85 in downtown Atlanta.

The bridge was dedicated to Eugene Talmage who was the governor of Georgia between 1933 and 1937. He was also governor from 1941 to 1943. The new bridge was named for Tomochichi, a Native American Creek Leader, but it was changed after public forums complained. It restored the original name of the bridge. The bridge is often compared to the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in Charleston, South Carolina because of its proximity and size. The Ravenel Bridge is one foot taller and has eight travel lanes, where as Talmage has four."

"Ten Park Place Building: One of Atlanta's Modernist Masterpieces","Georgia","Ten Park Place Building: One of Atlanta's Modernist Masterpieces","Ten Park Place, or the Thornton Building, as it was formerly known, is one of the few large-scale Modernist buildings in Atlanta. It is located in the heart of the Central Business District of downtown Atlanta. It can be easily accessed from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and from Interstate 20. The building is near many of Atlanta's downtown points of interest, including the Georgia Capitol, Underground Atlanta, the Georgia Aquarium, Philips Arena, the Georgia Dome, Turner Field, and Centennial Olympic Park. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has two train stations within walking distance of the building. Ten Park Place was built in 1932 on land belonging to the Thorntons, one of Atlanta's oldest families. The Thorntons had owned land in that area for generations. Albert E. Thornton commissioned the construction, replacing a block of commercial buildings put up by his grandfather 50 years earlier. The Thornton Building, as it was known then, was one of the last commercial buildings in downtown Atlanta to be constructed before first the Great Depression, and then World War II, brought a temporary halt to Atlanta's growth. It is a rare example in the city of the Modernist style of architecture. Modernism never caught on in Atlanta, and most of the buildings in that style have already been demolished. For that reason, the exterior of Ten Park Place has been designated a Landmark Building by the City of Atlanta, meaning that its destruction would be an irreparable loss to the city.'' One of the ultra modern'' features of Ten Park Place, according to the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce newsletter, City Builder, was the fact that the interior office space could be configured to each tenant's needs. The 1932 issue says that a large amount of office space is available and may be sub-divided ... to scientifically and efficiently arrange floor space.'' This is, of course, commonplace in office construction today, but it was a new concept in the 1930s. Other Modernist features of the building include its smooth, straight lines, the relative lack of ornamentation, and the large, first-floor display windows. A few Beaux Arts architectural details decorate the building, including an elaborately carved marble doorframe and pediment. The building was designed by Anthony Ten Eyck Brown, one of Atlanta's leading architects of public buildings in the first decades of the twentieth century. Ten Eyck Brown has several existing buildings in the city, but the most prominent are both within walking distance of Ten Park Place - the Martin Luther King, Jr. Federal Building (originally the Post Office Annex), built in 1933, and the Fulton County Courthouse, built in 1914. Together these three buildings show Ten Eyck Brown's evolution from the neoclassical Beaux Arts style to the elegant, understated Modernism of nearly 20 years later. Today, Ten Park Place is still a functioning office building. (Note that its interior space has been reconfigured many times!) Visitors may walk into its public spaces, which retain their historic character. Most of the offices in the building are private business concerns, however, and are off-limits to the public."

It starts with Chef Darin Sehnert - Chef Darin, to his students. Although Chef Darin is well-credentialed, with a degree from Johnson & Wales and a partnership with Le Cordon Bleu-Paris, it is his personality that makes him a hit in class. Consider these comments from TripAdvisor - Chef Darin answered every and all questions,'' and was very generous with his time.'' He was informative, funny and had [a] perfect approach...'' Chef Darin is fun, entertaining and full of knowledge.'' After all, as the chef explained in the Savannah Morning News, A big part of [my] cooking philosophy is having fun. Cooking can and should be an expression of one's creativity, not the drudgery of following a recipe with 22 steps.'' Another popular aspect of the class is that it is accessible to all ages and all levels of talent. One family brought their three boys, ages 11, 13 and 14, and watched them devouring food they would have never ... eaten in a restaurant.''

These classes focus on specific kitchen techniques and include Flavor Dynamics, Stewing and Braising, Intro to Cake Decorating, Searing & Sauteeing and Knife Skills. Seasonal cooking. Chef Darin has classes for every season, including Holiday Cookies, Christmas Brunch, Valentine's Sweet Treats, Summer Cookouts (not like any cookout you've ever had!), Autumn Harvest Supper and Stress Free Thanksgiving. Regional cooking.  These classes focus on a particular region's cuisine and include Northern Italy, Low Country, French Bistro, Tapas, Mezze & More!, Lighter Latin and Mexican Fiesta! The school offers special events as well, like an all-day class that takes students to local markets to shop and then comes back to the school to prepare what they have bought, classes that feature guest chefs, and vacation classes that take place at other locations. In addition, the school offers packages that include a stay at the Mansion or a meal at the hotel's restaurant, 700 Drayton. The Low Country cooking class is by far the most popular, although there are no classes that have gotten less than stellar ratings. Most classes are three hours long and are reasonably priced. This person's comment sums up the 700 Kitchen Cooking School experience: I thought it strange that a cooking class was the #1 thing to do in Savannah on tripadvisor.com, but after participating I can certainly understand why. Hats off to you, Chef Darin, and thanks for the experience.''"

The Alliance Theatre, formed in 1968, is the leading resident theater company in the Southeast, and is one of the most prominent regional theaters in the country. In 2007, the Alliance won the Regional Theatre Tony Award. In addition to its main stage, the theater offers the Hertz Stage, which produces more offbeat works, and the Children's Stage. The Alliance also has film and stage acting classes for all ages, workshops and summer camps. The theater first came to national prominence in the 1990s, under the artistic direction of Kenny Leon. Leon demanded, through his productions, that the theater become more responsive to the city's African American community. During his tenure, the Alliance's African American audience grew from five percent to 25 percent of ticket buyers. Leon resigned from the Alliance in 2000 and has gone on to direct on Broadway and form another company in Atlanta. In 2001, the Alliance selected Susan V. Booth as the new artistic director. Booth immediately put her own stamp on the company by partnering with smaller local theaters, in part seeking to broaden the audience of the Alliance. She created the Collision Project, in which a playwright collaborates with high-school students in creating a new play, and she has fostered the Kendeda Graduate Playwright Competition, which chooses a student playwright's work and produces it on the main stage of the theater. The Alliance has premiered more than 50 works, several of which have gone on to Broadway, including Pearl Cleage's Blues for an Alabama Sky; The Color Purple; Elton John and Tim Rice's Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida, which became the Broadway hit Aida; Alfred Uhry's The Last Night of Ballyhoo and many others from both nationally known and local playwrights. Scott Sanders, who produced The Color Purple for the Alliance says, Starting with Kenny Leon's work and certainly now with Susan's, the Alliance has become a real force ... in the development of new work.'' The Regional Tony award has brought even more national recognition to the Alliance. Howard Sherman, executive director of the organization that presents the Tonys, said in the New York Times that the theater has `balanced that [nationally recognized work] with a strong commitment to new writers and education.''' Chris Jones, a theater critic on the committee for the Regional Tonys, said in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, `I think the members of the association responded to a long history at the Alliance, and also a sense that the theater is being rejuvenated under Ms. Booth.'' Subscribership has been going up throughout the decade, after falling dramatically after 9/11. With the national attention that has come with the Tony, the Alliance Theatre looks like it's going to be onstage for a long run."

The venue is immediately accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is about fifteen minutes away. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station about one-quarter of a mile away, and the center is also served by bus. Parking is available for approximately 1,000 vehicles. The Civic Center opened in 1968, a project brought to fruition by Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., who oversaw many civic and arts projects in Atlanta during the 1960s. The venue was built to accommodate the Metropolitan Opera's annual visits to Atlanta, which were a social and artistic tradition going back to 1910. Despite being more than 40 years old, the venue's size continues to bring in bookings, although its acoustics and technical features are considered out-of-date. In the 1980s, it was named one of the city's architectural beasts,'' and, by the 1990s, the center was well-known, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, for the mausoleum ambience, the canyon-like acoustics, the broken seats, the shortage of women's toilets.'' The 4,600-seat center underwent an extensive renovation in 2001, which fixed some of its cosmetic and comfort flaws. The venue is now booked about 260 days a year with crowd-pleasing exhibitions like King Tut, Bodies ... The Exhibition and America I AM; concerts from performers like Erykah Badu and Morris Day and the Time; comedy tours; conventions and commencement ceremonies. The Civic Center's theater is available for event rental, and the complex offers 5,800 square feet of meeting space, as well. The ballroom seats up to 500 people theater-style or up to 300 for a banquet. The plaza and lobbies are also available for receptions. As a premier event facility, however, newer or more glamorous venues outshine the Civic Center. The AJC says that the sprawling airplane hangar of a venue'' is too large for many shows and lacks the Fox's cachet.'' Two new spaces, the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre and Gwinnett Center, in Atlanta's suburbs, are more modern and better suited to today's performance standards. The Atlanta Opera, which had its home at the Civic Center from 2003 to 2007, left its disastrous former venue,'' again according to the AJC, for Cobb Energy's more intimate and acoustically dynamic theater. In fact, the City of Atlanta, which owns and operates the Civic Center, has been considering redevelopment plans for the space for several years, which may include adding onto the complex or razing the center completely, although no decision is likely in the near future. If the center can continue to book popular exhibitions like Bodies and King Tut, its future should be secure, but, as of this writing, even Bodies has found a new home in Atlanta. Among reviewers on the Internet, the venue is not rated very highly. One person says, It reminds me of a high school auditorium.'' Another notes that the Civic Center is not a bad venue, but not one I really get excited about going to in comparison to other places in Atlanta.''"

Tuition in 1873 was $1 per month. In 1874 the institute was turned over to Savannah Board of Education. It was then a free public school for black children. In 1878 a fire damaged the building so it was temporarily closed. The American Missionary Association took control back opening educational programs for Savannah residents. It eventually became a Boys Club in 1917. In 1919 the Institute was closed due to a lack of enrollment. The building still stands today as an important piece of Georgia history."

The Candler Building is within walking distance or a very short drive of most of Atlanta's downtown attractions, including the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, Centennial Olympic Park, Underground Atlanta, the CNN Center Studio Tour, the Georgia Dome and Philips Arena. In Atlanta, a city known for tearing itself down every few years and starting over, the Candler Building stands as an elegant, and still useful, emblem of the city's past. Built in 1906, the building is a fine example of the Beaux Arts style of architecture, which was characterized by refined classicism mixed with showy, but tasteful, ornamentation. Indeed, the building boasts Tiffany glass, marble sculptures, and ornate brasswork as accents to the arches and pediments typical of classical architecture. At 17 stories tall, the Candler Building was the tallest building in Atlanta for over 20 years. The interior has been renovated and the plumbing, lighting and HVAC systems have been renewed recently. The building still functions as office space for some of Atlanta's most prominent law and real estate firms. The building was commissioned by Asa Candler, a local druggist who bought the rights to a caramel-colored carbonated drink known as Coca-Cola. By the end of the nineteenth century, Candler had amassed a fortune, and he began to invest in real estate. The site of the building, once home to the first church in Atlanta, is on a ridge that runs through downtown, making it all the more visible. The building, although designed to be monumental in its scope, was also built to be functional. It contained floors specifically designed for dentists, for instance, and housed employee amenities like an onsite bank and barbershop, as well as luxurious bathrooms.  The elevators and cooling system were state-of-the-art for their time. One of the Candler Building's distinguishing features is its marble sculpture. Most people are not aware, however, that the carved panels on the fazade of the building are of real-life figures representing various branches of the arts and sciences. Some of the famous faces on the building include William Shakespeare, representing literature; Benjamin Franklin, portraying statesmanship and philosophy; Beethoven and Richard Wagner, for music; Michelangelo, illustrating art; Admiral George Dewey, demonstrating military glory; and William Buffalo Bill'' Cody and Father Marquette, representing the pioneer life of the country. In 2006, the Atlanta chapter of the American Institute of Architects selected the Candler Building as the city's Building of Its Decade.'' The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. It has been designated a Landmark Building by the City of Atlanta, meaning that it is of exceptional importance to the city'' and that its demolition would represent an irreparable loss to the city.'' This designation was based on the building's historic, architectural and cultural significance. The Atlanta Preservation Center offers a guided walking tour that includes the Candler Building. Asa Candler hoped that the building would be a monument that would last for centuries.'' Indeed, the building looks to be well on its way."
"The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist: Savannah's Mother Church of the Diocese","Georgia","The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist: Savannah's Mother Church of the Diocese","The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, the Mother Church of the Savannah Diocese, is located on Lafayette Square in the Historic District of downtown Savannah. Also on Lafayette Square are the Andrew Low House, Flannery O'Connor House, Hamilton-Turner House and the Battersby-Hartridge-Anderson House. The Cathedral is in the center of the Historic District and is within walking distance of almost all downtown attractions. It is accessible from Interstate 16. CAT, Savannah's public transit system, has a free downtown shuttle that stops at the Cathedral. The first Catholic parish was established in Savannah in the late 18th century, and the first church called St. John the Baptist, a small wooden building, was built in 1800. Until 1850, Savannah, and all of Georgia, was part of the Charleston Diocese. In 1850, the Savannah Diocese was created, covering the entire state of Georgia and most of Florida. In the meantime, the congregation had continued to grow, and St. John the Baptist now had a brick church that seated 1,000 parishioners. This church became the Cathedral in 1850. By 1870, the diocese, now covering just the state of Georgia, had 20,000 people, and plans for a new Cathedral were made. Construction on the new Cathedral, to be located on Lafayette Square, began in 1873. The building, which was constructed of brick in the French Gothic style, served the parish until 1898, when the Cathedral caught fire and was almost completely burned. Reconstruction started almost immediately, and the Cathedral was rebuilt from the same plans, using the design by architect Francis Baldwin, who created many buildings throughout his career for the Catholic Church. The Cathedral was finished in 1900. The building has two spires, pointed arches and a large rose window, all characteristics of French Gothic. The interior has murals painted in New York in the renaissance style. The stained glass was created by Tyrolean artists in Austria. The main altar and the four side altars are made of Italian white marble. The exterior is brick that is stuccoed and whitewashed. The Cathedral was closed for 18 months between the spring of 1999 and the fall of 2000 for a major restoration to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the diocese and the 100th anniversary of the current building. Every surface was cleaned, and paintings and sculptures were restored to their original condition. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said of the work, The newly restored Cathedral of St. John the Baptist ... is a symphony of color and light and space, played out in stone and glass. The holy harmony within the neo-Gothic spires is a source of inspiration for those seeking artistic or architectural excellence, or simply a place to offer a quiet prayer.'' The Cathedral is one of the most popular attractions in Savannah. Reviews on travel websites use words like must-see,'' breathtaking,'' and amazing.'' There are no negative reviews. One visitor said, The beauty of the interior is unmatched in my experience. ... Just flat spectacular.'' Several travelers suggest visiting while the organ is playing to enhance the visual experience. This person perhaps does not exaggerate by saying, This is definitely the best attraction in Savannah.''"

This Christian Church offers Mass on Sundays at 8.30am and 11am, Monday through Friday at 12.10pm and at 9am on Sundays. Across the road from the church is Underground Atlanta, where visitors to the shrine can safely park their cars.  This is Atlanta's first Catholic Church and the oldest church in North Georgia with the original building having been built in 1848 by an Irish missionary called Father John Barry. The original building was damaged during the American Civil War and as a result the Catholics of Atlanta decided to erect a new church building on the same lot. Now visitors can arrange a tour of the church building by calling the office between 10am and 4.30 pm Monday to Friday. Visitors to the shrine will see its soaring ceilings, marble altars and stained glass windows in the sanctuary. The long center aisle and wonderful pipe organ makes this a good setting for a wedding, which can be scheduled here on Saturdays at 2pm, 5pm or 7.30pm and on Sundays at 3pm or 6pm. After both the Sunday Mass services the shrine Gift Shop is opened, where parishioners and guests can purchase religious items as well as pieces of folk art."

In what Vince Anthony, the center's Executive Director calls an institution-changing gift,'' the museum received several hundred puppets from the family of Jim Henson in 2008 and will open a Jim Henson Wing in 2012. The center performs at least a dozen shows every year, from classic, traditionally told stories to new and innovative performance pieces. The shows vary in age appropriateness, from those that are suitable for young children, to shows for teens and up, to performances for adult audiences only. A wide variety of puppets are featured, including marionettes, hand puppets, finger puppets and Japanese bunraku puppets, to name a few. The center also presents a film series. The museum at the center has 350 puppets on permanent display, including several of Jim Henson's creations and many styles of puppets from all over the world. Discovery Boxes scattered throughout the museum provide an interactive experience for children (and adults!). The center's collection has been enhanced by the Henson gift, which will eventually take up about half of the museum's space. In addition to the permanent exhibit, the center always has several special exhibitions on display. These may include tributes to certain artists, explanations of puppet making or the artistry of puppet performance. Educational programs at the center have been praised around the world. In-house programs include hands-on workshops for all ages and special training for teachers.

The center puts on four to six conferences a day throughout the school year, many of them to rural or otherwise underserved schools. Julia Heighway, of the Center for Interactive Learning, says the Center for Puppetry is always very highly rated by the teachers. ... They're one of our top providers.'' The center is mostly a hit with reviewers on the Internet. The Jim Henson puppets are especially popular, with one visitor calling the exhibit one of the greatest things I've seen in my life!'' Another person said of the experience, This place is wondrous, and proves that puppetry isn't always just kids' stuff.'' The children's workshops are also well-liked. Those who did not enjoy the center say that the museum was boring,'' or not what I expected.'' One woman cautions that visitors attending shows should call ahead so as not to be surprised by inappropriate content."

"The Ellis Hotel: Atlanta's Reborn Boutique","Georgia","The Ellis Hotel: Atlanta's Reborn Boutique","The Ellis Hotel, a boutique hotel in a historic downtown Atlanta building, is located on Peachtree Street, Atlanta's famous thoroughfare. Nearby attractions include Centennial Olympic Park, CNN Center, the Georgia Aquarium, the World of Coca-Cola, Philips Arena and the Georgia Dome. The hotel can be reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station one block away, and bus lines serve the area. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is 15 minutes away. The 15-story, 127-room Ellis, which opened in late 2007, is in one of the oldest buildings in downtown Atlanta. Built in 1913, it was originally known as the Winecoff Hotel. The Winecoff was one of the city's most successful hotels until 1946, when a fire broke out on the third floor and quickly spread to the upper floors. Although the building was constructed to early 20th century fireproof'' standards, it had no safety features to protect guests, and 119 people were killed in the fire. The Winecoff remains one of the worst hotel fire tragedies in the United States. It was responsible, however, for changing fire safety laws and procedures in multi-story buildings all across the country. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. According to the Georgia Historic Preservation Division, it is an excellent example of the Neoclassical Revival style in Atlanta built in the first decades of the 20th century and is among the few hotels from that time to survive in downtown Atlanta.'' The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) points out, While Ellis officials are trying to retain as much of the exterior's original design as possible, they are not being as rigid about decor inside the building. The interior furnishings will have a post-modern flair based on styles from the '40s and '50s.'' Most of the rooms are small but very stylishly appointed. The hotel features one executive suite, with a separate sitting room; 12 junior suites, with a living area not separate from the bedroom; and a women's only floor with secured entry, an extra pair of panty hose in each room, curling and straightening irons, and upgraded bath amenities. All rooms include luxury bedding, an in-room mini-bar and free wired high-speed Internet access. Wireless access is available in the public areas of the hotel. Other hotel features include a small fitness center, a business center and valet service. The Ellis has two meeting rooms that can accommodate up to 50 guests each. Dining at the Ellis is provided by Terrace, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Terrace uses locally sourced food whenever possible, and features such items as Georgia Organic Collards in a rich hamhock stock, Georgia Mountain Trout with Virginia blue crab brown butter, and Antebellum Yellow Hominy Grits, among other contemporary American fare. The New York Times says in its review of the Ellis, Though the Ellis's design may lack personality, its staff doesn't. They were helpful and kind ... when it comes to atmosphere, [the hotel] doesn't seem to hold much intrigue. Yet for those who want to avoid the chain hotels, it's an attractive option with a lovely restaurant.'' Reviewers on the Internet certainly seemed pleased; the hotel is, at this writing, the number two hotel in Atlanta based on ratings from users of tripadvisor.com. Eighty-eight percent give the hotel an Excellent'' or Very Good'' rating on that website. One recent guest said that the environment was refreshing and relaxing. Our room was very charming.'' The staff gets very high marks, and everyone loves the location. Another person says, I do love this place and it is walking distance to all kinds of great restaurants ... and all types of attractions.'' The price is also attractive to guests, with one guest noting that it is significantly less costly than nearby chain hotels.'' The hotel's general manager sums up the feeling at the hotel in the AJC, saying, The historical nature of the building is on the outside from the brick and the mortar and the location. But when you walk into the building, you are walking into the future."

Downtown Atlanta is only minutes away. The bank can be reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station about five blocks away, and bus lines also serve the area. Atlanta's new Federal Reserve building opened in 2001. The bank's employees had been spread among three buildings for several years, and the new 957,000-square-foot compound allowed the Fed to consolidate and upgrade their security to current standards. When the new bank opened, the Atlanta Business Chronicle said, What impresses people most about the building is its sheer size.'' The massive complex, actually two separate buildings, has a 65-foot-high, 500,000-cubic-foot, high-security cash processing facility as well as office space for 1,200 employees. The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, has twelve banks, each of which oversees a region of the country. Atlanta's region includes Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, as well as parts of Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana. The Fed's functions, according its website, are: Monetary policy, that is, keeping inflation and economic growth at proper levels through setting interest rates and regulating the money supply Bank supervision and regulation, which ensures that banks are stable and operating within the law Operation of a nationwide payment system, by providing cash to banks, wiring money and clearing checks A unique feature of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank is its Visitors Center and Monetary Museum. A fascinating visit for both children and adults, the Visitors Center and Museum uses artifacts, rare currency and interactive displays to educate the public about the history of money and the role of the Federal Reserve in everyday life. Its features include: The Story of Money, which relates the history of bartered objects and currency. The museum includes many rare artifacts, uncut sheets of old U.S. currency and a gold bar. Interactive features, in which visitors detect counterfeit currencies and can play banker,'' making financial decisions about monetary policy A view into the robotically operated bank vault, where cash buses'' move pallets of money around the floor Reviews of the Federal Reserve Visitors Center and Monetary Museum are very positive. Fodor's calls the Monetary Museum grand,'' and helloatlanta.com says it's a gem.'' While one visitor was concerned that small children who cannot read or who don't understand the value of money would not have enough to do, another says that the museum is small enough and has enough displays and demonstrations that the kids won't be bored.'' That same person rates the museum as VERY COOL!'' The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the center more educational than fun'' and stodgy.'' Most visitors agree with this reviewer, however, who said, What I did see was very interesting. And best of all, the whole thing is free.''"

The museum is located in the historic Druid Hills area, one of Atlanta's early suburbs and now one of its most exclusive in-town neighborhoods. Other attractions in the area include the Fernbank Science Center, the Michael C. Carlos Museum, the Schwartz Center for Performing Arts and the Carter Center. Fernbank is about ten minutes from both the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and Interstate 285. The Museum of Natural History sits in the middle of 65-acre Fernbank Forest, the largest old-growth urban Piedmont forest in the country. The 160,000-square-foot museum opened in 1992 with the mission of inspiring the learning of natural history, particularly, though not exclusively, through the context of Georgia's archaeological past. The museum's permanent exhibits include A Walk Through Time in Georgia, First Georgians and Conveyed in Clay, all of which concern Georgia's natural history. Other exhibits, though, include The World of Shells, a beautiful display of shells from around the world; and Reflections of Culture, a comparison of personal artifacts from many different historic and modern cultures. The most popular exhibit by far is Giants of the Mesozoic, which features Argentinosaurus, the largest dinosaur ever found, as well as Gigantosaurus, the largest meat-eater ever found. Frommer's online travel review says that it's a little hair-raising to walk into the hall and see these beasts towering over the tiny humans below.'' A popular draw at the museum is the IMAX theatre, which shows large-format films on its five-story-high, 72-foot wide screen. The theatre shows a rotating schedule of new and older IMAX films, including the popular Everest. Every Friday throughout the year (except in December), the museum has Martinis & IMAX,'' which features cocktails, live music, dining and a movie. The event is a Friday night institution in Atlanta and an entertaining way for adults to enjoy the museum. Fernbank offers other programs, as well, most of them geared toward families and children. Every August, the museum throws a birthday party for their dinosaurs, and every October they have Bugs, Bats and Bones Day'' to celebrate Halloween in an educational way. Each weekend brings Weekend Wonders,'' with interactive programs for children. The museum also hosts summer camps every year. Education and research are part of the museum's mission. Two of their most important programs are UrbanWatch and archaeological research on St. Catherines Island. UrbanWatch Atlanta teaches urban students how to interact with their local environments by participating in projects such as invasive plant removal and replanting of native species. The research on St. Catherines Island, one of Georgia's barrier islands, explores Georgia's Native American and Spanish Colonial history and places them in the context of world history. As the museum's website notes, The best archaeological research reveals something useful about the lives of people virtually anywhere, and careful study of human skeletons from St. Catherines Island has done just that.'' An official at New York's American Museum of Natural History said of Atlanta's museum, Fernbank has achieved an enormous amount of prestige in a short amount of time.'' Visitors, however, only rate the museum as Average'' on most travel websites. Not worth the money'' is a common complaint, and many think that the collection is small and not too impressive. The dinosaurs are everyone's favorite, and the urban forest is also popular. This visitor sums up the museum, saying, Overall, it's a decent experience. Nothing `must see' but still a fun time nonetheless.''"
"The Flat Iron Building: Atlanta's Oldest Skyscraper","Georgia","The Flat Iron Building: Atlanta's Oldest Skyscraper","The Flat Iron Building, properly known as the English-American Building, was the second skyscraper built in Atlanta and the oldest one still standing. The building is in downtown Atlanta in the oldest part of the business district. Nearby attractions include the Georgia State Capitol, the Fairlie-Poplar Historic District, the Georgia Dome, CNN Center, the Georgia Aquarium and Centennial Olympic Park. The building is located on Atlanta's legendary Peachtree Street and can be reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station two blocks away, and several bus lines serve the area. The eleven-story Flat Iron Building was built in 1897. It is the oldest surviving skyscraper in Atlanta and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It predates the famous building of the same name in New York by four years, although it took that building's name as a nickname around 1916. The name comes from the triangular shape of the building, thought to resemble an old-fashioned iron. The building was designed by Bradford Gilbert, a New York architect who was a pioneer of the steel-frame skyscraper. Gilbert was the supervising architect of Atlanta's 1895 Cotton States Exposition held in Piedmont Park. The structure is in the Chicago Style'' of architecture, characterized by its steel frame and large, street-level windows. The Flat Iron Building is one of the anchors of the Fairlie-Poplar Historic District, the oldest part of Atlanta's business district. The district includes, according to the National Park Service, the largest concentrated collection of commercial and office buildings in Atlanta from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.'' The Flat Iron remains important for several reasons. First, of course, is the fact that it is the oldest skyscraper in the city. Additionally, Dr. Elizabeth Lyon, who was Chief of Historic Preservation for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, says, The building plays an important role in its urban setting by establishing a sense of dignity and scale and helping to create a visually interesting sequence of spaces and styles in the central business area of the city.''  The structure, fronted on one side by a park and another by Broad Street, which is filled with retail stores and restaurants, has assured that the Flatiron Building remains at the center of a very active pedestrian confluence, reminiscent of 19th and early 20th century urban settings. ... [Now in] its second century, the Flatiron Building provides a vital, urban continuum,'' according to the Atlanta Urban Design Commission. Finally, rather than being turned into boutique residential condos or simply abandoned, the Flat Iron is still a vibrant office building. Its offices are leased by attorneys, architects and other professional downtown businesses. The ground-level storefronts are still thriving restaurants, cafes and retail stores. The interior of the Flat Iron has been remodeled several times, and very little remains of the original. On the exterior, however, the building has remained remarkably unchanged. One online reviewer said, This is an pretty good downtown building, especially in a city with edifices of minimal architectural interest.'' Given Atlanta's (somewhat unfair) reputation for destroying its historic structures, the Flat Iron Building is a treasure indeed."

"The Fox Theatre: Atlanta's Fabulous and Historic Movie Palace","Georgia","The Fox Theatre: Atlanta's Fabulous and Historic Movie Palace","Atlanta's fabulous Fox Theatre is a 1920s-era movie palace-turned-performing arts space located in Midtown Atlanta's business district. The Fox is located on Atlanta's legendary Peachtree Street and can be accessed easily from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. The building is a National Historic Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and a Georgia Museum Building. Built in the late 1920s as the Yaarab Temple Shrine Mosque, the Fox is an architectural fantasy of Arabian and Egyptian themes, complete with onion domes and minarets. The interior is filled with lavish moldings, fixtures and trompe l'oeil painting. A striped canopy resembling the interior of a desert tent overhangs the balcony, and the ceiling features twinkling stars and clouds that drift through the sky. The Shriners needed money to fund the mosque, so they turned to movie mogul William Fox, who was building gaudy movie palaces around the country. Soon, the Fox was one of Atlanta's most successful movie houses. In the 1970s, suburban multiplexes threatened to shut down the Fox's movie business, and Atlanta's growth as a business center threatened the Fox's very existence. Companies wanted the land for office space, and the building was nearly torn down. A Save the Fox'' campaign was waged for four years by a non-profit organization committed to protecting the landmark, and the theatre has been successful ever since. The 4,000-seat theatre is booked an average of 325 nights a year. It has hosted national touring companies of such blockbuster shows as A Chorus Line,'' Cats,'' and Phantom of the Opera.'' The current season of shows includes Grease,'' Mamma Mia'' and Rain: The Beatles Experience.'' The Fox frequently sets attendance records nationwide for shows and is one of the premier venues in the country for theatres of its size. The Delta International Series at the Fox brings performers from around the world to Atlanta, including the St. Petersburg Ballet, the Chieftains and Tango Buenos Aires. Individual concerts also sell out the theatre with performers like Rob Thomas, Kathy Griffin and Robin Williams. Another popular annual event at the Fox is the Coca-Cola Film Festival, which returns the theatre to its movie-palace origins. First-run movies run throughout the summer, preceded by sing-along concerts with Mighty Mo.'' Mo is the affectionate nickname for the 1929 Mtzller organ that rises up out of the stage on a platform. The 3,622-pipe organ is the second largest theatre organ in the US, only behind the Wurlitzer at Radio City Music Hall. Tours of the Fox are available from the Atlanta Preservation Center that show the inner workings'' of the theatre, including the original coal-fired boilers and one of the oldest air-conditioning systems in the U.S. The Fox Theatre Institute, one of the most active theatre preservation organizations in the country, works to preserve old theatres around Georgia and the nation using the experience of the Save the Fox'' campaign and the ongoing preservation work at the Fox as models for communities who wish to preserve their artistic heritage. Indeed, Atlanta has done a fine job of saving the fabulous Fox for generations to come."

The Glenn can be accessed from either Interstate 20 or the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station in the adjacent CNN Center. Bus lines also serve the area. The 10-story, 110-room Glenn Hotel occupies a 1923 office building that was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. In 2003, Central Atlanta Progress, an economic development group, listed the Glenn Building as one of downtown's biggest eyesores. Four years later, the building's owners won an Excellence in Rehabilitation Award from the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation for their restoration efforts in turning the building into a viable property again. The Glenn was the first independent boutique hotel in the city. The president of the company that owns the hotel said in the Atlanta Business Chronicle (ABC), For travelers looking for a more intimate experience, it represents something quite different from those `big-box hotels.''' The hotel maintains its Neoclassical exterior while replacing the interior with ultra-chic, contemporary dycor. The hotel's rooms come in four grades - Superior, Luxe, the Dream Suite, and the Sweet Suite. The Superior room, at 220 square feet, and the Luxe room, at 260 square feet, comprise most of the hotel. Luxe rooms are on the front of the building and overlook the park or view the Atlanta skyline. The 15 Dream Suites are 450 square feet and come with two televisions and a separate parlor. Some suites have an open glass shower that is only separated from the bedroom by a glass wall. The hotel's one Sweet Suite, on the top floor, is 850 square feet and comes with one-and-a-half baths, a large living room, a spectacular park view and a dining table. All rooms have complimentary wired and wireless Internet access and Herman Miller Aeron chairs at the work desk, along with standard amenities. Other features of the hotel include a small fitness center and a new business center that was added two years after the hotel opened. The ABC describes the center as having wireless Internet, lounge seating, computer stations and an LCD flat-screen TV displaying real-time airport arrivals and departures. ... `It's similar to a first-class lounge in the Delta Crown Room,' said [a hotel representative].'' As for dining, the Glenn is already on its third restaurant, the first two, both from out of town, having failed. This time, local restaurant group Concentrics, owner of several popular spots in Atlanta, has opened 30 Tables, which will serve contemporary American fare all day long. Concentrics is also revamping the rooftop bar of the Glenn, which offers a hip, young scene'' for the after-work crowd. Internet reviews of the Glenn Hotel have been mixed. A little over half of reviewers on one popular travel website rate the hotel Excellent'' or Very Good,'' but fully one-third rate it Poor'' or Terrible.'' One guest complimented the staff, saying, To a person, they were genuine, helpful, pleasant, funny.'' Another love[s] the rooftop bar at night. It is very romantic and the view is great.'' Many people complain about the noise, however, from both the street and the rooftop bar. The small size of the rooms is also an issue. Some guests love the dycor, the rooms and the peek-a-boo'' showers, while others find those same things tasteless. There seems to be no consensus on this hotel. The New York Times said, While the Glenn is not a bad place to stay, it could do without some of its tedious affectations.'' On the other hand, the Professional Travel Guide thinks that the glamorous and spacious suites are among the nicest in the city. ... This place is ... the pinnacle of cool hostelry in Atlanta.''"
"The Golf Club at Cuscowilla","Georgia","The Golf Club at Cuscowilla, Eatonton, Georgia - A Lovely Walk in the Park on a Beautifully Designed Golf Course","The semi-private Golf Club at Cuscowilla is not considered a flashy'' course with gimmicks and gadgets. Rather, designers Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw tend to take a minimalist approach in their designs, and Cuscowilla is more like a lovely walk in the park.  A good way to describe this course is that, among the native flora, wild grasses and tall Georgia pines, someone snuck a golf course into the beautiful scenery.'' Coore and Crenshaw might have been aiming for balance and for affording the greatest golfing pleasure to the greatest number of players. The course, which borders Lake Oconee in Georgia, is both playable and enjoyable for the high-handicapper, while still intriguing to more skilled players. The par-70 course plays to 6,847 yards at the tips, with a USGA course rating of 72.2 and a slope rating of 132 on Bermuda over Rye fairways. Two holes play alongside Lake Oconee, but perhaps the most distinctive feature of the course is its red-sand bunkers, the result of white sand and red Georgia clay commingling after a few rain storms. The bunkers tend to be deep and large, often with rugged edges and non-geometric shapes. The course offers good pacing and variety in its holes, with lengthy holes on 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, and 18. One of the most noteworthy holes on the course is the 425-yard No. 10, considered to be one of the finest modern Cape'' holes in the country. No. 10 is a mirror image is the famous No. 5 Cape hole at the Mid Ocean Club in Bermuda - one of the most photographed and copied holes in golf. The Cuscowilla version begins with a dramatic tee shot off an elevated tee over the finger of Lake Oconee, followed by a iron shot to the green and its lone bunker. Real trouble can be found with a shot to the left, where a steep, closely mown bank awaits, as well as to the right where the bunker and water await wayward approach shots. Another noteworthy hole is the 11th that follows. At a meager 135 yards, golfers might be over-confident as they step up to the tee. The green, however, is one of the most severe on the course, including a false front that covers the left third of the green and a slope on the right that will carry a wayward tee shot into the water. All the greens feature bentgrass, and are in pristine condition, which is par for this course. They tend to play fast and are nicely contoured, with good slope and undulations. Among the course's accolades and honors are being ranked #19 among the Top 100 Course in America'' by Golf Magazine, and being rated #3 Best Residential Golf Courses in America'' by Golfweek. Practice facilities, private lessons and a Pro Shop are available. The course is open to the public Tuesday through Thursday. The resort offers a number of amenities to members and guests, such as: massage therapy, swimming, tennis and seven miles of water frontage on Lake Oconee. There's also a Kid's Club located by the outdoor pool, with activities such as tennis, basketball, swing set, along with indoor activities and games. For dining, members and guests can choose from the casual Golf House Grill, featuring breakfast and lunch, and the acclaimed Waterside Restaurant for more elegant fare."
"The Goodwin House","Georgia","The Goodwin House","The Goodwin House is located on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia and is approximately a 25 minutes drive from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The house sits on over an acre of trees and grass and is the remains of a 600-acre farm that was owned in the 1830s by Solomon Goodwin. The house is open to the public every third Sunday of the month between 1pm and 4pm.  Solomon Goodwin was the father of Harris, who was the first white settler in the area, which was once Creek Indian land. The wood frame home and a small graveyard where the father and son are buried are all that remain of the farm, which helped to feed Civil War refugees and the poor during the Great Depression. It is the oldest existing house in DeKalb County and is still owned by descendants of the Goodwin family, who are usually there to serve as guide to visitors. After taking a tour of the farmhouse and listening to its rich history, visitors may like to find a place to eat nearby. One option is Mellow Mushroom Pizza, which can be found along Peachtree Road. On a hot day visitors can cool down with ice cream from Bruster's Ice Cream, which is just a short walk from Goodwin House."
"The Green-Meldrim House: Savannah's Home to General Sherman","Georgia","The Green-Meldrim House: Savannah's Home to General Sherman","The Green-Meldrim House is an ornate house-museum in Savannah's Historic District that served as General Sherman's headquarters while he was in Savannah. The house is in the southern half of the District and is within walking distance of Forsyth Park and the Savannah History Museum. CAT, Savannah's public transit system, provides a free downtown shuttle that passes within a block of the house. The Green-Meldrim House was built for Charles Green, a cotton merchant who made his fortune in the years before the Civil War. In 1850, Green decided he wanted a house befitting his wealth, and he engaged architect John Norris to build it for him. Norris, originally from New York, began working in Savannah in 1848, when he was commissioned to build the Savannah Custom House. He became the city's most important architect during the 1850s, designing the Andrew Low House, the Massie School Building and the Mercer-Williams House, among other important structures. The New Georgia Encyclopedia says the Green-Meldrim House is his best-known'' work and is among the earliest Gothic revival houses in the state.'' The house, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, is described by the National Park Service as a splendid display of the grandeur of mid-19th century Savannah high society. Gothic Revival in style, its rococo mirrors, marble mantels, intricately carved moldings, and luxuries such as gas lighted domes show the lavish construction.'' Interiors magazine adds, Of particular interest are its graceful curved stairway crowned by a skylight rotunda, drawing rooms outfitted with Carrera marble mantels and Austrian mirrors in gold leaf frames, and the oriel windows on the east side of the house.'' Savannah historian Hugh Golson said in the Savannah Morning News (SMN), Norris took the Gothic Revival style to new heights at the Green-Meldrim. It boasts many architectural innovations, including a series of sliding doors, oriel windows and an experimental dome over the staircase.'' Golson goes on to say that the house would be at or near the top'' of a list of the best houses in Savannah. The Green-Meldrim House, for all its architectural significance, has a brief, but significant role in history, too. In 1864, when General Sherman arrived in Savannah, Charles Green rode out to him and offered him his house in the hope that Sherman would not destroy it. Sherman says in his memoirs, After riding about the city, and finding his house so spacious, so convenient, with large yard and stabling, I accepted his offer. ... a most excellent house it was in all respects.'' It was from this house that Sherman sent his famous cable to President Lincoln, saying, I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the City of Savannah.'' Today, the house is owned by St. John's Episcopal Church, which uses part of the house as its rectory. It has maintained the house and keeps it open to the public for tours. A major restoration project started in 2009, thanks to a grant from Save America's Treasures. A local architect working on the project notes in the SMN, It was an honor, and a reflection of the house's history and importance, to be chosen for the grant. Only 40 sites were chosen, and the Green-Meldrim House was the only one from Georgia.'' Internet reviews are very positive for the Green-Meldrim House. Visitors are taken with both the architecture and the history. It really felt like we stepped back in time,'' says one tourist. Another suggests, If you see only one home in Savannah, make this the one.''"
"The Hamilton-Turner House: Savannah's Grand Victorian Lady","Georgia","The Hamilton-Turner House: Savannah's Grand Victorian Lady","The Hamilton-Turner House, now an inn, is a Second Empire home built in 1873 that is nicknamed the Grand Victorian Lady.'' The house is located on Lafayette Square in the Historic District of downtown Savannah. Lafayette Square is home to the Andrew Low House, the Flannery O'Connor House and the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. The Hamilton-Turner House is also within walking distance of the Green-Meldrim House and Forsyth Park. The Historic District can be reached from Interstate 16. CAT, Savannah's public transit system, has a free downtown shuttle that stops very near the Hamilton-Turner House. The house was built in 1873 for Samuel Pugh Hamilton, who would become mayor of Savannah. He and his wife entertained lavishly, and wanted a house to suit that need. It was the first home is Savannah to have electricity. The house is built in the Second Empire style of architecture, a mid-Victorian era style characterized by quoins, or prominent cornerstones, a very steep mansard roof and iron accents. The house was nearly demolished in 1965 when the Cathedral wanted the land for a parking deck, but it was saved by the Historic Savannah Foundation. Before the house became an inn, it was a site on tours for Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, known from the book as Mandy's house.'' In 1997, it became the Hamilton-Turner Inn. The inn, a AAA Four Diamond award winner, offers 17 rooms and suites, each decorated with its own style. Some rooms have a private garden entrance and some are in the separate carriage house, which can also be rented as one unit. All rooms come with bathrobes, complimentary wireless high-speed Internet service, and luxury bed and bath amenities. Some rooms have extras like fireplaces, balconies and claw-foot tubs. Each room is named for a prominent figure in Savannah history, and a guest could get a fairly complete history of the city just by studying the room names. The inn provides a full Southern breakfast every morning, afternoon tea, early evening wine and hors d'oeuvres and late evening port. Access to a fitness facility is complimentary. Forbes calls it one of the city's chicest bed and breakfasts.'' Several packages are available at the inn. The Christmas package invites guests to spend Christmas Day at the Hamilton-Turner and have a traditional Southern Christmas dinner. A carriage ride through the city the next day is included. The Romantic package includes chilled champagne upon arrival, a bouquet of roses and an $80 gift certificate to an area restaurant. The Elopement package provides a minister or justice of the peace, champagne and a small cake, although the inn can arrange anything the couple wants with advance notice. Internet reviews of the Hamilton-Turner Inn are overwhelmingly good. Nearly 90 percents of guest on one popular website give it an Excellent'' or Very Good'' rating. One woman starts her review by saying she always thought it would be nice'' to stay there, but she was wrong. It turns out that her stay was wonderful!'' She highly recommend[s] this to anyone that wants to be treated like a king or queen.'' The service and the breakfasts get wonderful compliments. This woman sums up her visit to the inn, saying The Hamilton-Turner is flat out the best overall inn my husband and I have every stayed in.''"
"The Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge: Savannah's Birding Paradise","Georgia","The Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge: Savannah's Birding Paradise","The Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge is located about an hour's drive south of Savannah along the South Newport River near the Georgia coast. The refuge can be reached from Interstate 95. Harris Neck is one of a series of refuges on the coast that form the Savannah Coastal Refuges Complex. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS), which administers the refuges, because they are located on the Atlantic Flyway, the islands are important to migrating waterfowl.'' Many endangered and threatened species nest here, especially in the rookeries of Harris Neck. The 2,762-acre Harris Neck refuge has a fascinating history. In 1864, after slavery ended, a group of African Americans settled at Harris Neck and had small but thriving farms. They lived there until 1942, when the federal government seized the land to build an airport as part of the country's coastal defense against German submarines. Georgia Trend tells what happened next: The government promised to return the land after World War II. Instead, the 2,700 acres fell into the hands of [local] county leaders, who said they needed it for an airfield, but used it for private enterprises, including a drag strip, gambling joint and house of ill repute.'' In 1962, the federal government, disgusted by the misuse of the land, took it back and created the Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge. Melissa Fay Greene's book Praying for Sheetrock details this period of the area's history. Because of its position between the inland coast and the outer barrier islands, Harris Neck has a wide variety of habitats, including, according to the FWS, salt marsh, mud flats, thickets, open fields, freshwater impoundments, and mixed pine-hardwood forest.'' This variety is what makes the area appealing to so many different types of wildlife. In addition, several manmade ponds are maintained by the FWS to act as nesting and feeding areas. During the summer, these ponds host wading birds like egrets and herons, but the FWS is most interested in the endangered wood stork. Harris Neck is a favorite breeding ground for the bird, which has been making a comeback. Billy Brooks, who oversees the recovery of the stork for the FWS, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that, in the next few years, ... it is possible the stork species' status will be changed from endangered to threatened.'' During the winter, smaller water birds, mostly ducks by the thousands, gather at the refuge. Songbirds like warblers, buntings, vireos and thrushes are common during migrations. Raptors like kestrels, harriers, falcons, ospreys and bald eagles can be seen be seen hunting at any time of the year. Other wildlife in the refuge includes many animals common to Georgia, like the opossum, armadillo and white-tailed deer. Several 12-foot alligators are also known to live at Harris Neck. There is no visitor's center at the refuge, but there are fifteen miles of roads and trails that can reach most habitats on the island. Deer hunting is permitted seasonally by permit, and there are two fishing piers. Feral hog hunts are occasionally scheduled, as hogs destroy the habitats of the other wildlife. Educational programs can be created for any group by contacting the FWS. Internet reviews of the wildlife refuge are consistent - If you enjoy wildlife and especially birds, Harris Neck is not to be missed.'' Birders, photographers and casual hikers all agree that this is a stunningly beautiful, peaceful place. One woman said, I love this place because it takes me away from the real world and I love the birds!'' The Sherpa Guide lauds the efforts of the Fish & Wildlife Service, saying that the freshwater ponds and dikes ... represent an excellent example of wetland management.'' Harris Neck is not only a refuge for wildlife; it would seem to be a refuge for us, too."

"The Historic District: Savannah's Jewel","Georgia","The Historic District: Savannah's Jewel","The Historic District of Savannah is considered to be one of the most beautiful old cities in America. The district is located in downtown Savannah in the northeast corner of the city along the Savannah River. Interstate 16 dead ends into the Historic District. Chatham Area Transit (CAT), the area's public transit system, offers a free shuttle that serves many of the attractions in the Historic District. The area is also easy to explore on foot. The Savannah Historic District is a National Historic Landmark. According to the National Park Service, the district is significant for its distinctive grid plan as well as its 18th and 19th century architecture.'' Few cities in America have retained their colonial plans as well as Savannah. The city was laid out in its grid pattern by General James Oglethorpe, who founded the city in 1733. Oglethorpe's plan, based on an egalitarian belief that each homeowner should have equal assets and access to open areas, started with a square-shaped piece of land called a Ward.'' At the center of each ward was a Square'' surrounded by four groups of ten houses each. Each ward also included four Trustees Lots'' which were meant for community buildings such as churches or government buildings. Oglethorpe envisioned six wards, all of which were completed by 1742. As the city grew, developers maintained the ward system. The city grew to 24 wards, although three of those squares were eventually demolished. Although Oglethorpe's houses were of a small, plain egalitarian design, as the city's wealth grew throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these houses began to be replaced by the grand planters' and merchants' homes that are there today. Historian Mills Lane, in Savannah Revisited: A Pictorial History, quotes an 1833 report that says, What constitutes its beauty is the manner in which the city is laid out. ... These manifold grassy parks [the squares] ... are very picturesque and inviting, and highly suggestive of health and comfort.'' Today the Historic District is replete with private homes, house museums, inns and B&Bs, shopping, world-class restaurants and, of course, those inviting squares. Among a few of the many treasures in the Historic District are the: Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, a French Gothic-style Catholic church built in 1876. Jepson Center for the Arts, part of the Telfair Museum of Arts, with a collection of contemporary art in a stunning new building. Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace and National Girl Scout Center. First African Baptist Church, once a way station on the Underground Railroad. Downtown Design District, a collection of antique, arts and crafts and gift shops. Owens-Thomas House and Museum, a house museum that is considered one of the finest examples of Regency architecture in the United States. Riverwalk, an old brick concourse along the Savannah River, with shops, restaurants and views of the port. Almost no one dislikes Savannah's Historic District. Even General Sherman couldn't stand to burn it! (Instead he presented it to President Lincoln as a Christmas present.) Reviewers on popular travel websites call it a breathtaking experience'' with a near perfect balance of neighborhood feel mixed with a Southern sophistication.'' Those who were not happy with their trip cite the lack of nightlife and the fact that its main draw is historical. Also, most visitors caution others to wear comfortable footwear because many streets are made of cobblestones and old brick. Cassandra M. Vanhooser, writing for Southern Living, says of the Historic District, When people find out that I'm a travel writer, they always ask, `Where's your favorite place?' ... All roads lead to Savannah.''"

"The Hotel Row Neighborhood: Atlanta's Original Business District","Georgia","The Hotel Row Neighborhood: Atlanta's Original Business District","The Hotel Row Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the oldest remaining block of Atlanta's downtown business district. It is located in the heart of downtown near Five Points, the historic center of Atlanta, where the rail lines and, before that, Native American trade routes, came together. The area is accessible from Interstate 20 and the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. Nearby attractions include the Georgia Dome, Philips Arena, CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park, the Georgia Aquarium, and the World of Coca-Cola. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has three train stations within walking distance of Hotel Row. Hotel Row itself is a single block of old hotels and commercial buildings that have been converted into other businesses. The hotels were around the corner from Atlanta's Terminal Station, its main railroad station, built in 1905; travelers looking for a place to stay encountered these hotels as soon as they left the station. By the 1920s, the convenience of automobile travel led train passengers to newer, more comfortable hotels further away, and Hotel Row went into decline. The block includes: Concordia Hall. Concordia Hall is the oldest building on Hotel Row, according to the National Park Service, and the only building to survive a 1908 fire that destroyed the rest of the block. It was built no later than 1895 as a Jewish Community Center, especially, according to the Atlanta Urban Design Commission, successful young businessmen who ... wished to foster their cultural heritage. Dramatic performances, music and literary gatherings, debates and card playing took place in the club.'' An 1895 item in the New York Times mentions a B'nai B'rith Convention in Atlanta that would be holding a grand ball at the hall. A lyre, symbolic of the arts, remains on the fazade of the building. By 1912, Southern Railway owned the building and used it to house workers. The building currently holds several retail businesses. The Gordon Hotel. The Gordon Hotel is a three-story brick building that was converted into the Gordon Lofts in 1996. The building has 19 loft units that range from 785 to 1,373 square feet in size. The Scoville Hotel. The Scoville Hotel is a three-story building that operated as a hotel until 2001. According to Creative Loafing, the hotel came to resemble a Bowery flophouse and was used frequently for film shoots,'' including RoboCop III and a Rolling Stones video. The building has retained some interesting architectural details, including a black-and-white checkerboard tile floor with Scoville'' laid in red tile at the entrance. An unnamed commercial building. The three-story red brick building contains retail businesses. The Sylvan Hotel. The Sylvan was also built to house railroad workers and their guests. The building was renovated in 1987 and today contains residential and office lofts, as well as retail and restaurant space. Hotel Row is part of Atlanta's South Central Business District (CBD), the oldest part of downtown. The South CBD is the home of Atlanta's main city, county, state and federal government buildings. The area is the subject of intense focus from city planners, who want to bring more residential and retail activity to the area. Central Atlanta Progress (CAP), a private organization that encourages economic development in downtown Atlanta, believes that the area is becoming a hub of authentic loft residential development in former ... hotels ... and other commercial buildings.'' A.J. Robinson, CAP's president, was quoted in February 2009 in the Atlanta Business Chronicle as saying that the area is primed for redevelopment.'' Atlanta's history buffs hope that Hotel Row can make a comeback as a center of the city's downtown life."
"The Hurt Building: Atlanta's Grand Old Skyscraper Goes ``Green''","Georgia","The Hurt Building: Atlanta's Grand Old Skyscraper Goes ``Green''","The Hurt Building, one of Atlanta's oldest skyscrapers, is located downtown in the oldest part of the Central Business District. Nearby attractions include the Georgia Aquarium, CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park, the World of Coca-Cola and Turner Field. The building can be easily reached from either the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector or Interstate 20. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station about two blocks away, and several bus lines serve the area. Construction on the Hurt Building started in 1913. The main part of the building was completed within a year, but the wings and light court of the building, as well as some decoration, were not finished until 1926. The delay was caused in part by World War I. At the time it was built, the Hurt Building was the 17th largest office building in the world. Joel Hurt, the builder, was an Atlanta businessman who had already reshaped the city. In the late 1880s, Hurt purchased land about two miles east of downtown and designed a neighborhood laid out in the garden style.'' Neighborhoods such as these were designed to give city dwellers a place of repose surrounded by natural beauty. Hurt was creating Atlanta's first suburb, Inman Park, now one of the most desirable in-town neighborhoods in the city. At the same time, Hurt created a new street, Edgewood Avenue, that ran straight from downtown to Inman Park. He then engineered and built a streetcar line along the new street that took commuters to their new homes outside the city. It was at the downtown end of Edgewood that he decided to build his skyscraper. Hurt did many of the preliminary architectural drawing for his building himself. To do the actual design, he hired J. E. R. Carpenter, who the New York Times called the architect who shaped Upper Fifth Avenue.'' The 17-story building is triangular, or a flat iron,'' as these buildings are called, because of the odd shape of its lot. It is built in the Neoclassical style, with a domed rotunda at the apex of the triangle that is set on marble columns. The lines of the building are straight and regular, and ornamentation is kept to a minimum. The National Park Service says, The Hurt Building also reflects the ideas and concepts of its builder, Joel Hurt. [His] training as an engineer helped ... as he strove to keep the frills of design down to a minimum and sought to create a more efficient and direct approach to design for the sake of clarity and unity.'' The Hurt Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. The building remains a vibrant part of downtown. American City Business Journals said of the Hurt Building, in discussing its high occupancy rate with good-quality tenants, Today, it is an increasingly vital part of the downtown business district and an example of the evolving role that historic buildings can play in the life of the community.'' The owners of the building continue to maintain the Hurt Building as premier office space, adding high-speed Internet access and other modern amenities. In addition, the building was recently awarded LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. According to Electrical Wholesaling, the Hurt Building is the first commercial building in downtown Atlanta to achieve the prestigious LEED-EB Gold certification, which denotes a high-level of commitment to sustainable operations and maintenance of an existing facility.'' The National Park Service says that the building remains one of the most highly visible and architecturally important examples of early skyscraper construction in Atlanta.'' Joel Hurt would be pleased that his building continues to lead the way into the future."
"The Hyatt Regency: Atlanta's","Georgia","The Hyatt Regency: Atlanta's, and the World's, First Modern Atrium Hotel","The Hyatt Regency, architect John Portman's first atrium hotel, is located in downtown Atlanta on Peachtree Street. The hotel is within walking distance of Centennial Olympic Park, the Georgia Dome, the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, Philips Arena and CNN Center. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station one block away. The hotel is easily reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. In 1961, John Portman, a real estate developer as well as an architect, created the Merchandise Mart in downtown Atlanta. It was so successful that, by the mid-1960s, he felt the city needed a new downtown hotel to accommodate all of the out-of-town buyers at the Mart. The hotel he designed, a 23-story concrete block hollowed out in the middle to create a 21-story atrium, was so radical in its concept that he could not find a chain with which to affiliate. Finally, Hyatt, a west-coast motor lodge operator, took a chance on the building, creating its first full-service hotel. The result was a hotel that, at 40-plus years of age, still has the power to awe guests as well as draw top conventions to the city. When it opened in 1967, the Hyatt Regency was more than a hotel - it was a tourist attraction. People lined up to ride its glass elevators to the top of the hotel, which was capped with a rotating restaurant inside a blue glass bubble. The space-age bubble, lit from within, glowed over the Atlanta skyline at night like a monument to the future,'' said the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. An Atlanta native recalls in the AJC, In high school, we all went down and rode the elevators. And you got dressed up. It was a big thing to do.'' Today, the rotating restaurant is closed, but the Hyatt Regency remains an integral part of the downtown convention trade. It underwent a 22-million-dollar renovation in time for its 40th anniversary in 2007. Successful Meetings, a trade magazine of the convention industry, sponsors the Pinnacle Awards, which recognize excellence in convention hotels. In describing the Hyatt Regency's award in 2008 - the 16th time the property had won a Pinnacle - the magazine said, The property's legacy for innovation-in design, service, and meetings facilities-continues as the hotel consistently upgrades its group offerings.'' In addition to upgrading its meeting facilities, guestrooms and public spaces were redesigned to give the hotel a fresh, contemporary feel. The Hyatt's 1,260 rooms offer the signature Hyatt Grand Bed, high-speed wireless Internet access, a large work desk, bathrobes and upgraded baths. Rooms range from the small, studio-style Radius room to large suites with separate seating areas. A club level is available with a dedicated concierge, complimentary food and drink in the lounge and upgraded amenities. Dining options in the hotel include an upscale, bistro-style grill, a breakfast and lunch buffet, and two bars. A 5,000-square-foot, fully equipped fitness center is open 24 hours a day, and an outdoor pool is open seasonally. A staffed business center offering printing, desktop publishing and shipping is available six days a week. The massive meeting and convention facilities at the Hyatt, a total of 180,000 square feet, include the largest ballroom in the state at 29,000 square feet, which accommodates up to 2,200 guests banquet-style; 58,000 square feet of exhibit space, which accommodates up to 253 8' x 10' booths, and a total of 52 meeting rooms, including 14 Executive Suites and a 19-room conference center. Onsite planners and technology experts are available to assist with meetings, and the hotel provides full catering services. Internet reviews of the Hyatt Regency are largely positive, particularly since the renovation. Everyone, of course, is amazed by the atrium, and most guests like the new d,cor, although some find the Radius studio rooms too small. The staff is hospitable and courteous,'' and the fitness center is the best I've ever seen in a hotel.'' Most reviewers love the location near Atlanta's downtown attractions, although some are not comfortable in this part of town. One major complaint is prices - of valet parking, food, refreshments and Internet access. Another complaint is noise - Do not stay here if you need quiet!'' - as guests in some parts of the hotel can hear both lobby and street noise. All in all, the Hyatt Regency seems to be holding its own after forty years of service under the blue bubble."

This part of the Atlanta metro area has been to slower to develop than Atlanta's northern fringes, and the mall has proven to be an economic engine for the area. New housing and commercial development have followed Stonecrest, bringing a modern upscale vibe to the eastern edge of the city. The trade area of the mall extends into several counties to the south and east of downtown Atlanta and includes approximately half-a-million people. Located along Atlanta's major east-west corridor, Interstate 20, the mall has brought some long-overdue upscale retail and entertainment to this predominantly African-American part of the city. In fact, the mall's trade area is growing faster than Atlanta as a whole. The mall was envisioned as a hub for the live-work-play'' concept, in which area residents can fulfill all their needs without commuting. Former Dekalb County CEO Liane Levetan says that this is Georgia's first true smart-growth area,'' favorably comparing the development to projects like the Mall of Georgia, which she believes encourage Atlanta residents to drive long distances for their shopping and entertainment. Stonecrest's five anchors include Macy's, Dillard's, Sears, JCPenney, and Kohl's, which replaced original anchor Parisian in 2008. Other retailers in the mall include such national, upscale stores as Ann Taylor Loft, Aeropostale, and Charlotte Russe, along with local favorites like Barbecue Works, Cleopatra's Hair Salon, and BeauDefi. The mall also features a 16-screen cinema and an indoor/outdoor Food Court Pavilion. The Mall at Stonecrest hosts many events every year that are popular in the community. These include: The AMC Summer MovieCamp, which offers popular children's movies every summer for a one-dollar admission price. The proceeds of the MovieCamp are donated to charities like the Will Rogers Foundation. The Small Business Expo, held every April, which features exhibitors' booths, seminars for business owners and Best of'' awards to local businesses. The Women's Expo, held in October, which showcases many issues important to women, from health to fashion to business. The Adoption and Family Expo. Every August, the mall presents this unique opportunity for area families. Co-sponsored by the Georgia Department of Human Resources, the Expo attempts to connect families with some of the over 16,000 Georgia children who live in foster care. The Health Expo, which offers screenings, seminars and tests for many different health issues, particularly those affecting the African-American community. Crime has been a problem at the Mall at Stonecrest. In particular, unaccompanied teenagers have been gathering at the mall and hanging out.'' The crimes associated with this behavior are not necessarily serious, but mall officials believe the habit is driving away shoppers. As of May 2009, Stonecrest put into place a policy that prohibits unaccompanied teenagers in the mall after 4 PM on Fridays and Saturdays. Stonecrest is one of only 57 malls in the country to take this proactive step, which officials hope will not only lower the local crime rate, but promote a more family-friendly shopping environment."

The approximately 1.8 million- square-foot mall opened in 1999. It is still the largest mall in the state of Georgia and the 14th-largest in the country. The mall's trade area extends over most of northeast Georgia and into South Carolina and includes over two million people. According to the Arbitron Company, the Mall of Georgia is the preferred shopping destination, ranking number one, among all 33 malls in the Atlanta direct marketing area. The Mall of Georgia is in Gwinnett County, one of Georgia's largest and most economically dynamic counties. Gwinnett County is consistently one of the fastest growing counties in the nation. It is home to many national and international headquarters, and the population is affluent and ethnically diverse. Gwinnett has a higher-than-average percentage of families with young children, and the Mall of Georgia seeks to capitalize on that demographic. When the mall was built in 1999, Gwinnett County was the largest county in the United States that had only one mall. Its design was innovative at the time. It incorporates aspects of the traditional indoor shopping mall, the drive-up-and-shop power center'' and an entertainment complex with a cinema and attractions. A unique architectural feature is the Village, an outdoor area adjacent to storefront retail, meant to replicate the feel of small-town Georgia. The Village features caf, seating for nearby restaurants and a decorative fountain. Four of the mall's five original anchors - Macy's, Dillard's, JCPenney and Nordstrom - are still in place. The high-end retailer Lord & Taylor, which pulled out of the Georgia market in 1993, was replaced by the more middle-of-the-road Belk. Despite the loss of Lord & Taylor, there is still plenty of high-end shopping to be done at the Mall of Georgia in stores like Ann Taylor, Coach, A/X Armani Exchange, Pottery Barn, and Restoration Hardware. The Mall of Georgia is as much an entertainment destination as a shopping mall. The family entertainment options include: A 500-seat outdoor amphitheater. The venue hosts the popular annual Summer Concert Series and Movies Under the Stars,'' as well as other live performances and demonstrations. An IMAX theatre. One of four in the state, the 72-foot-high screen shows IMAX versions of popular-release movies as well as documentaries filmed for the format. A state-of-the-art 20-screen cinema. An old-fashioned carousel, which entertains children and their parents in the food court. An 80-acre nature preserve. The preserve features more than two miles of trails through a typical Georgia wetlands area. In addition to the summer concert and movie series, the Mall of Georgia hosts several annual events that have become traditions in Gwinnett County.  The Fourth of July fireworks display is one of the largest in Georgia, and it is accompanied by a day-long celebration with musical performances, carnival rides and prizes. The Kidgits Club offers breakfast with Santa and the Easter Bunny every year. An annual spring model and talent competition gives youngsters and adults alike a chance to strut their stuff.'' With its family-friendly mix of entertainment and shopping, the Mall of Georgia should continue to be a retail and tourist destination for many years."

Another recent visitor noted, Everything was over the top, artsy and classy.'' The service is generally highly praised, although some guests think they get overwhelmed when busy. Several comments mirror this one, saying the Mansion is a 5-star hotel with 2-star service.'' Most guests, however, have reacted like this person, who raved, This isn't just a hotel.

Craft Atlanta, from Top Chef'' Tom Colicchio, along with its sibling Craftbar, offers the city another incredible dining experience. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says that Colicchio is known for his fanatical dedication to fresh, thoughtfully sourced ingredients and the kind of simple, deft cooking that makes for memorable dishes and meals.'' Craft allows diners to choose among finely prepared meats and pair them with simply prepared vegetables. Craftbar is more casual (and cheaper) but just as delicious. Atlanta magazine raves, The Craftbar burger - with Tillamook cheddar nearly melted into the meat, a dab of tomato jam, and a couple threads of balsamic-infused onion - is a master class on a bun.'' The in-house restaurant, NEO, offers breakfast, lunch and dinner and serves contemporary American fare. The Mansion, at this writing, is the number-one rated hotel in Atlanta on the popular travel website tripadvisor.com. (These ratings change, but it is always in the top five.) The reviews are almost uniformly superb, saying this hotel is paradise'' and the best hotel in Atlanta.'' The service, dycor and facilities are all praised as some of the best that guests have ever encountered. One person, after describing several of the hotel's features, says, I could go on, but there was nothing lacking.'' The food, especially at Craft, is excellent, although several guests have mentioned that the service at NEO was a bit slow. Fodor's singles out the garden, saying, It's almost possible to forget you're in the middle of bustling Buckhead ... in the floral oasis, with benches and a shallow reflecting pool.''

Nearby attractions include the High Museum of Art, Atlanta Symphony Hall, the Alliance Theater, the Fox Theatre and the Atlanta Botanical Garden. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station about two blocks away, and a bus line serves the area. The building that houses the museum began life as a single-family home in 1899. In 1919, it was converted into a ten-unit apartment building. In 1925, Peggy,'' as she was known locally, and her husband John moved into the building, into an apartment she called the Dump.'' In 1978, the building was abandoned and was nearly demolished. Mayor Andrew Young designated the house as a city landmark in 1985 to prevent its demolition, and a group of preservationists came together to restore the building and create the museum. In 1994 and again in 1996, the apartment building suffered devastating fires, but both times, it was rebuilt through generous donations from the public and corporations. In 2004, the building's ownership was transferred to the Atlanta History Center, which maintains and operates it today. The Mitchell House and the History Center hope that the association will benefit them both; the Mitchell House draws more than 50,000 visitors a year, and the History Center gets about three times that many. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said, The union creates an institution that is expected to offer a revitalized focus on Southern culture, while enabling both facilities to reach bigger audiences, share costs and maximize fundraising.'' The former executive director of the History Center explained, `Part of what we're trying to do here is look from the Civil War to the civil rights era and beyond. This allows us to explore Southern history from the standpoint both of literature and historical evidence.''' The Margaret Mitchell House & Museum is more than a GWTW memorabilia collection, although it certainly has that, too. Its features include: The house tour. Mitchell's apartment is set up as she had it, with period furniture and some of her personal items. Two exhibits chronicle her life and the making of the movie. Collections and research. The Atlanta History Center holds most of Mitchell's personal writing, including correspondence and writing from her youth. The museum also has a collection of memorabilia from both the book and the movie. The Literary Center. The Literary Center is perhaps the most vibrant part of the museum. It sponsors lectures with authors like Alice Hoffman, Richard Russo and Marilynne Robinson; writing classes; a poetry recitation competition for high school students and summer writing camps and writing workshops for young people. Guided tours with a teacher's curriculum for school groups. Internet reviews of the house and museum are not very favorable. A few visitors love it, but many more agree with this person, who said, The museum is a little dull.'' Many reviewers complain about the price - 12 dollars - which they don't think is a good value. Most people think that only diehard GWTW fans will enjoy the museum, but even some fans are not impressed.'' In January of 2009, the Atlanta History Center laid off all of the Mitchell House employees but one. Perhaps the museum should start hoping that tomorrow is another day.''"
"The Marriott Marquis Atlanta: Atlanta's Soaring Architectural Gem","Georgia","The Marriott Marquis Atlanta: Atlanta's Soaring Architectural Gem","The Marriott Marquis Atlanta is located in downtown Atlanta in the heart of the hotel district. The hotel is easily accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is 15 minutes away, and most of Atlanta's downtown attractions are within walking distance or a short cab ride away, including the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, Philips Arena, the Georgia Dome and Centennial Olympic Park. There is inside access from the hotel to Atlanta's public rail system, MARTA. The Marriott Marquis Atlanta, completed in 1985, was designed by internationally famous Atlanta architect John Portman. Portman is known for creating the atrium hotel,'' and the Marriott's atrium, at 53 stories high, was the largest in the world at the time it was built. Portman designed a large part of Atlanta's downtown skyline; in addition to the Marriott, his buildings include the Westin Peachtree Plaza, the Hyatt Regency and Peachtree Center. The Marriott Marquis is Atlanta's largest hotel, featuring over 1,600 rooms and 94 suites. In 2008, the hotel completed a $140 million dollar, three-year renovation that updated guestrooms, added more suites, expanded the meeting space and completely redesigned all public areas. New features of the hotel include: The Atrium Ballroom, a 25,000-square-foot banquet space with floor-to-ceiling windows. Seven additional meeting rooms, bringing the total available meeting space to 160,000 square feet. Pulse, a new bar and lounge area that serves small plates and features an eye-catching five-story, acrylic sail that changes colors with the day's moods. Sear, the hotel's signature restaurant that offers fire-grilled steak and seafood. A new concierge lounge for preferred guests on the 42nd floor that is the largest concierge lounge in the Marriott chain. High Velocity, a sports bar that serves a large selection of beer and casual food and offers 21 plasma televisions and a 40-foot matrix projection screen television. The Spa, which provides full spa treatments as well as express, 25-minute services. J. W. Marriott Jr., chairman and CEO of Marriott International, says of the new look, We expect this renovation ... will push the Marriott envelope and help lead our brand to an entirely new level.''

Reviews of the renovated Marriott Marquis have been glowing, from both business and vacationing guests. The public areas are gorgeous, neat, clean and very modern,'' says one reviewer on a well-known travel site. The new renovation is amazing!'' raves another. One business traveler, whose regular, luxury hotels were booked, was delighted that the Marquis surpassed these hotels in service, accommodation and cuisine.'' Guests were also pleased with the downtown location, the stunning architecture and the professional service. Most negative reviews involved the prices of the rooms, parking and services. Overall, however, this guest's comment summed it up: This is one of the coolest hotels I have ever stayed at.''"
"The Marshall House Hotel: Savannah's Oldest Hotel Reborn","Georgia","The Marshall House Hotel: Savannah's Oldest Hotel Reborn","The Marshall House Hotel, the oldest operating hotel in Savannah, reopened in 1999 after being boarded up for 42 years. The hotel is located in the Historic District in downtown Savannah. Within walking distance are Riverfront Plaza, Factor's Walk, the Owens-Thomas House, the Jepson Center for the Arts and the City Market. The hotel can be reached from Interstate 16, which dead-ends into the Historic District. CAT, Savannah's public transit system, has a free downtown shuttle that stops near the hotel. The Marshall House has a long history of ups and downs. The hotel was built in 1851 by Mary Marshall, an enterprising businesswoman who saw the need for lodging in downtown Savannah and acted on it. The hotel is situated on Broughton Street, which at the time was the center of commerce in the city. During the last two years of the Civil War, after General Sherman made it to Savannah, the hotel was confiscated by the Union and used as a hospital. When Miss Mary died in 1877, the hotel gradually declined and finally closed in 1895. Several owners, renovations, openings and closings later, the hotel closed, seemingly for good, in 1957. By that time, Broughton Street was no longer in the central shopping district, and the area's decline seemed inevitable. The Savannah Morning News calls the Marshall House of the 1940s and `50s the kind of hotel frequented by salesmen, sailors and figures known more for their ability to down liquor than their place in high society.'' In 1998, however, in the midst of a revival for Broughton Street, the old hotel was bought and given a complete restoration. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted when the hotel reopened in 1999 that the famous wrought-iron railing along the second-floor veranda had been carefully recreated, and, Though rooms will be outfitted with modern amenities, they will have their original windows and pine floors. Some still have their 19th-century tubs.'' The hotel also retains its original staircases, fireplaces and even the doors to each guest room. Today, the hotel's 65 rooms and three suites are fitted with complimentary wired high-speed Internet access, wall-mounted flat-screen TVs, and luxurious bedding and bath amenities - in other words, all the trimmings of a modern-day luxury hotel. But the six Broughton Balcony rooms open onto the veranda, which has rocking chairs so guests can sit and watch Savannah pass by. Each room still has an 1851 fireplace, and the suites feature the original claw-foot tubs. Other hotel amenities include a 24-hour business center, wireless Internet access in public areas, a complimentary breakfast at 45 Bistro, the hotel's gourmet restaurant and complimentary membership at a nearby athletic club. The hotel is said to be haunted. A portrait of Mary Marshall hangs in the lobby, and one day a young girl told her father that she had seen that lady'' in the hallway. Guests have also seen the operating room were doctors treated Union soldiers brought from the battlefield. The ghosts don't seem to bother guests, however, who have rated the hotel the third-best in Savannah on the well-known travel website tripadvisor.com. It has been called the perfect place to stay'' with pure Southern charm.'' A couple from Wyoming were amazed by the Southern charm and hospitality we found at the Marshall House.'' Guests love the building and the dycor, as well as the location in the heart of the Historic District. The staff is singled out in almost every review as being incredibly friendly and helpful. The rare complaints mostly have to do with the quirks of an older building - creaky floors, rooms that are hard to keep cool and occasionally too much noise. This person perhaps sums up the experience of the Marshall House, saying, I cannot wait to go back to the Marshall House, it's like going home.''"
"The Mercer Williams House Museum: Savannah's Haunted Mansion from ``The Book''","Georgia","The Mercer Williams House Museum: Savannah's Haunted Mansion from ``The Book''","The Mercer Williams House Museum is the mansion featured in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. It is located in the southern part of Savannah's Historic District near Forsyth Park. The house is accessible from Interstate 16. The CAT shuttle, a free bus from Savannah's public transit system, goes through the district and stops near the house. It is within walking distance of most of the attractions in downtown Savannah. The Mercer Williams House was designed by John S. Norris, a prominent architect from New York. Norris designed many of Savannah's important mid-19th-century buildings, including the Savannah Custom House, the Andrew Low House and the Green-Meldrim House. The Mercer Williams House, one of his last commissions in the city, was designed in 1860, but, because of the Civil War, was not completed until 1869. According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, the house is a two-story brick Italianate-style dwelling with a classical entrance porch, decoratively sawn brackets along the eaves, and paired windows within segmental arches topped by heavy sculptural hoods.'' The house was built for Civil War General Hugh Mercer, the great-grandfather of legendary Savannah composer Johnny Mercer. In 1969, the house was bought by Savannah antiques dealer and house restorer Jim Williams. The house had stood vacant for more than ten years and was in poor condition. Williams, who restored more than 50 houses during his career in Savannah, took two years to bring the house into its showplace condition. He ran his antique restoration shop out of the carriage house in the back. In 1981, Danny Hanford, Williams' assistant, was murdered in the main house. Williams was accused of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. That conviction, however, was thrown out. Finally, Williams was found not guilty after his fourth trial. Sadly, six months later, Williams died of pneumonia. John Berendt, a New York journalist who was present in Savannah from Williams' second trial on, documented the proceedings and the local eccentrics surrounding them in his famous book. Today, the house is owned by Jim Williams' sister, Dorothy Kingery, who has opened the house up as a museum. In the house are Williams' fine art and furniture collections. The building itself is quite beautiful, a fine example of its period of architecture, but its main draw is its relation to the book,'' as the locals call it. The carriage house is now a gift shop that sells Midnight memorabilia and other Savannah items. The house is said to be haunted. Sometimes partygoers are heard on the anniversary of the night when Williams gave his most lavish annual party, only Mrs. Kingery no longer gives parties in the house. Two other people have died grisly deaths in the house, too, during its history, and it is always a stop on various Savannah ghost tours.'' Reviewers of the Mercer Williams House on a popular travel website gave the house mixed marks. Fans of the book'' were glad to be able to see where it all happened, although apparently guides have been instructed to talk as little about that as possible. One visitor said, If you've read the book, seen the movie and love architecture and art history, you'll enjoy the tour.'' Another fan said, It is sad to see that the house is in need of repair and cleaning.'' Several guests complained that the tour only shows four rooms and that those rooms are dirty and in bad shape. Indeed, one hopes that this most interesting of houses will continue to be cleaned and renovated and remade into the showplace that Jim Williams once called home."
"The Michael C. Carlos Museum: Atlanta's Hidden Gem of a Museum","Georgia","The Michael C. Carlos Museum: Atlanta's Hidden Gem of a Museum","The Michael C. Carlos Museum is devoted to the collection and study of art and artifacts from antiquity to the present, although they are best known for their antiquities. Located on the northeast side of Atlanta on the Emory University campus, the museum is near the Carter Center, the Fernbank Museum of Natural History and many of Atlanta's lovely and historical residential neighborhoods. The museum is about ten minutes from both the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and Interstate 285. The collection at the Carlos has its roots in the artifacts collected by Emory University since 1876, when the museum was known as the Emory College Museum and, later, the Emory University Museum. The collection was stored over the years in various locations around campus. Beginning in the 1980s, Atlanta businessman Michael C. Carlos began donating money to the university to make a permanent home for the museum. In 1993, an expansion turned the museum into one of Atlanta's top museum destinations. It was renamed for its major benefactor that year. The collection now contains over 18,000 items, including some of the finest antiquities in the country. Art & Antiques says, The Carlos is known as an institution with a reputation for quality and for connoisseurship.'' The New Georgia Encyclopedia believes that the Carlos Museum is emerging as the South's premier museum of ancient art.'' A 2005 renovation and expansion by the building's original architect, Michael Graves, made room for the museum's expanding collection of Greek and Roman art, which has attracted international attention for its superb quality. Other collections of the Carlos include: Egyptian, Nubian and Near Eastern Art. One of the most popular parts of the collection, this area contains items from the Nile valley from prehistoric times through the Roman era. The oldest Egyptian mummy in the Americas is here. Ancient American Art. Comprising more than 2,300 pieces, this collection includes art from the Maya, Aztec and Inca civilizations. African Art. This collection, primarily from the 19th and early 20th centuries, emphasizes art from West and Central Africa, although the East and Southern Africa collections are growing. Asian Art. The Asian Art collection features religious objects from South Asia, particularly India. Works on Paper. This collection contains over 4,000 prints, drawings and photographs from the Renaissance to the modern era of photography. The museum frequently stages special exhibitions from its collections. It also hosts traveling exhibitions, such as the recent Tutankhamen: The Golden King and the Great Pharoahs.'' The Carlos places a great emphasis on education. They produce programs, both on campus and through outreach. Adult programs include lecture and music series, while family programs feature art workshops, storytelling and special concerts for children. The Carlos welcomes school groups, but the Mummy Mobile'' will travel to you if you can't come to them. Teacher workshops help educators take lessons back to the classroom, and the museum has a growing online education program. Reviews on Internet travel websites of the Carlos Museum are glowing. Frommer's calls it intriguing;'' others say small but impressive,'' worth searching out,'' and among the best in the world.'' Among the few negative comments are complaints about the lack of parking on the Emory campus and the fact that the museum is small. Many visitors comment positively on the price, a suggested seven-dollar donation, and the fact that it is not that crowded even on weekends, except for when they have certain special exhibits.'' The museum is a hidden gem among Atlanta's headline attractions."

Many negative comments have to do with the price, especially since, as one person says, You don't see anything of real value.'' The one feature that seems to be universally popular is the tasting room - So many to taste, so little time!'' - and children like it more than adults. One commenter noted, The kids said it was their favorite thing we did.'' As for the new experience compared to the old, one Georgia couple who were frequent visitors to the old museum said, This is ten times better. There's no comparison.''"

The restaurant is accessible from Interstate 16, which dead-ends into the Historic District. Savannah's free downtown shuttle runs near the restaurant. Southern Living calls the Olde Pink House a Savannah culinary institution'' and the most Savannah-esque restaurant in town.'' The restaurant occupies a Georgian-style mansion built in 1771 by Joseph Habersham Jr., who lived in the house until his death in 1802. The mansion's old brick exterior is covered with a soft pink stucco, giving the house, and restaurant, its name. Mr. Habersham's ghost is said to inhabit the house; however, he only appears between October and March, perhaps to avoid the summer heat. The ghosts of slave children who died in a yellow fever epidemic have also been known to lock women into the basement ladies' room. One waitress cautions that, if you are downstairs and need the powder room, you are much better off going upstairs. The restaurant is a regular feature on Savannah's many ghost tours. Inside the restaurant, guests find high ceilings, period antiques and candlelit dining rooms. The Olde Pink House is a popular spot for a romantic evening, and many couples celebrate birthdays and anniversaries here. Downstairs is the Planters Tavern, the restaurant's first bar, which is a livelier space with loud conversations and live music. The Savannah Morning News says that, in the Tavern, the feeling of being in a grog house of old wraps itself around you like a warm blanket.'' A second bar, The Arches, has just been built adjacent to the house and has a more contemporary look and feel. The menu at the Olde Pink House is elegant American fare with an emphasis on seafood. The influence is Southern, specifically Low Country, with elements like grits, buttermilk, she-crab soup and sweet potatoes. Everything is given a gourmet spin, however. For instance, sides include two kinds of grits - mascarpone cheese grits and creamy stone ground grits - and sweet potatoes are served with pecan vanilla butter. Ravioli is stuffed with caramelized Vidalia onions and sweet potatoes, and the crispy fried lobster tails are served with bacon buttermilk whipped potatoes. The restaurant also serves lunch, and the two bars serve light fare. Reviewers generally cannot say enough good things about the Olde Pink House. It is the third-highest rated restaurant in the city on tripadvisor.com, a popular Internet travel review site. Typical comments include: A true gem!'' One of the best meals I've ever enjoyed.'' The staff was attentive, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere is elegant, but not snotty.'' The few negative comments tend to focus on the atmosphere, which some guests called stuffy;'' the service, which some found to be slow and inattentive; and the price, which some thought was too high for the quality of the food. However, the Olde Pink House remains one of the most popular restaurants in Savannah. Whether it is Mr. Habersham's ghost or the food and atmosphere that is luring visitors, this romantic old house is sure to be serving guests for a long time."

The Concorde Bar & Grill provides breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as specialty cocktails and fine wine. The restaurant serves a wide variety of American fare. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution points out that most of the Renaissance brands ... have single dining outlets. The Concourse's strategy is to emphasize quality, freshness and innovation - what patrons would expect from an upscale free-standing restaurant.'' The Renaissance Concourse has 35,000 square feet and a total of 28 rooms of meeting space, which were updated in 2007 along with the rest of the hotel. Franklin Smith, the director of sales and marketing for the hotel, was quoted in the Atlanta Business Chronicle as saying, It's really important to us to have more cutting-edge meeting space to match the rest of what we provide. We needed to bring the meeting space up to par.'' A new sound system was installed in the 11,000-square-foot Concourse Ballroom, which accommodates up to 1,500 guests reception-style or 770 banquet-style. A wide variety of other spaces is available, including several meeting rooms, a private dining room and a boardroom. Travelers are generally enthusiastic about the Renaissance Concourse on travel websites. On one site, 80 percent of reviewers gave the hotel an Excellent'' or Very Good'' rating, while only 11 percent gave it a Poor'' or Terrible.'' The location is its biggest asset, both in convenience to the airport and in the wow'' factor of watching the airplanes land literally right outside the window. Guests are impressed that there is little to no noise from the airport. The staff was singled out both as very willing'' and spotty'' in their helpfulness. Several reviewers mentioned that the hotel seems worn. The Professional Travel Guide says that the hotel's superior location, views and well-designed guest rooms make it more appealing. ... This is a pleasant surprise for an airport hotel.''"

The hotel has a large fitness center with an indoor pool and a full-service business center. The dining at the Ritz-Carlton cannot be matched anywhere in the city. The Cafy, the hotel's casual yet elegant all-day restaurant, offers breakfast, lunch and dinner in a relaxed setting. Casual'' at the Ritz means burgers made from American Wagyu beef and tarragon pesto pepperoni pizza. The Lobby Lounge, the hotel's bar area, serves an afternoon English tea and sophisticated cocktails, accompanied by live piano music and soft vocalists most evenings. The reason many Atlantans go to the Ritz-Carlton is to visit the Dining Room, one of only 16 Mobil Five Star restaurants in the United States. The Dining Room's reputation was built by legendary chef Guenter Seeger, who led the restaurant from 1985 to 1997. Since 2005, the Dining Room has been in the extraordinarily talented hands of Chef Arnaud Berthelier. When the chef came to the hotel, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution raved, [N]ever has the Dining Room been more dramatic ... has never felt this buoyant. ... It is a night for indulgence ... of theater and surprise ... passionate, impetuous - yet deliberate. ... [T]his scene will leave you breathless.'' Berthelier creates a new menu every night that features French cuisine with a healthy dose of other Mediterranean influences. His most popular offering is an eight-course, prix-fixe menu with wine pairings for each course. Internet reviews of the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead are mostly very positive, especially since the hotel's renovation. The staff is absolutely divine,'' says one recent guest, and another says the Dining Room has probably the best food I've ever tasted.'' The Professional Travel Guide notes, This property sparkles with impeccable maintenance.'' Some guests find it lacking, however, especially compared to newer luxury properties in the city. One says, A nice hotel ... but a Ritz-Carlton should never be just `okay' but always be `amazing.''' The Professional Travel Guide complements the staff on their friendliness, but says they need more training if they are ever going to reach the heights of another Five Diamond hotel's team.'' Nonetheless, the Ritz-Carlton is a top luxury option for a stay in Atlanta."

"The Telephone Museum: Atlanta's Connection to Our Communications Past","Georgia","The Telephone Museum: Atlanta's Connection to Our Communications Past","The Telephone Museum, one of Atlanta's lesser-known attractions, documents the first century of telephone usage in the United States. It is operated by the AT&T Pioneers, a volunteer organization of former BellSouth and AT&T workers. The museum is located in AT&T Midtown Center in the Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta. Nearby attractions include the Center for Puppetry Arts, the Varsity and the Fox Theatre. Atlanta's downtown attractions, including the Imagine It! Children's Museum and CNN Center, are only minutes away. The museum is easily accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station with a direct entrance from the building. The area is also served by local bus lines. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution says that the Telephone Museum isn't one of those eye-popping, thrill-a-minute destinations where you'd want to spend hours and hours,'' but it does recommend it for a day when school is closed and parents want an educational outing for the kids. Even for adults, especially history buffs, the museum offers a detailed look into the development and use of the telephone and its cultural impact over its first century. Guided tours are available with prior arrangement. Features of the museum include: A reproduction of Alexander Graham Bell's laboratory Many models of telephones, including wooden boxes going back to 1876 A life-sized 1920s street scene with a wax figure of a repairman working overhead A lighted display of fiber-optic strands, used to transmit voices and data A working exhibit of switching equipment that demonstrates how calls were once connected with each other by crossbars A 15-minute film on the telephone's development A display of the different types of transmission that have been used for voice and data, including cable, microwave and satellite A telephone receiver that visitors can talk on to hear the difference between analog and digital transmission There is a fascinating working display of the step-by-step'' dialing system, a series of relays, rods and wire brushes, that used pulses from the dialed numbers to connect each number one at a time. The system seems amazingly archaic when compared to today's digital system, which is also explained in detail. The museum also explores social issues that followed telephone technology. For example, as technology improved, operators lost their jobs, a situation that disproportionately affected the employment status of women. The museum is open from 11 AM to 1 PM Monday through Friday. A tour of the museum takes about an hour. Admission is free. Despite several interactive exhibits, much of the museum's information is garnered through reading. As the Journal-Constitution says, Younger children might get antsy unless someone explains it to them at a level they can understand,'' although they note that one four-year-old seemed to be having fun just running around pushing buttons.'' The Telephone Museum is definitely more educational than it is fun, but inquisitive young people who cannot imagine life without a cell phone attached to them 24 hours a day will find these exhibits interesting. One young man who toured the museum declared it neat to look at'' and kind of cool.'' A twelve-year-old proclaimed that you can learn a lot from this place,'' a ringing (no pun intended) endorsement from someone his age!"
"The Village at Riverwatch: Augusta's First Regional Shopping Center","Georgia","The Village at Riverwatch: Augusta's First Regional Shopping Center","The Village at Riverwatch, a new shopping center in Augusta, Georgia, is the area's first truly regional shopping destination. It is located along Interstate 20 and Riverwatch Parkway, near the banks of the Savannah River and the historic Augusta Canal. Augusta is known throughout the world as the home of the Master's golf tournament, held every April, but it is also a city with an extraordinary history, with beautiful and architecturally significant homes and commercial buildings. Columbia County, the primary county in the metro area, is one of the fastest growing counties in the state of Georgia. The primary trade area for the Village at Riverwatch extends over several counties in Georgia and South Carolina and includes nearly half-a-million people. The 800,000-square-foot development is designed in an open-air, streetscape'' style instead of an enclosed mall. This retail style, known to real estate developers as a lifestyle center,'' is meant to emulate a village in which shoppers walk from store to store. The center includes a Bass Pro Shop, Belk department store and Costco warehouse retailer, as well as an 18-screen cinema. The new Belk department store will replace an older one at another shopping center, nearly tripling the older store's size. The cinema, operated by Starplex, is that company's first location in Georgia. The Bass Pro Shop, according to the company's website, is a visually appealing mixture of sporting goods store, aquarium, outdoor education center, conservatory and entertainment. The stores are frequently tourist attractions in their own right. Martin McDonald, the director of corporate public relations for the company says, These stores are regional draws. People drive an average of 50 miles to one of these stores.'' Each store is designed to reflect the sporting and outdoor heritage of the local area. The new Augusta location will be no different, emphasizing hunting, fishing and golf. A major concern surrounding the construction of the Village at Riverwatch has been its effect on the historic Augusta Canal. The canal, constructed in 1845, was one of the only successful industrial canals in the South. It spurred the development of factories and mills in Augusta, leading to the town's success as a manufacturing center. Now a National Heritage Area, the canal runs alongside the site of the Village at Riverwatch. The owners of the project have donated over 18 acres of land, as well as $250,000, to the Augusta Canal Authority, to serve as a buffer between the canal and the retail center, and local environmentalists and historians are hopeful that the development will help, rather than hinder, respectful recreational use of the area. The developer and local authorities alike hope to connect the site with other areas through bicycle trails and a proposed canoe and kayak dock. Stores at the Village at Riverwatch are currently scheduled to begin opening in the Fall of 2009. The project will eventually include casual restaurants, small specialty shops and another large anchor. The Bass Pro Shop is expected to be the first major retailer to open on the site."
"The Virginia Highland Neighborhood: One of Atlanta's Most Charming Historic Areas","Georgia","The Virginia Highland Neighborhood: One of Atlanta's Most Charming Historic Areas","Virginia Highland is a historic neighborhood in the midtown area of Atlanta, five minutes northeast of downtown Atlanta. It is easily accessible from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector and is served by several bus routes. Virginia Highland is home to charming, vintage houses, elegant and unique shops and some of Atlanta's finest restaurants and bars. The neighborhood's name comes from the fact that it is centered around the intersection of Virginia and Highland Avenues. The Virginia Highland area was once filled with farms that sat on the outskirts of Atlanta. In the first years of the 20th century, trolley lines were laid from downtown Atlanta to the suburbs,'' which quickly developed into residential and commercial neighborhoods. Around each trolley stop, a small group of commercial establishments would be built. Fanning out from these would be residential streets. This pattern now gives Virginia Highland its pedestrian-oriented, village'' atmosphere. Between 1908 and the mid-1920s, Virginia Highland filled in with homes, many of them built in the Craftsman bungalow style for which the neighborhood is famous. Virginia Highland is one of Atlanta's prime destinations for shopping and eating. Among its varied restaurants and bars are: La Tavola Trattoria - Consistently voted one of Atlanta's best restaurants, La Tavola Trattoria offers upscale, fine Italian cuisine. Cafy di Sol - Cafy di Sol is a casual eatery featuring small plates and entrees of mostly Mediterranean influence. Blind Willie's - Blind Willie's is one of the premier blues bars in Atlanta, with live blues every night except Sundays and featuring both local and nationally known acts. Moe's and Joe's - An Atlanta institution,'' Moe's and Joe's is a hole-in-the-wall dive that has delighted Atlantans with cheap beer and hot dogs since 1947. Noche - Noche, overseen by one of Atlanta's top chefs, is a Spanish-style tapas bar that is also known for its fabulous margaritas. The shopping in Virginia Highland is world class. Highlights include Bella Cucina Artful Food, a boutique offering Italian homemade food gifts; the Gems of Africa Gallery, featuring African jewelry, clothing and art; Mitzi & Romano, a designer women's clothing store; and Ten Thousand Villages, an internationally known store which offers fair-trade crafts from around the world. The area is filled with many other shopping venues, including antique stores, men's and women's clothing and original art galleries. Every June, Virginia Highland celebrates Summerfest. Summerfest is a street festival that offers up food from neighborhood restaurants and live musical performances. There is also a 5K run and Kidsfest, an area of the festival just for children. The most notable part of the festival, however, is the artist's market, featuring over 200 artists from all over the Southeast. Virginia Highland is one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Atlanta. Its homes are sought after, and its shopping and dining have made it a tourist destination. Because of this, the area is unfortunately plagued by traffic and parking issues. Many residents complain that they cannot get in and out of their own driveways on weekends. Nonetheless, this area of Atlanta is expected to continue to thrive as a prime example of in-town living for years to come."

W services include Recess, special experiences designed to give long meetings an entertaining break, and Sensory Set Up, which provides music, aromatherapy, candles, games or other creative touches during meetings. Internet reviews of the W Downtown are mixed; they vary greatly according to the age of the guest. Younger visitors looking for fun love the hotel. One woman exclaims, The staff is super friendly. ... The environment is warm and ... full of great convo. And the layout and dycor ... O lawd. Fabulous.'' Older, more sedate business travelers are more skeptical. Everyone agrees the hotel is very stylish, but the noise and raucous parties are too much for some. One calls it the Four Seasons ... for 22-year-olds.'' Almost everyone appreciates the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. The conclusion seems to be that if you are young and hip and like to party, the W Downtown is the place for you. If you prefer a quieter, more business-like atmosphere, you may want to find somewhere else."

It was the tallest hotel in the world when it was built, and it remains the second tallest hotel in the Western Hemisphere. The top level of the building is an observation deck, and the two levels beneath it are the hotel's famous revolving Sun Dial Bar and Restaurant. The Professional Travel Guide calls the hotel a stunning tour de force of 1970s hotel architecture.''

"The William Oliver Building: Atlanta's Classic of Art Deco Architecture","Georgia","The William Oliver Building: Atlanta's Classic of Art Deco Architecture","The William Oliver Building, Atlanta's first and most detailed Art Deco skyscraper, is located in downtown Atlanta on the famous Peachtree Street at Five Points, the original center of Atlanta commerce. It is located on the edge of the Fairlie Poplar Historic District, the oldest remaining part of Atlanta's central business district. The building was named for the grandsons, William and Oliver, of Atlanta real estate developer Thomas G. Healey. Nearby attractions include the Georgia State Capitol, Oakland Cemetery, Turner Field, the Georgia Dome, CNN Center and the Georgia Aquarium. The building can be reached from the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector. MARTA, Atlanta's public transit system, has a train station at Five Points. In addition, several bus routes serve the area. Built in 1930, the 16-story William Oliver Building was the first large building in Atlanta to be built completely in the Art Deco style. The architects, Pringle and Smith, had worked in Atlanta throughout the 1920s, primarily in the Beaux Arts style. Robert Michael Craig, author of Atlanta Architecture: Art Deco to Modern Classic, 1929-1959, explains, Art Deco's popular appeal was a product of its self-evident display of the art, rather than the science, of building. Deco was an art of sensual colorism, of decorative patterns, and of references to traditional ornamental forms.''  Deco details on the building's exterior include the zigzag frieze ... interlaced among floral patterns,'' and a jazzy syncopation of chevrons,'' according to Craig. The main doorway, on Peachtree Street, is decorated in bronze with a filigreed, repeating pattern. The author notes that Pringle and Smith were soon the city's premier Art Deco architects. The William Oliver was completely renovated in 1996 as apartments for the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. In 2002, the 114 units were converted to condominiums. The building still has its brass elevator doors and marble and terrazzo floors,'' according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. However, upgrades like high-speed Internet service have been added, as well as security measures and a 24-hour-a-day concierge staff. The building features a rooftop terrace with views of the Atlanta skyline. It also has a clubroom, fitness center and business center. The units range in size from a 465-square-foot studio to a 1310-square-foot penthouse. Most units are in the 600- to 900-square-foot range. The building also contains 5,000 square feet of retail and cafy space. The best reviewers of the William Oliver Building are the ones who live there. One resident said in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The building is so beautiful and has so much character. ... There's a lot of vibrancy in Atlanta now. ... I see it as an adventure. Residents enjoy the amenities of the building, especially the rooftop terrace and the concierge, luxuries that are rare in downtown Atlanta. One person raves, The view from the roof is absolute AMAZING.'' Even so, many students are able to afford the condos. One student at Georgia State University, right around the corner, says it's great to roll out of bed and walk to class.'' Some mention the hassle of panhandlers, but one young woman says, I never feel unsafe.'' The William Oliver is a successful example of the city of Atlanta's ongoing efforts to revitalize their historic downtown."

This latest renovation was primarily cosmetic and included new interior and exterior signage, paint, carpet and tile, lighting and seating. The food court was also completely remodeled, and a children's play area was added. The mall renovation has inspired several existing tenants to remodel or upgrade their own spaces, and it has attracted some new, more upscale stores to Town Center, including Coach, Charlotte Russe, Swarovski Crystal and H&M, a higher-end Swedish retailer. JCPenney, which has occupied the mall since 1997 when it replaced Mervyn's, is also completing its first major renovation.

"Tree That Owns Itself","Georgia","Tree That Owns Itself","The Tree That Owns Itself is a white oak tree located at the corner of South Finley and Dearing Streets in Athens, Georgia. The story of the tree is thought to go back to around 1832 when it was deeded ownership of itself and the land around it by Colonel William Henry Jackson. The tree was located on the colonel's property and he supposedly held fond childhood memories of it.  The tree that currently exists is actually not the original as this fell back in 1942 due to poor condition, but from its acorns the existing tree was grown. The original is thought to have dated back to somewhere between the mid 16th and 18th centuries. The new tree, which is often referred to as the Son of the Tree That Owns Itself, was dedicated in a formal ceremony in 1946. Although the tree sits alongside private homes in a residential neighborhood, it is open to the public and regularly attracts visitors.

"Tybee Island: Savannah's Historic Beach","Georgia","Tybee Island: Savannah's Historic Beach","Tybee Island is the northernmost of Georgia's barrier islands, the small islands that run along the Georgia coast. The island sits at the mouth of the Savannah River, about 18 miles east of the city of Savannah. It is not quite three miles long and has white sand beaches facing the Atlantic for most of its length. Tybee's written history goes back to its colonization and conversion of the Native Americans by the Spanish beginning in 1520. The Spanish and the French fought an early naval battle off the shore, the first of many military skirmishes the island would see. General James Oglethorpe established a camp at Tybee in 1732 before he founded the city of Savannah. In 1736, he constructed a small fort and lighthouse on the island to protect the mouth of the river. During the American Revolution, American and French forces used the island as a staging area to prepare to fight the British, who held Savannah. During the Civil War, Union troops occupied the island and fired on the Confederate stronghold at Fort Pulaski, destroying their mortar battlements and taking the fort. After the Civil War, Fort Screven was built on the northern end of the island, serving as part of the nation's coastal defense system. Fort Screven was closed in 1947 and is now the Tybee Museum. In addition to its military and strategic history, Tybee Island has a long history as a beach resort. At the end of the 19th century, the island became known as a place a place to take the salts,'' or spend time in the fresh sea air as a cure for respiratory and other illnesses. By the mid-1890s, a railroad line brought vacationers and day-trippers to the island. The railroad built a pavilion at the end of a pier out over the water that became famous for its dancing and big bands. The pavilion stood until 1967, when it was destroyed by fire. In its heyday, Tybee had several large resort hotels, all of which are now gone. By far the most famous landmark that remains on the island today is the lighthouse. Originally constructed under the orders of General Oglethorpe in 1736, the lighthouse is still operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, although the site itself is maintained by the Tybee Island Historical Society. The current building is the fourth one that has stood on the site and was constructed in 1916. It is the only lighthouse on the Eastern Seaboard that still has all of its original buildings, including a restored keeper's cottage. The lighthouse still houses its rare, first-order Fresnel lens, one of only 15 in the United States still in use. Today, Tybee is still a desirable location for a beach vacation, although it has lost its early-20th-century glamour. As a report from Frommer's Travel Guide put it, Tybee feels kind of like Atlantic City meets Coney Island - a little shabby, but that shabbiness often translates to a retro charm.'' Health magazine named Tybee its number one Healthiest Beach and Lake Getaway'' in the summer of 2009 for its clean beaches and water, its tasty and (mostly) healthy food and its active lifestyle. The island has several hotels and about 300 homes for rent, many of them charming beach cottages from the 1940s and '50s. The pavilion has been rebuilt and hosts several festivals every year. One of the most popular annual events is the Beach Bums Parade, in which spectators and parade participants have water fights. Health magazine says, Tybee offers something for everyone.'' Indeed, the island has history, nature, beautiful beaches, good food and family fun. Most reviewers on a popular travel website love the island's quiet, slow, Southern-town-on-the-beach feel. Those looking for a full-blown resort were disappointed, but this reviewer summed it up: After years in the chi-chi beaches of southern California, I loved Tybee. It's low-key, not pretentious, full of families and local flavor.''"

The 11-story Orr Doctors' Building was constructed after a fire destroyed an old apartment building on the same site that had been converted to medical offices. Many patients' records and valuable equipment were lost. The owners of the building immediately commissioned a new building, one that would be designed specifically with the needs of doctors and dentists in mind. Moreover, they required that the building be fireproof. The well-known Atlanta architectural firm Pringle & Smith was hired to design the new building. Robert Pringle and Francis Smith had been working together in Atlanta since the early 1920s and had already created several landmark buildings in the city, including the Cox-Carlton Hotel, the Norris Building and the Rhodes-Haverty Building. The Orr Building uses reinforced concrete and a steel service core, which, according to the Atlanta Urban Design Commission (AUDC), were significant technological innovations in high-rise construction of the era.'' Until 1930, their work had been in the more traditional Beaux Arts style, but that year two of their designs, the Orr Building and the William-Oliver Building, took on elements of the Art Deco movement. Robert Michael Craig, author of Atlanta Architecture: Art Deco to Modern Classic, 1929-1959, points out that the subtlety of the building's Deco ornamentation reflects its nature as a structure both dedicated in its use to science and built using the latest engineering. Craig notes that the decoration is not the brightly colored, glazed terra-cotta patterns of traditionally picturesque Deco, but the abstraction of machine-cut, incised patterns defined by light and shadow, not color.'' The Orr Building is also significant because it represented a shift away from downtown Atlanta, even as early as 1930. The AUDC points out that the use of the automobile, as well as the desire for modern amenities, began to push newer buildings to the north. Such buildings offered amenities not typical in the older downtown area, such as modern mechanical systems, easy access by car, and adjacent garage parking.'' This period marked the beginning of the transformation of Peachtree Street from a residential avenue lined with mansions to the commercial corridor that it remains today. The most important feature of the Orr Building, however, is that it has never stopped being used for the purpose for which it was built. It is owned today by Emory Crawford Long Hospital and still houses hospital facilities and doctors' offices. The building was designated by the City of Atlanta as a Landmark Building in 1989, in part for this reason. The AUDC explains that the eleven-story, cream-colored brick building expresses its original character with uncanny intensity, particularly in its lavish lobby, and in part because it has been maintained and utilized for its original purpose without interruption over the years.'' According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the hospital wanted to demolish the building in the late 1990s, but its protected status would have made that difficult. Instead, they decided to continue to use the historic building as it was meant to be used, a decision that would have made its builders proud."

"Warm Springs Regional Fisheries Center","Georgia","Warm Springs Regional Fisheries Center","Warm Springs Regional Fisheries Center was opened in 1990 as Warm Springs, Georgia's southeast regional fishery. There is a program that incorporates the Fish Health Center and two National Fish Hatcheries. There is also a Fish Technology Center as a part of the entire single complex. The center was designed to grow fish for restaurants to help stop the over fishing of the oceans. It is also a research center that looks at fish diseases and fish health in order to ensure that people are eating healthy fish and not something that could potentially harm human health. The Fish Health Center was actually opened one year prior to the entire complex.  The Fish Technology Center helps to improve management of fish and supports regional fish operations. The center helps private aquaculture industries too. The Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery was established by Congress in 1898 and opened in 1899.

The resort is near all of the Historic District's attractions, including Riverfront Plaza, Factor's Walk, the Jepson Center for the Arts and the city's many historic homes and churches. The Westin can be reached from Interstate 16 via U.S. Highway 17 across the Talmadge Bridge or from Riverfront Plaza via a free ferry across the river. The 403-room hotel opened in late 1999 to great fanfare in Savannah. According to the Savannah Morning News, the hotel had booked $16 million in sales and more than 200 meetings before it ever opened. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted, Savannahians may love their city's cobblestone streets ... gardens and ... squares, but they are not immune to a Stylish New Thing. Especially when it's as pretty as the Westin.'' A complete renovation of the property, including rooms, public spaces and meeting rooms, was completed in early 2009, updating the resort's dycor, amenities and technological services. The Westin's rooms are 300 square feet; a few suites are available, most around 600 square feet. The upgraded amenities include in-room video games, a 42-inch flat-screen television, Westin's signature Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Bath, wired and wireless high-speed Internet access and a work area. Most suites feature an additional seating area and bath, and all suites have balconies. The hotel's other amenities include a fitness center with group classes, an outdoor heated pool with cabanas and a deepwater dock. Dining options at the resort are the Midnight Sun Lounge, a casual bar with cocktails, light fare and cigars; the Club Grille, also offering light fare with an emphasis on healthier food; and Aqua Star, the upscale but resort-casual signature restaurant, which specializes in Low Country cuisine with a modern touch. The Westin's prize facility is its 18-hole PGA Championship golf course, designed in part by Sam Snead and managed by Troon Golf. The course has been named one of the Top 60 Golf Resorts in the United States by Condy Nast Traveler and a Four-Star Highly Recommended Places to Play by Golf Digest. The course hosts the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf tournament every year. The 22,000-square-foot clubhouse has a pro shop, lockers, dining and a meeting space. The clubhouse is also home to the Greenbrier Spa at Savannah Harbor, the only Greenbrier facility located outside the legendary resort in West Virginia. The luxurious spa offers a full line of treatments, including baths and soaks, body peels and wraps with seasonal fruits, manicures and pedicures, and a large menu of massage and facial treatments. The resort is adjacent to the Savannah International Trade & Convention Center, which has over 250,000 square feet of meeting space. The hotel has 35,000 square feet of its own, however, including an 11,000-square-foot Grand Ballroom that accommodates 840 banquet-style or 1,600 reception-style; lawn, deck and pavilion areas that are perfect for weddings; and conference rooms of varying size. An onsite audiovisual service company provides up-to-date equipment of any sort. Banquet and catering services are available through the resort. Reviews of the Westin Savannah are average to good. Many guests on Internet review sites complain that the resort is overpriced for the value - It is not 5-star as some ... claim,'' says one recent visitor. Others cite poor customer service and the inconvenience of getting to the island. The resort has its share of great reviews, too. The staff was very friendly and always had a smile,'' says one guest. Others love the amenities - The BED!! OHHHH, the BED!'' raves one. The Professional Travel Guide gives the resort five stars (of five) based on the amenities. Frommer's, on the other hand, gives it one (of three), disliking its remove from the rest of the city. The bottom line seems to be that if you like a corporate business hotel with great add-ons, you will love the Westin. If you are looking for the idiosyncratic charm of a 200-year-old bed and breakfast, you will be better off staying elsewhere."

"Wormsloe Historic Site: Savannah's Original Plantation","Georgia","Wormsloe Historic Site: Savannah's Original Plantation","The Wormsloe Historic Site, the oldest remains in Savannah from the time of the city's founding, is located about ten miles south of Savannah's Historic District. Besides the Historic District, other attractions in the area include Tybee Island, Fort Pulaski, Old Fort Jackson and Skidaway Island State Park. The site can be reached by taking the Harry S Truman Parkway south from downtown Savannah. The approach to the site is one of its most famous features - an avenue lined with more than 400 live oaks, dripping with Spanish moss, that arch over the roadway. Wormsloe is an estate founded on land given to Noble Jones, who was one of the original settlers of Georgia, along with General James Oglethorpe, in 1733. Jones was a carpenter and physician on whom Oglethorpe relied for many tasks. The land was to be a working plantation, but also intended as a fortification against the Spanish, who were expected to attack from south of the city. At one time, a garrison of 53 marines was stationed at Wormsloe and engaged in the Battle of Bloody Marsh in 1742. According to the Savannah Morning News, That small but significant engagement marked the last attempt by the Spanish to overrun Savannah and the rest of Georgia.'' The original compound at Wormsloe was made of tabby, a mixture of oyster shells with other materials that hardens into a concrete-like substance. Ruins of this fortified tabby residence are all that is left of the original dwelling. The descendants of Noble Jones live in a home nearby that was built in 1828, but this home is not part of the historic site. In addition to the tabby ruins, the Wormsloe Historic Site has several interpretive features: A museum tells the story of the Jones family at Wormsloe and includes many archaeological artifacts found on the property, as well as a short film. A nature trail highlights some the native marsh ecology as well as invasive species that were brought to the area by Europeans. A living history program that has reconstructed buildings typical of the colonial period, as well as re-enactors who demonstrate early Georgia skills and crafts such as spinning, woodworking and cooking. The Wormsloe Historic Site hosts several annual events that give visitors a look at colonial life in Georgia. These include: The Colonial Faire and Muster, held in February, which recreates everyday life as the colonists might have lived it. Games, dancing and music, cooking, crafts and military displays are all part of this popular event. The War of Jenkin's Ear, held every May, which focuses on Georgia's military operations during this little known war between England and Spain. Musket firing, cartridge making and military drills are all a part of this re-enactment. Colonial Christmas at Wormsloe, which features holiday activities from colonial Georgia, including the burning of the yule log, games and refreshments. Reviews of the Wormsloe Historic Site on Internet travel sites are mixed. Everyone agrees with this person, who said, The long road lined with oak trees is reason enough to visit this site.'' The nature trail is also popular for its physical beauty. For the history, some loved it. One visitor said, This was a worthy break from the Savannah action.'' Another person, however, notes, I was disappointed that there wasn't much information regarding life on the plantation. ... The historical substance is a bit lacking.'' The consensus seems to be that this a peaceful, beautiful spot if you enjoy nature, but you need to be a true history buff if you come for that."

The house was named after wrens made a nest in the mailbox 120 years ago. If you visit in the spring, you might see that wrens still make nests in the mailbox. The museum officially opened as a house museum in 1913, with financial support from Andrew Carnegie, President Theodore Roosevelt, and the fundraising efforts of kids from Atlanta Public Schools. Joel Chandler Harris recreated the oral tradition of the Brer Rabbit tales in print between 1876 and 1908.  The success of the Uncle Remus stories made Harris one of the most popular American writers in the 19th and 20th centuries. His first collection, Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings, has been translated into more than 40 languages and has never gone out of print. Harris collected 194 stories that gave voice to African-American folklore and jumpstarted the folklore movement throughout the world."
"Wright Square","Georgia","Wright Square","Wright Square was named Percival Square after Lord Percival when it was first constructed in Savannah, Georgia. The square was renamed in 1763 to Wright Square in honor of James Wright. He was the third royal governor of Georgia. It is said that he was the most notable. The square was also known as Court House Square and Post Office Square. It is located near the present Tomochichi Federal Building and US Courthouse. The courthouse is on the west side of the square.  The square is best known as the burial site of Tomochichi. He was the leader of Creek Nation Native Americans. He was trusted by James Oglethorpe and helped Oglethorpe set up his colony. When the Native American died in 1739 Oglethorpe ordered that he be buried with military honors in Percival Square. The customs of his people were seen to with the grave by marking it with a pyramid of stones. Unfortunately, in 1883 citizens replaced the pyramid of stones with the William Washington Gordon monument. It is an allegorical monument to the man. Gordon's widow actually objected to the monument since it would insult Tomochichi, so she along with others worked to create a granite monument for Tomochichi."

"Zoo Atlanta","Georgia","Zoo Atlanta - Atlanta, Georgia - midsize city zoo covering 40 acres","Founded in 1889, Zoo Atlanta is a testament to the humanitarian action of one man. In 1889, a traveling circus heading for Marietta, Georgia ran into money trouble and ended up stranded in Atlanta. Abandoned in their cages, the animals began to attract the attention of the curious. Two weeks after the owner of the menagerie declared bankruptcy, local lumber magnate purchased the animals and their cages at auction, then donated the entire parcel to the city of Atlanta. The animals were relocated and given a new home at Grant Park, and the zoo opened to wide enthusiasm. The original stock of the zoo included jaguars, lionesses, pumas, black bears, hyenas, camels, snakes, and more. In the 1930s, the Atlanta Zoo at Grant Park got a major boost to its collection when a wealthy city resident, Asa G. Candler, Jr., found himself in a bit of a pickle with the city. He had collected an extensive menagerie which he kept on his estate, much to the chagrin of his neighbors, who objected to the inevitable smells and noises emanating from his estate. He solved his problem by offering the collection of animals to the city on the condition that the city of Atlanta raise the funds required to house and maintain the animals properly. The city launched a successful fund-raising drive, and in 1935, the Grant Park Zoo nearly doubled its population when it added elephants, leopards, water buffalo, elk, zebra, birds, a hyena and a sea lion, and a tiger to its permanent collection. Over the next fifty years, the zoo tried to keep up with trends in animal housing and zoo technology, but the concrete cages and iron bars of the older facility were becoming rapidly outdated. Despite attempts to raise funds and update the facilities, by the 1970s, the zoo had fallen into disrepair. Perhaps the lowest point of the zoo's history came in 1983, when Parade Magazine named the Atlanta Zoo one of the ten worst zoos in the country. Amid public outcry, the zoo lost its accreditation and the city convened a crisis team to set a new direction for the zoo. In 1985, the zoo was privatized and a new governing council emerged with a new, young name - Zoo Atlanta - and fresh plan for redevelopment. Over the next several years, the new Zoo undertook renovations and projects, including reducing the population at the zoo and new naturalistic exhibits for the animals. Today, Zoo Atlanta has emerged from its past as a Victorian curiosity shop to become a world class zoo, fully accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, pursuing its mission to educate young people and raise awareness of the natural world. The zoo is open year round, except Christmas and Thanksgiving; hours are from 9:30-5:30 Monday through Friday, 9:30-6:30 Saturday and Sunday. Adult admission is $18.99, and children 3-11 cost $13.99. Discounts are available for groups, and special rates apply for senior citizens, military and college students. More details on hours and admissions at Zoo Atlanta by calling 404-624-WILD."
