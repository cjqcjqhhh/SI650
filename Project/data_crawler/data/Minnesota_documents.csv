"Aerial Lift Bridge","Minnesota","Aerial Lift Bridge, Duluth, MN","Duluth, Minnesota is a port city for Lake Superior. The lake has been a part of the industrial growth of the state of Minnesota especially dating back to earlier centuries. One of the most important landmarks of Duluth is the Aerial Lift Bridge. The bridge provides a vertical lift, which is quite uncommon for most bridges. At first the bridge was created for a transporter. It was the first of two vertical lift bridges created in the United States. What is historically significant about the bridge is its age. It was constructed in 1905, and upgraded in 1929 to the lift design it has today. By 1973 Americans realized how important the bridge was, inducting it into the National Register of Historic Places. The city of Duluth maintains and runs the bridge. The lake contains a few different sections that are narrow. Just off of the lake is the canal that the bridge spans. Underneath the bridge is a sand bar named Minnesota Point. Lake Superior and the St. Louis River are two waterways near Duluth. It is actually a canal off the river which holds the bridge where the river is about seven miles from the bridge to the southeast. Since the townspeople decided to break up the sandbar it became necessary for those living on the island to be able to access the city. Many transportation methods were tried, but very few of them actually worked. A ferry could work during the summer, but the winter months made it impossible. A swinging footbridge was used for a few years, but again it was considered an unworthy resort because of the rickety and unsafe nature. By 1892 the best solution was provided. Still, it took many years after that before the Aerial Lift Bridge could be completed. The War Department was one of the biggest departments to be against the bridge. The architect in charge of the project was not going to be turned down though. He decided to take his design to Chicago where the bridge was built the way he wanted it. Since the plans were used in that city, many began seeking other designs that could do a similar thing. They felt what was really needed was some type of aerial transport ferry, which is how the bridge came into fruition. When the bridge was completed it had a capacity of 60 short tons. It was able to carry 350 people, wagons, streetcars, or automobiles across the canal. The trip took about one minute where as the car ferry took five minutes. The growing population of Duluth created a demand for more trips on the bridge and tourism soon picked up. It was one of the reasons for the necessary reconfiguration in the 20's. Since the bridge was being used at capacity they had to reformulate it to withstand the many uses it was seeing. Visitors today can take a trip down to the shoreline in order to see the bridge and even watch how it works."

"Bob Dylan Way","Minnesota","Bob Dylan Way, Duluth, MN","Duluth, Minnesota was the native town for Bob Dylan. In honor of the musician Duluth created Bob Dylan Way in May 2006. It was a commemorative move to celebrate the performer's 65th birthday. Citizens of Duluth raised private funds to install 30 street signs in Duluth. These signs point the Bob Dylan Pathway which extends 1.8 miles through the downtown section of Duluth. The pathway begins on Michigan Street at 5th Avenue West and runs to 15th Avenue and London Road. These roads are part of Lester Park neighborhood and other significant downtown tourist locations. Tourists who wish to spend their time following the pathway can drive or walk the 1.8 miles. The streets are fairly easy to navigate though London Road is one of the main roads of the area. Michigan Street and Superior Street are also main thoroughfares for the downtown area. Bob Dylan Way will link the cultural and historically significant areas of downtown for the tourists. For example the Depot and the historic Armory are on the pathway for visitors to enjoy during their walk. An exhibit based on Bob Dylan is found along the pathway at Fitgers on Superior Street. The performer, Bob Dylan was born in Duluth in 1941. However, his family didn't stay in Duluth for long. Instead in 1947 he and his family moved to Hibbing. Though his stay in Duluth was short, the city certainly remembers his strong ties to the community. They also wish to celebrate his honesty, artistic freedom and more. It is just one way Duluth celebrates the artists that have been born or spent time in their city. Many local artists and their art are always mentioned and celebrated in Duluth. The pathway is just one way that Duluth remembers Bob Dylan and his short time in the area. They have an annual birthday celebration which takes place at Fitgers. The celebration is always held on his birthday. Fitgers is a brewhouse where the celebration starts at 7pm with music from the artist as well as other important singer/songwriters. They also have contests for other would be stars. The Bob Dylan Way Committee offers music for Grandma's Marathon. The marathon is another annual event in the downtown section of Duluth. Each year runners will sign up to end up at Grandma's Restaurant for a celebration. It is here that the music is played. Mentioned above was an exhibit at Fitgers about Bob Dylan. The exhibit shows some of the songs, memorabilia, and other aspects of Bob Dylan's life for visitors. It is possible to have lunch or dinner while viewing the exhibit to make it a true experience. The Bob Dylan Way can be commemorated with buttons which are available at 21 West Superior Street and the Electric Fetus at 12 East Superior Street. The buttons are $5.

"Casino Gaming by Lake Superior","Minnesota","Casino Gaming by Lake Superior","For a relatively small town compared to other attraction heavy cities, Duluth has quite a bit to offer tourists as well as residents. One side trip worth considering is the Fond-du-luth Casino located downtown. Fond-du-luth Casino doesn't claim to be another Las Vegas strip gambling hotspot, but it does offer the gaming enthusiast a nice respite from touring the many other Lake Superior attractions Duluth has to offer. The casino is owned and operated by the Lake Superior Chippewa, Fond du Lac Band. From the exterior the building hardly gives the appearance of a location one would find gambling opportunities. Once inside, however, visitors will be surprised at the number of slots available, over 750 to be exact. Fans of Blackjack will be thrilled at the availability of the 4 card gaming tables. The environment is friendly and gives guests a comfortable feeling as they wonder around this small but modern gaming facility. The friendly staff offers beverages while gaming, although unlike some of the larger casinos there is a small charge. The casino has ATM service and also a check cashing facility. The casino just recently implemented a cash access program that enables cardholders the ability to cash checks here as well as numerous gaming businesses around the country. It is anticipated that this service will remove the hassle for visitors seeking check cashing capability. The casino claims the process of obtaining a card only takes seconds enabling the gamer to be back in the game quickly. Like the larger casinos Fond-du-luth offers a Players Club card that enables gamers to accumulate prize points. The more games played the more points are accrued. With over 750 modern slot machines available the prize points can mount quickly. Players Club members are able to participate in weekly drawings for cash prizes and discounts from local merchants. Seniors Day is conducted every Tuesday between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. for Senior Players Club cardholders. Senior gamers can participate in the special activities designed with the 60+ crowd in mind. The location of Fond-du-luth Casino puts visiting guests close to many fine dining facilities. For those seeking overnight accommodations tourists couldn't ask for a more convenient location. Many of Duluth's finest hotels are close by. The casino offers a shuttle service not only to the area hotels, but to one of their competitors, Black Bear Casino.

The bar offers a wide range of beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. A limited food menu is also conveniently located in the bar area. Make no mistake, this little gaming spot probably wouldn't be considered a gaming destination by many slot and Blackjack enthusiasts, but as the saying goes, you can never tell a book by its cover. The same can be said for this small casino. If visiting Duluth do yourself a favor and stop by this small gaming gem. The casino is open 24 hours daily, 7 days a week."
"Cathedral of St. Paul","Minnesota","Cathedral of St. Paul, Saint Paul, MN","The Cathedral of St. Paul in Saint Paul, Minnesota is part of the Roman Catholic Church. It stands on Cathedral Hill looking out over downtown Saint Paul. It has a few distinctive features that really make it prominent in the city like the copper dome. The church was opened in 1915 in its current building, though the Catholic religion in Saint Paul was around for many years before that. It is also the fourth cathedral of the archdiocese to bear the name Saint Paul. Last year on March 25, 2009 the cathedral was given the designation as the National Shrine of the Apostle Paul by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The Vatican also was behind this decision. In 1904 Archbishop John Ireland decided a cathedral was needed in Saint Paul. He commissioned Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, a French Beaux Arts Architect to design the building. He was also the man who created the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis Missouri. The construction for the cathedral began in 1906. It took a little under 10 years for the building to be completed. Masqueray designed the building to have views of the altar and pulpit from anywhere in the cathedral. Two years after the completion of the building Masqueray died. Unfortunately, at the time of his death the interior designs were not completed. He had also only drawn a few of his ideas for the interior. Other architects were called in over the next few decades to add their input and get the interior completed. When one visits the Cathedral it is to see the amazing architecture based on the French Renaissance period, and most particularly the dome. The dome is 76 feet in diameter and 186 feet high. Gold leaf and warm colors were used in the 50's to make the church inviting. The exterior was created from Rockville Granite that arrived from the Clark Quarry just outside of St. Cloud, Minnesota. The interior walls are Travertine which came from Mankato, Minnesota. The columns are from all types of marble adding a remarkable appearance to the interior. The cathedral like many churches has stained glass windows. The most important windows are featuring Angelic Choirs. A rose window in the transept was created by Charles Connick. The church has seen a few renovations like the 1940's installation of electric lighting. To add to the interior are four evangelists in the four corners of the main structure. Saint Paul is also honored in a bronze baldachin, the bronze Te Deum and Magnificat grilles. The Cathedral honors six other patron saints of Europe in the six chapels that make up the rest of the structure. One important addition in 1987 was the five bronze bells which were cast in France. The bells do toll. Anyone visiting Saint Paul will find the Cathedral is open seven days a week from 7am to 7pm unless a special event is occurring. During special events like weddings the church is closed to tours."

"Dacotah Ridge Golf Club, Morton, Minnesota ? the Only Rees Jones Golf Course in the State, and a 41/2-Star Rating from Golf Digest","Minnesota","Dacotah Ridge Golf Club, Morton, Minnesota ? the Only Rees Jones Golf Course in the State, and a 41/2-Star Rating from Golf Digest","Dacotah Ridge Golf Club is a championship course set amid the rolling hills and prairie landscapes of southwestern Minnesota, and is the only fully designed Rees Jones golf course in the state. The course is set on 240 acres of land, and features a rugged, prairie character that includes natural wetlands, mature trees, a 14-acre lake, and the winding Wabasha Creek. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,109 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 134 on Bent grass. The course is essentially in the middle of nowhere,'' bordered by farm fields and split by the Wabasha Creek, which comes into play on about half the holes. The course features firm fairways with generous landing areas, yet the layout also demands a level of accuracy and caution as the native prairie grasses that border the short grass can grow to be knee-high during the season. The greens are said to be fast and true. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 5, a short par-4 that plays to only 371 yards from the Blue tees. This hole is one of the more picturesque on the course, as it curves clockwise around a pond bordered by rocks. A large fairway bunker at about the midpoint awaits wayward shots, and another huge bunker guards the entire right side of the green. Hole No. 11 is a very picturesque and challenging par-3, with a green that looks more like something expected on a seaside course. The hole only plays to 157 yards from the Blue tees, but calls for a carry over water to a green surrounded by water and breaker-like rock walls to the front and back left. Hole No. 9 is a par-4 that plays to 404 yards from the Blue tees. Tee shots must find safety in an undulating fairway with a sloping drop-off area to the left. Approach shots must then cross a pond that fronts the entire green, which is guarded by a bunker left and scrub beyond. At 552 yards from the Blue tees, Hole No. 18 is the longest on the course and plays along an undulating fairway that's shaped like a reverse letter c. For golfers trying to cut any corners, danger lurks in the form of several water hazards, bunkers, trees and native grasses. Dacotah Ridge Golf Club has gathered a number of honors and awards over the years, including being rated the #3 course in the state for Golfweek's Best Courses You Can Play for 2008, a 4?-Star rating from Golf Digest, and being a Recommended Golf Course to Play in the Midwest by PGA Professionals Guide to Travel.

"Deacon's Lodge Golf Course","Minnesota","Deacon's Lodge Golf Course, Breezy Point, Minnesota - Named Minnesota's #1 Public Golf Course in 2005","The Grand View resort in central Minnesota has been a popular destination for tourists and vacationers since the early 1900s. Golf was only added during the last decade or so, but has since become the prime attraction. The resort now boasts three championship golf courses, as well as a social'' nine-hole course. The Deacon's Lodge Course is the latest in the lineup, and the most highly acclaimed. The course is an Arnold Palmer design (named after his father) and has been hailed as one of his best works. Too much fanfare, the course opened in 1999 and was christened by Palmer and then-Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura as the two played a nine-hole exhibition. The 18-hole, par-72 course is not especially long, playing to 6,964 yards from the Palmer Tees, with a USGA rating of 73.8 and a slope rating of 146 on Penncross Bent grass. From the forward men's tees the course plays to slightly more than 6,000 yards. The course is situated on 150 acres amid Minnesota's mixed forests, wetlands and lakes. In fact, the course touches three lakes - Shaeffer, Lynch and Douglas Lake - which come into play on five holes. The layout has a very rolling, undulating design that will not allow for many even lies. Mature pine and birch trees abound, as well as plenty of native marsh areas that come into play, with ten of the 18 holes requiring carries over wetlands. The course, which sits upon 170 feet of native sand, also features some distinctive waste bunkers, as Palmer made use of that element to create natural waste bunkering reminiscent of the Historic Pine Valley Country Club in New Jersey.  The course also features a number of traditional sand bunkers, with Blue-Fescue grass borders intentionally left long to enhance the presentation. The fairways tend to be generous at 45 total acres, which is about 60% more than the national average, but that's offset by the undulating terrain. The greens are also large, averaging 7,500 square feet, are moderately contoured and are said to play extremely true. Bordering the greens are large, undulating chipping aprons designed to be very similar to those found at Pinehurst in North Carolina. One of the most noteworthy and challenging holes on the course is No. 17, a par-3 that plays to 200 yards from the longest tees. Golfers play from an elevated tee to a green surrounded by marshland on three sides. With sand bunkers to the left and a lake behind it, hitting the green on this hole is mandatory for a good score. Since opening, the course has received much acclaim. GOLF Magazine named Deacon's Lodge one of the Top 10 New Public Courses in the U.S. in 2000, Golf Digest awarded it 4? Stars on its Places to Play list for 2004-2005, and Golfweek Magazine rated it Minnesota's #1 Public Course in 2005. Practice facilities include a driving range with grass hitting surface, as well as short-game practice area with a sand bunker. A variety of golf instruction options are also available.

The Zoo continued growing into the 1940's where it's estimated over 200,000 visitors were entertained annually. The Zoological Park today serves as the home domicile to hundreds of native animals and species from abroad species. Residents on site in recent times include Alaskan grizzly bear, Kodiak bear, polar bear, African Lions, cougars and Siberian tigers just to name of few residents. The central building, built in 1927, houses the Tiger's Paw Gift Shop, the Safari Cafy, and the Siberian tiger viewing platform. The Griggs Learning Center houses outreach animals for instructive purposes. Feeding time is one of the most popular events taking place daily. Children enjoy feeding and interacting with the neighborhood llama, donkey and pigmy goat. The polar bear exhibit is another well-liked location.

The Zoo enclosure is open every day of the year with the exception of New Year's Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Unfortunately, since the Animal Care Center was built, little investment has been made by the City to keep the zoo in good operating condition. Duluth residents truly value having the zoo in their community and the city has developed a new campaign to save their zoo.Local community organizations have stepped up efforts to strengthen support for renovations to the park. The Zoological Society's Board of Directors is now operating the facility while efforts to generate funding are undertaken by the City of Duluth. Once developed to its full potential the park will have a larger educational impact serving the residents of Minnesota and Wisconsin. The zoo's leadership is asking for the public's input on how to improve the attraction not only for the patrons but for the animals as well. Zoo workers have already started on some projects including renovating their aged tiger deck."

The garden and bird sanctuary are located in the middle of the city, which visitors will quickly forget. A trail will take visitors into the garden to enjoy the sounds of birds, insects, frogs and wind in the trees of the 15-acre garden, which is the oldest public wildflower garden in the nation. The gardens history dates back to 1907 when Eloise Butler, who was a botanist, along with other botanists petitioned the Minneapolis Park Board to create a natural botanic garden and preserve the native flora as the city grew. They were given three acres of bog, meadow and hillside, which they fenced and the gardens opened on April 27, 1907. In the gardens are three main ecosystems, a wetland, which is known as Woodland Garden with hardwood forest and oak savanna, the wetland area and the Prairie. There are over 500 different species of plant in the garden along with 120 species of bird, the garden receives approximately 60,000 visitors easy year due to the seasonal displays of native wildflowers that grow in the woodland, wetland and prairie areas. A different habitat is created in each area to allow the different plants, animals and birds to thrive and live comfortably. The trail at the garden is a 2/3 mile trail with 49 interpretive stations allowing visitors on guided or self-guided tours to learn more about the garden and the species in the garden. Natural history displays and reference materials are located in the Martha Crone Visitor's Shelter along with staff and volunteers who are able to help with any questions about the park or how they can plant the species of plants to attract such birds to their home gardens. The Martha E. Crone Visitors shelter was built in 1969 and donated to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board by the Friends of the Wild Flower Garden in honor of Martha E. Crone who became curator of the gardens after Eloise Butler. The peak time to display the gardens are; April and May - in the woodland area where bloodroot, wild ginger and trillium, bluebells and trout lilies are flourishing. In June and July the wetland area has showy lady's-slippers, irises and cardinal flowers in bloom, mid to late summer the prairie has asters, sunflowers, blazing stars and goldenrods and in the fall the beautiful colors of the prairie grasses and autumn leaves. The gardens can be access in many ways, visitors are able to drive their cars and park, but parking is limited, or they can catch the bus, which will drop them off only two blocks from garden gate, signs mark the way, or they can take the Grand Rounds bike route. Along with the flora at the gardens there are many different wildlife species such as raccoons, chipmunks, rabbits, red foxes, squirrels, moles, frogs, turtles and snakes.

"Enger Park and Tower","Minnesota","Enger Park and Tower, Duluth, MN","In 1939 Enger Park and Tower in Duluth, Minnesota was started. It was dedicated by Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway. The land itself was held by Bert Enger for several years until his death. At his death he left the land to the city for a park. He was a businessman in Duluth, originally from Norway, which is why the Crown Prince and Princess were asked to dedicate the land. Enger Park has many distinct gardens within its borders. The gardens show how different the ecosystems of Minnesota can be based on the variety of flowers that grow in them. Even though Duluth is in the northern area of Minnesota many hardy plants survive the cold wintry seasons. On one hill visitors can see dwarf conifers that grow in rock outcroppings. There is also a Japanese Garden with a pavilion and peace bell. There is a sister bell in Duluth's sister city of Japan. The city is Oh Ara. A white birch and popular grove with 4,000 daffodils are also present in the gardens. A shade garden with numerous mature trees and over 200 perennials is also available for visitors to enjoy. Visitors are encouraged to walk towards this section to see the stair steps that are a part of the landscape. By walking up the stairs one can see Lake Superior, which the gardens overlook. It is also possible to see the city from certain areas of the park. Paths wind through the different gardens mostly with gravel, but wood chips and asphalt have also been used. The park is meant for tourists and families to feel as though they are in a community.

"Explore the Lives of Hawks","Minnesota","Explore the Lives of Hawks","The Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory located in Duluth Minnesota provides some of the finest hawk observation opportunities in all of North America. On average it's estimated that over 94,000 raptors travel through or around Hawk Ridge from the mid- August through the end of November every year. The observatory is dedicated to the protection of birds of prey and other birds migrating through the Western Lake Superior Territory. The efforts of the observatory to achieve this goal are accomplished through education of the public, research of the raptors and their habits, and stewardship. Visitors are welcome year round, but the period of mid-August continuing through November is considered to be the peak period for raptor observation. The middle of September can often reward the observant birder with sightings of thousands even tens of thousands of Broad-winged Hawks. During October it's fairly common to see Golden and Bald Eagles, Red-tailed Hawks, Northern Goshawks, and Rough-legged Hawks. During this busy period Naturalists are typically on location to answer questions and help the novice bird watcher with identification of the various raptor species. Raptors typically don't begin flying until after 8am or 9am. The middle of the day presents the best opportunity to observe the diverse raptor species. This is contrary to the activities of most other wildlife which occur primarily in the very early hours or just before nightfall. Sightings usually tend to taper off after 4pm. Weather and wind direction usually play a role in the amount of flight activity taking place on any given day. Although there is never a guarantee, winds from the northwest or westerly direction usually indicate a higher number of bird sightings. Visitors are strongly advised to bring a good pair of binoculars to make their viewing more enjoyable and to assist them in quickly identifying the various species soaring overhead. The staff of the observatory have binocular to loan visitors, but on busy periods there often are not enough to supply everyone. Like any other outdoor activity the weather can change rapidly especially at higher altitudes. Guests of the observatory should bring warm clothing, preferably wind and rain resistant. Sunscreen and a brimmed hat help with protection from the Sun. Beverages and snacks will also help making the visitor more comfortable. A folding chair can often come in extremely handy during extended viewing periods. Hiking is available on the Hawk Ridge trail. Some of the terrain is fairly uneven, so good hiking boots or tennis shoes are recommended. Hawk Ridge encourages pet owners to leave their dogs at home when they visit the observation area. This is particularly important during weekends when visitor traffic can often be heavy. There are food vendors on sight every weekend from mid-September through mid-October offering a variety of food and beverages. Portable bathroom facilities are also located on the observatory grounds during the fall migration season. There is no charge of visiting Hawk Ridge. Adequate parking is usually available in the large parking area. Additional parking for recreational vehicles and buses is located about a mile past the overlook. Be sure to bring the telephoto lenses for your camera. Without some specialized equipment the subject raptors will often only appear as dots in the sky. On occasion, however, the lucky observer on the overlook will be rewarded by a large raptor floating by at eye level."

"Fort Snelling State Park","Minnesota","Fort Snelling State Park, Saint Paul, MN","Fort Snelling State Park in Saint Paul, Minnesota surrounds the actual fort. Fort Snelling was part of the US Northwest development. Today the fort is surrounded by freeways and urban homes, but the government had the fortuitousness to create a park with the surrounding land before it was all commercialized. The land was once home to Native Americans before it was taken over by settlers. The US gained the Upper Mississippi Valley during the Revolutionary War, which is when the fort was built. The territory prior to that time was largely run by fur traders and the remaining Native Americans. In the War of 1812 the government began taking more control of the Northwest. The fort was part of a new movement to allow only citizens to use American rivers. This meant British citizens could no longer use the area for fur trading. Over the next 30 years, from the time Fort Snelling was built, it was considered a hub for the Upper Mississippi. It was a meeting area for Dakota, Okibwe and other settlers in the area. The traders actually had to stop at the fort for their furs to be inspected before they could move on. Many travelers were given lodgings at the fort including Swiss, French, and Scottish immigrants. By 1851 the rules for the fort changed. Territories were being pushed farther west so other forts were created along the way. It meant that Fort Snelling became nothing more than a glorified supply depot. Between the 1880's and 1900's barracks, officers quarters, and storehouses were built near the post. These buildings were eventually demolished as they didn't hold up to the weather and elements. The fort was the only thing made of stone. In World War II it became a place for 300,000 inductees to be trained. In the 1950's the fort was rebuilt and considered a national landmark. It is this building that sits in the park today. The fort is not the only thing to do in the park though. There are many hiking, biking, and skiing trails that run through the park and around the fort. One can canoe on Gun Club Lake, play golf, or even swim in Snelling Lake during the summer. Hiking on Pike Island is a wonderful way to spend the day due to the Mississippi and Minnesota River convergence. Films and exhibits are located at Thomas C. Savage Visitor Center to go over the history of the park and the fort. Firewood restrictions are often placed on the park in summer when the land becomes dry. For outdoor enthusiasts camping, fishing, hiking, and much more is offered. Birding is often popular as the birds head south for the winter and north for summer. Another place to see is the Dakota Memorial. The park is open year round from 8am to 10pm daily. Weather does not stop the park from opening unless it is a huge storm that makes the roads impassable for all of Saint Paul and surrounding areas."

The museum is on the corner of Larpenteur and Cleveland Ave in Falcon Heights. This is just minutes from the University of Minnesota campus in St. Paul. Jane DeBow belonged to a missionary family and in 1833 she and her family left Batavia, New York to go west to work among the Dakota people near Fort Snelling. When Jane met her husband Herman Gibbs the newlyweds traveled to the Minnesota Territory in 1849 where they bought 160 acres of land. This is the land that the Gibbs Farm Museum stands on today. They first lived in a sod house and the remains of this home still remain for visitors to see as well as a replica of their first sod home. The larger cabin was finished in 1854 and additions were added in 1867 and 1873. There was a trail that led from Lake Calhoun to the northern rice lakes that ran across the Gibbs farm. Visitors can visit the farm house and a Dakota style tipi and replica of a bark lodge. The farm house began with a place for a stove and a dry sink, and a loft that was initially used for storage and then as a sleeping area for their children. A single room held a full sized bed and there was a little extra room for their daughter to play in. Once the family began to increase they expanded the farm house in 1867 to quadruple the size. This addition added a parlor, a small room off the parlor and four upstairs bedrooms. The parlor had wall paper, carpeting and fancy furniture which was rather unheard of since the farm was so far from the city of St. Paul. The Gibbs valued education so they donated some land for the schoolhouse and boarded the school teacher in their home. The family had a large garden and needed extra help so they added a hired men's room in 1873. The room housed 6 - 10 men during the growing season. A summer kitchen was added so that the women could be cooler when they prepared meals for the hired men and family. Gibbs farm had many animals which included a team of horses, sheep, cows, chickens and pigs. The sheep most likely were used to make sweaters, socks, blankets, mittens and other types of clothing from their wool. The pigs provided meat to eat and the lard was needed to make soap, candles and food. They had a white barn on the farm by 1910 and a red barn which was designed by a famous architect, Edwin Lundie. Visitors can also see the Stoen School which was moved to the Gibbs Farm Museum in 1966."

Chester and Clara were born to ministers, and they met at Syracuse University in 1875. For six years they waited to get married until finally they were graduated and able to marry. In 1892 they felt a move to Duluth was needed. Chester was an attorney and investor in the Iron Range Land Speculation. By age 50 Chester had amassed quite a fortune and was beginning to take an interest in politics. This was one of the reasons they could afford to build the mansion called Glensheen. Chester died in 1916 with Clara and his daughter Elisabeth still living in Glensheen. Elisabeth adopted two daughters and lived out her life at Glensheen, dying in 1977. For 69 years Glensheen was a family home. The cost for the mansion was 854,000. The ceilings were 16 inches thick, which is one of the reasons it was such an expensive place to build. The family wanted it to be fireproof. They also built a water reservoir on the land to help operate a fountain and supply water. The fountain propelled water 75 feet into the air, but it is no longer running. The main house on the property has 39 rooms with 27,000 square feet of living space. The architecture is rectangular with A frame eaves and more than three fireplaces to give it character. Over 22 acres of land made up the landscape at Glensheen. It was heavily wooded to the shoreline, until the Congdon's began developing the area. They provided gardens that moved around the house, and ended at the woods. Mrs. Congdon wanted to have peace and quiet with very little neighbors, which is why the woods were kept. Tours are offered at Glensheen Estate throughout the year. They have seasonal and year round tours, as well as events at the red brick mansion. One can also take a self guided tour. Hours are 9:30am to 3:30pm Saturday and Sunday during October to mid May.

The Palisades were used to avoid attacks on the products that were being imported and exported. A favorite historical building for visitors to the Grand Portage is the Lookout Tower. Visitors are allowed to climb the tower and see the spectacular view of Lake Superior and all the surrounding grounds. Finally, the Canoe Warehouse was used to provide storage space, but now exhibits historic items like antique canoes. Other areas of the monument are open all year."

"Green Giant Statue Park","Minnesota","Green Giant Statue Park - Blue Earth, Minnesota - Park","The Green Giant Statue Park is located at Giant Drive on Highway 169 off Interstate 90 in Blue Earth, Minnesota. To get to the statue drivers should follow I-90 exit 119 and turn south onto US 169. Driving a further half a mile, visitors should then turn right onto CR-104/Fairgrounds Rd, and then left onto Giant Drive, where the Green Giant can be found behind the Dairy Queen. The Green Giant character was actually created way back in 1925 for the Minnesota Canning Company, and was named after a large variety of peas. He first appeared in advertising for the company in 1928 and his towering presence has presided over the vegetables grown in his valley ever since. As a result of his enormous popularity the company changed their name to Green Giant. The Green Giant statue was permanently erected in 1979 at a cost of $43,000 and is the symbol of food manufacturing company Green Giant, which is owned by General Mills. It is the world's largest statue of the jolly Green Giant standing at 55-feet tall and it attracts over 10,000 visitors each year. The tall imposing figure is made of fiberglass and was made to commemorate the linking of the east and west sections of Interstate 90. The statue was the idea of Paul Hedberg, the owner of a local radio station, who contacted the company in 1977 to see if they would allow their corporate symbol to be immortalized along the new Interstate 90. Green Giant worked with the statue builder Creative Displays of Sparta, Wisconsin to get the accuracy of the character. In the latter part of 1978 a 65 foot crane was used to hoist the new statue in to position for him to overlook the opening of I-90. The park also features several picnic tables for visitors to enjoy their lunches at, and there is also a tourist information center. Accessible via steps, the pedestal of the statue welcomes visitors to Blue Earth, MN, which is a city in Faribault County and is named after the Blue Earth River.

"Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory","Minnesota","Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory, Duluth, MN","Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory in located in Duluth, Minnesota where visitors are able to see migrating raptors. Each year these birds will come from their winter destinations towards their summer breeding grounds. Some of the birds that travel through the observatory have flown as far south as South America and as far north as the Arctic. A plethora of birds will sit on the western tip of Lake Superior before flying on. Since most raptors like to have land in sight they will travel southwest along the shoreline of Lake Superior rather than directly over it. This means the bluffs in East Duluth make a perfect place for observing the birds like the peregrine falcon and gyrfalcon. Certain days are going to be better than others to see the migrating birds. Southerly or easterly winds typically stop the larger birds from flying, but other birds will fly lower making them easier to see. With northwest winds one can see thousands of birds on the migratory path. Kestrels, hawks, and broad winged hawks tend to fly in mid August to the south. Red tailed and rough legged hawks along with eagles will be the last to migrate in December. Peak migration is from September to late October which fits within the autumn season. There are fifteen days in September that are the best with thousands of birds flying from 8am to 4pm,though the most birds fly between 10am and 2pm between September 10th and 25th. Visitors should bring binoculars with them to the observatory. Chairs are also a must have if one plans to stay for a long time. There are very little seating areas created for the public, so a chair to sit on the ridge is very helpful for a day out. Some rocks are available for sitting as well. Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory provides hiking trails, though these trails are rugged. Visitors should be comfortable walking and hiking around boulders. The paths are not for the faint of heart. Pets are allowed at the observatory, but they must be on a short leash. Dogs that are friendly towards adults, kids and other dogs are allowed. Those who may chase the birds should not be brought to Hawk Ridge. On the weekends there are food vendors with lunch service. They have vegetarian choices, water, soda, chips, hot drinks, and other foods. Hawk Ridge is just a place of land with no buildings. This means facilities on site are portable and only available during the fall migratory season. There is some staff located at the ridge that provides demonstrations with banded raptors. There is no charge for coming to Hawk Ridge. However, they do take donations and visitors can become members to help protect the birds, provide support, and research programs. The main overlook for Hawk Ridge is off of Skyline Parkway providing a leisurely drive through Duluth and some of the more beautiful sections found in the city.

"Hinckley Fire Museum","Minnesota","Hinckley Fire Museum - Hinckley, Minnesota - Museum","Hinckley Fire Museum is located on Old Highway 61 at the former Northern Pacific Railway depot in Hinckley, Minnesota. It is open between May and mid October each year from 10am to 5pm Tuesday to Saturday and 12 noon to 5pm on Sundays. The museum remains closed on Mondays and there is free parking on site during the opening hours. The museum stands just a few feet from where the original rail depot burned in the great fire of 1894 that destroyed six towns including Hinckley, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. This terrible event in the history of Hinckley is interpreted in the museum with numerous exhibits and relics that help tell the story of the fire. At least 418 people lost their lives as the fire rampaged through the area to such an extent, that within four hours more than 400 square miles were black and smoldering. It was one of the driest summers on record in the area and fires were common in the woods, along railroad tracks and logging camps making Hinckley very susceptible. Two fires began and eventually joined together creating a huge firestorm that destroyed the towns of Mission Creek and Brook Park first before coming into the town of Hinckley and then three others. The depot was rebuilt immediately after the fire and now visitors can see various rooms and artifacts retained from that period. The museum includes the original men's and women's waiting rooms, the eating area known as the Beanery and the depot agent's apartment. In the Freight Room visitors can watch a documentary video about the fire, which is run every hour and lasts approximately 20 minutes. The story is not just about the fire but also how the town was rebuilt in the ensuing years and the progression into agricultural lands. After viewing the rooms and exhibits here, visitors can purchase some souvenirs and gifts from the onsite shop, which offers various unique items and collectibles. Visitors to the museum in the past have given favorable reviews of the place, commenting on how sobering the story is. They also said the regeneration was very impressive and especially on replanting the forest, which was wiped out by the firestorm. There are numerous places to stay overnight or longer within close proximity to the Fire Museum in Hinckley.

"IDS Building is the tallest building in Minnesota","Minnesota","IDS Building is the tallest building in Minnesota","The IDS Building is the tallest building in the state of Minnesota standing at 792 feet high. The building opened in 1974 and stood at 775 feet and six inches, a 16-foot garage for window washing equipment was added at a later date, adding to the total height of the building. The building was constructed as the headquarters of Investors Diversified Services which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, the Target Corporation also used the building for their headquarters until moving to another building in 2002. Many high-rise buildings in Minneapolis copy the design of the IDS building, particularly their modern glass facing. The bottom of the building is known as the Crystal Court, which provides skyway connections to the rest of downtown. An observation deck is located in the building, but is closed to the public as it is rented by a Minneapolis law firm. The restaurant Windows on Minnesota is located on the 50th floor of the building and is used as banquet space and operated by the Marquette Hotel. Due to the peculiar step-back design of the building, there are 32 corner offices on each floor. Mechanical floors are located at 50 feet above street level and at the very top of the building; these floors are identified by their darker facing. There is 1.4 million square feet of office and retail space in the building. The building has had structural issues such as water leaking through the roof of the Crystal Court after snow or rain; this was due to the effects of Minnesota's extreme freeze-thaw cycle. The front of the IDS Center was used in the Mary Tyler Moore television show where she tossed her hat into the air in the opening sequence. The Wells Fargo Center and Foshay Tower can be seen from certain angles from the building, along with the reflection in the glass facing of the center. The building has two secret floors between the 8th and 9th floors, known as 8A and 8B. The floors are not accessible from any of the passenger elevators and only contain HVAC equipment. Therefore the 9th floor is actually the 11th floor and the 51st floor is really the 53rd. There are communication spires on the top of the building, which make the total height of the tower 910 feet, and the highest point in Minneapolis. Many FM radio station use the building as a backup in case their primary locations fail. Broadcasters who do use the tower include Univision, Home Shopping Network and Amateur radio repeater. The building has been used in many movies, television shows and songs such as in Fargo by Steve Buscemi, in the music video for Remy Zero's `Save Me', in Hold Steady's song `Party Pit' and in the novel The Hiawatha by David Treuer. Three deaths have resulted from falls from the tower, one was an accident when a worker removing snow slipped and fell three stores through the glass canopied atrium to his death. In 2001 and 30 year old man jumped from the 51st Floor and in 1996 a 32 year old man knocked out a window on the 30th floor and jumped to his death."
"Impressive Bridge in Duluth","Minnesota","Impressive Bridge in Duluth","The Aerial Lift Bridge is the pride of Duluth, MN. The 390 foot span is a vertical lift bridge. This uncommon bridge configuration originally had its beginning as an exceptionally uncommon transporter bridge. The bridge was built in the early 1900's, upgraded in 1930 to its present breathtaking design, and remains in operation today. Aerial Lift Bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The highly noticeable bridge crosses the canal referred to as Park Point. The St. Louis River which acts as the dividing line between Minnesota and Wisconsin is located approximately seven miles southeast of the Aerial Lift Bridge. The bridge was built to allow residents to breach the manmade canal. Prior to the final bridge design being determined, residents utilized a ferry system to make their way across the canal. Unfortunately, the weather in this area of the upper Midwest rendered ferry travel impossible during the winter months. The original draft of the bridge incorporated a bridge and a suspended gondola, a design attributed to the French, capable of transporting up to 350 people along with their carriages or wagons. The bridge capacity at that point was approximately 60 short tons which could also accommodate streetcars and automobiles. The journey across took about one minute. The gondola car usually made it across the small divide every five minutes during peak traffic periods. Heavy demands attributed to an increased population in the Duluth and Minnesota Point areas, as well as, an increase in the tourist industry resulted in the need to substantially upgrade the design of the bridge. The present structural configuration incorporating the lifting platform was opened in 1930. The top span of the bridge can be raised to accommodate both pleasure crafts and commercial vessels cruising back and forth from the Lake Superior. It takes about 3 minutes for the bridge to be raised to its full summit. It's estimated that the span is raised and lowered up to 30 times daily, or 5,500 times annually, during the peak shipping period. Site-seers are excited as they anticipate the raising of the span and the time-honored horn-blowing series that takes place each time the bridge is raised. Horn blasts of long-short-long-short signify the raising of the span, often accompanied by a friendly welcome signal of long-short-short. The bridge remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in Minnesota. Shipping schedules are printed in the Duluth Shipping News available at the Lake Superior Marine Museum located close to the bridge. The Museum also posts the arrival and departure times via monitors located on the premises. The Lake Superior Marine Museum is well worth visiting while in the vicinity of the Aerial Lift Bridge. The Aerial Lift Bridge anchors Canal Park and the beginning of this portion of the Lake walk. The bridge is owned and operated by the City of Duluth. The Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center also offers visitors a unique opportunity to view replicas and artifacts from the Lake Superior and Great Lakes region. Once visitors to the Aerial Lift Bridge have completed viewing the bridge operation and the surrounding waterfront activities, the City of Duluth offers a vast array of dining and shopping opportunities."

"James J Hill Mansion","Minnesota","James J Hill Mansion, Saint Paul, MN","James J Hill was instrumental in the development of the Northwest Railroad, specifically around Saint Paul, Minnesota. Hill was born in 1838 and died around 1910. During his life time he built the James J Hill Mansion or as some refer to it as the Hill House. At his death Hill was worth an estimated $63 million. One person is said to have asked him how he managed to become so wealthy. His response was work, hard work, and smart work. It was partly due to his purchase of the near bankrupt St. Paul and Pacific Railroad in 1878 that helped his wealth accrue. It was this railway that he renamed the Great Northern Railway. Visitors are able to take a tour or event at James J Hill Mansion when they come to Saint Paul. The house is such a large estate that it has been used for numerous events, even concerts. In 2010 it was the site of a Chopin concert as represented by Eric Himy. The house itself was completed in 1891 and was the largest, most expensive location in Minnesota. It is 36,000 square feet with five floors, 13 bathrooms, 22 fireplaces, and 16 crystal chandeliers. It also has a two story skylit art gallery with a 100 foot reception hall. Oak, mahogany, and other woods were used throughout to create the magnificent carvings tourists can see on their visit. When the home was completed it cost $931,275.01, which was quite a bit for the late 1800's. The home sat on three acres with landscaping included in the cost mentioned previously. For 30 years Hill family members remained in the home. Even after Hill died in 1916 his wife remained. She died five years later. In 1925 the family members purchased the home from the estate and turned it over to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese in St. Paul. During the next half a century the mansion was used for services, an office building, school, and residence for the church. In 1978 the historical society acquired the property. However, it was named a landmark in 1961. Today the house is open for tours on Wednesdays through Saturdays 10am to 3:30pm. It is also open on Sundays from 1 to 3:30pm. Anyone who wishes a tour should make reservations to ensure their visit is successful. When events are going on there are no tours.

The exposed surface is approximately 150 feet by 650 feet and is surrounded by virgin prairie. The Minnesota Historical Society purchased the site from W.R. Jeffers Jnr. in 1966 and four years later it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. There are over 2,000 images embedded in the rock created by using a hammer stone of Sioux quartzite or a rock harder of equal hardness such as a chert cobble. The petroglyphs illustrate various types of wildlife such as bison, salamanders, turtles, elk as well as human stick figures, and various weapons like atlatls, spear points, arrowheads, and lances. It is believed that the oldest carvings date back 7000, to 9,000 years ago, while the most recent are only 150 to 250 years old. Touring the site can take anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours and staff on site will help visitors to explore the carvings and provide detailed explanations.

"Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad","Minnesota","Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad, Duluth, MN","Much of Minnesota's big cities like Saint Paul and Duluth were formed on the railroad. In Duluth they had the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad that operated for several years to bring goods and people to the northwest state. Today visitors and locals in Duluth can take a 1.5 hour trip that takes riders to the shoreline of St. Louis River Estuary, Spirit Lake and Mud Lake. The route is a historic journey in which riders can see the wildlife and natural environments of Duluth along the way. The ride takes tourists over the 130 year old track in which numerous curves can be found. The curves take one through the hills, woods, and mountains of Duluth. The train being used is not quite as old as the track, having been built over 80 years ago. There are inside coaches as well as outdoor cars for the best viewing. Throughout the trip riders will be able to listen to a narration of the track and railroading history. Those running the railroad are volunteers within the non- profit organization. The train moves across the Burlington Northern Santa Fe track, which is now owned by the city of Duluth. The LS&M maintain the track as well as the BNSF portion. The actual Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad operated in 1863 taking goods and people between Duluth and the Twin Cities. The last spike of the track was placed in 1870 near Thompson. The track was created to run from Carlton to Thompson along the St. Louis River through Fond Du Lac, Morgan Park, West Duluth, until it made its way downtown of Duluth. Passengers were first taken along the route in 1870 when operations began. Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad only lasted until 1877. It was then purchased by St. Paul and Duluth before it was placed in the Northern Pacific System. Later on the railroad relocated to make the grade easier for the West Duluth and Carlton leg. The new split was placed near what is now the Lake Superior Zoo. Service on the line continued until the 1930's. In 1981 the present railroad called Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was started. The volunteers wanted to remember the history of the railroad, so they decided to open up rides along the original track to include the scenic St. Louis River. The schedule for the railroad can change from year to year. It depends slightly on the weather and the funds to run the train along the track. Typically the train runs on weekends from June to October. They do have some trains on Labor Day and before the 4th of July. Departures are 10:30am and 1:30pm. Admission is $10.50 per adult and $6.50 for children. Children under 3 are free.

The building it is housed in was built in 1892 in the French Chateau style. It was a hub for the railroad during much of the 1900's, most particularly in 1910 when seven railroads were dispatched from the depot. This meant 50 trains a day would move through Duluth. There was a waiting room called the Immigrants' Waiting Room that was much like Ellis Island in New York. It was a place for new arrivals in the west to make their connections or get off the train. In war periods soldiers used the streets to wait for their train. The last train to ever leave the station was in 1969 for commercial and residential use. In 1973 the city began to restore the depot to its former glory, as well as create the Lake Superior Railroad Museum.

The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,058 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 74.2 and a slope rating of 142. From the White tees, the course plays to a much more manageable 6,046 yards. The course tends to feature generous landing areas and large greens, but the approach shots are often made demanding by greenside mounding and bunkers. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 6, a somewhat lengthy par-4 that plays to 452 yards form the back tees. This is the #1-handicap hole on the course, and it is representative of the style of golf on holes that are not touched by water or wetlands. This hole feels as though it's in a winding trough or valley, borderd by sparse trees, mounding and bunkers. The hole plays slightly downhill to an expansive green, but staying in the short grass and finding a flat lie is the challenge on this layout. Hole No. 10 starts to show some of the water hazards found on the Legends Club, as the fairway of this short par-4 plays plays through water that borders both sides. The hole then takes a subtle dogleg left and plays toward a slightly elevated green that's fronted on the left by two large bunkers. Hole No. 13 is a beauty, a signature hole that's also quite challenging. A somewhat lengthy par-3, the hole plays to 209 yards from the back tees and a respectable 157 from the Whites. This hole plays over the largest body of water on the course, and only the lengthy ride on the wooden bridge might feel longer than the tee shot. Hole No. 16 takes golfers back to more of a dry, links-style hole, and this one is a brute. A par-5, this hole plays to 621 yards from the longest tees, and a still-hefty 580 yards from the Blue tees. This hole plays very straight and seems to stretch as far as the eye can see, but the challenge comes not only from its length, but from the mounding and undulations encountered on the way to an expansive green. Since opening in 2001 the Legends Club has garnered some impressive awards. Golfweek magazine has ranked the course as one of the Top 3 courses in the state, and the #1 Course in the Greater Minneapolis/St.Paul area. And Golf Digest ranked it among the Top 10 Best New Upscale Courses in America in 2002. Practice facilities are also considered some of the finest in the state and include a Bent grass driving range with target greens, sand bunkers, and more than one acre of teeing area. There are also two large practice putting greens, with chipping areas and practice sand bunkers. Instruction is also available. The clubhouse at the Legends Club is a 24,000-square-foot stucco facility situated high above the golf course. The clubhouse features a Golf Shop, locker rooms, elegant dining room, grill, lounge, and an outdoor pavilion."
"Lester Park","Minnesota","Lester Park, Duluth, MN","The name Lester Park might be a bit confusing for someone who has not been to Duluth, Minnesota. Lester Park is not the name of a park; instead, it is the name of a neighborhood in the city. The neighborhood contains London Road, Superior Street and Glenwood Street for its main routes. One reason someone might wish to visit Lester Park is for its festival. Each year since 1998 there has been a festival in the streets of Lester Park. It is called the Lester River Rendezvous, which takes place in September. Many people from Minnesota and outside of the state will come to the festival. It provides a neighborhood feeling and a community togetherness that some festivals lack. The event is sponsored by Lakeside- Lester Park Business Association and Duluth Parks and Recreation Department. Each fall there are always foods, entertainment, and crafts for people to purchase and have fun. Inside the neighborhood is a park, also called Lester Park. It is a small children's park, with more fields and trees than any trails or hardcore outdoor activities. One of the more special parts of the festival is the Voyageur Village. When people go into the village they are enacting a day in the life of voyageurs who arrived in the 18th century. Many local residents dress up in costumes from the fur trading era. They also demonstrate outdoor cooking techniques and tell stories of historic times. Games for the children and pony rides are offered by the Duluth Children's Museum. The park has a stage where most performers will be, but some will stand at the entrance or stroll around the park. Within Lester Park neighborhood are historical places to visit. Along Lester River is Lester River Bridge. The bridge is numbered 5772. It has made the list of the National Register of Historic Places. Also in the neighborhood is the United States Fisheries Station. The station was built in 1882 at the mouth of the river. Currently the fishery is owned by the University of Minnesota Duluth. It also houses the Great Lakes Aquarium administration offices, though this is a temporary situation. The complex has a hatchery, bunk room, boat house, pump house, and supervisor cabin on the south side of Congdon Boulevard. The superintendent's place is on the north side of the same street. Visitors to Lester Park during the festival will want to check out these two historical places as well as some of the neighborhoods around Lester Park. Morley Heights, Congdon Park, North Shore, and Lakewood Township are also historical neighborhoods with numerous houses that date back to the early history of the city. There is a self walking tour visitors can take of Lester Park and Lakeside. For example the park in which the festival is held was known as Stearns Park. There is a footbridge that allows visitors to enter the park. The bridge was built in 1897 and makes quite a photo. There is also Seven Bridges Road which is a stone bridge built in 1912. It replaced a few of the wooden bridges."
"Loring Park is the largest park in central Minneapolis","Minnesota","Loring Park is the largest park in central Minneapolis","Loring Park is located at the north end of the Whitney bridge, which spans Hennepin/Lyndale in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The park is the largest park in central Minneapolis and is also the name of the neighborhood that surrounds the park. The park is 33.94 acres in size along with 7.08 acres of water. The park was designed by American landscape architect Horace Cleveland, a small lake and walking and biking paths are part of the park. The park was originally named Central Park, and then renamed in honor of Charles M. Loring. During the summer the park hosts `Movies in the Park', where films are shown on a drive-in movie screen, while visitors are waiting for the movie, they are entertained by a live band. The Twin Cities GLBT Pride Festival is held at the park and on the last Friday of each month cyclists meet for Critical Mass. Loring was known as the Father of Minneapolis Parks, he was a part commissioner in the legislation that created the park board and was elected by other commissioners to be president of the new board. He promoted park efforts and planted the first trees in Minneapolis west of the Mississippi River. Loring was a successful merchant who ran a dry goods store, then became the speaker of Minnesota House of Representatives that passed the act that created the Board of Park Commissioners. Loring made the case in 1893 that playgrounds were needed in city parks for children. He also made many significant donations to the park board when he was park commissioner, he donated the shelter and warming house that is beside the pond, and to help complete the artificial waterfall he contributed further funds. His last contribution was $50,000 to be put in a permanent trust, which is to plant and maintain the trees on Victory Memorial Drive, which honors American soldiers killed in battle. After the lake was expanded in 1884 the park board created a skating rink on the pond and was the first provision for active recreation in parks. The following year electric lights were installed to illuminate the rink. An artesian well was installed next to the lake in 1887 to provide an uninterrupted flow of fresh water. Other activities in the park included a bandstand and two tennis courts. The park was the center for pitching horseshoes and continues to have an active horseshoe league. The park was the site of dramatic and musical performances since early days, many theatrical performances were held at the park. When the Lake of Isles and Lake Calhoun were linked with Loring Park a celebration was held and attracted over 25,000 people for each performance held in the park. The park was one of the first parks to have a wading pool installed with state requirements of continuously circulating water. The park is smaller today than it once was yet the park still remains a vital and useful park for visitors who prefer active or passive recreation. The park is an oasis of vegetation and water in the heart of the city and remains testimony to the vision of the park planners. The television series Man V Food's first season finale was filmed in the park and is named by Craig Finn in the bands Lifter Puller and Hold Steady."

"Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota","Minnesota","Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota","The Metrodome is officially known as the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, and located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The domed sports stadium was constructed to replace the aging Metropolitan Stadium. The dome is the second oldest major league baseball, and the eleventh oldest in the National Football League. Common nicknames for the stadium include the Dome or HHH Metrodome or the Homerdome. The Metrodome was officially opened on April 3rd, 1982, and is used for all major sporting events held in Minneapolis. The facility is owned by the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission of Minnesota, and the cost of construction was $68 million. The Metrodome was designed by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. The dome has a seating capacity of 45,564 which extends to 55,883 for baseball, 64,111 for football, and 50,000 for basketball. The stadium has had different surfaces over the years, from 1982-1986 the surface was Super Turf, from 1987-2003 the surface was Astro Turf, and as of 2004, the surface is composed of Field Turf. The dome has provided the three major sports teams of Minnesota with a primary purpose, to provide a climate-controlled environment for sporting events. Developing the dome in the Downtown East neighborhood took many years to come to fruition. However, in recent years, the area around the dome has begun to develop with more bars, restaurants and parking, which has made the area more convenient for visitors. Dome construction began on December 20th, 1979, and funding came from the state of Minnesota. The stadium is named after Hubert H. Humphrey, the former mayor of Minnesota, U.S. Senator and U.S. Vice President who had passed away in 1978. When construction of the dome was finished, the final costs came $2 million under budget, a rare occurrence for a modern stadium. The Metrodome is the only sports stadium to host a Major League Baseball All-Star Game, a Super Bowl, an NCCA Final Four, and a World Series. The Metrodome is recognized as one of the loudest'' domes stadiums in the U.S., due to the fact that noise is recycled throughout the stadium because of the domed roof. The roof of the dome is composed of two layers of Teflon with a coated fiberglass fabric, and to maintain constant temperature inside the dome, guests enter and leave the facility using revolving doors. The Metrodome invites guests to relax in a climate controlled environment rife with the modern conveniences the park offers. The dome is conveniently accessible by Interstate 94 and Interstate 35W, and bus and charter service to the games is also available for a nominal fee. Guests are invited to tailgate in a large parking lot known as Rapid Park. Visitors will experience an environment like no place else, the Metrodome is one of the truly most unique domed sports stadiums in the United States."

The markets feature a range of locally produced meats and poultry, farm fresh eggs and other fresh produce along with many arts, crafts and furniture created by members of the community. The markets are part of the Central Minnesota Vegetable Growers Association, which is member-based, non-profit organization with over 200 members. Members of the association market the fruits, vegetables and farmstead products at the Farmers Market. The association helps members improve production methods and marketing strategies for members through partnerships with University of Minnesota, Minnesota Department of Agriculture and the Minnesota Grown Promotional Board. Members are given information on sustainable growing practices such as greenhouse and hydroponics to grow fields of fruit and vegetables. The Famers Market began at the Lyndale Market in 1937 and has been a source of fresh produce and products for the Twin Cities community and visitors to the regions. The Minneapolis outdoor Fruit and Vegetable Market, which was the precursor of today's Market, opened in 1876 and was one of the few places to source fresh produce at the time. Customers from up to 20 miles away would travel - by horse and cart, to obtain fresh produce. Over the years the markets have continued to grow and are now located in their third venue, the markets are marked by the three signature red sheds that cover the market. There are approximately 230 vendors who alternate the 170 stalls and have now added the Nicollet Mall Market area to accommodate the vendors. A series called Market Talk Learning Series was developed for Market customers to educate them about the products available at the Market. The talks are held by local chefs of farmers who will start the talk with a demonstration of how to cook or use the product is the feature of the talk. The speaker will explain the benefits of the products, how it is grown and how to use the vegetables that may look `funny' in meals. Free samples, recipes cards and the opportunity to ask questions are available at the end of the talk. The talks are free each Saturday morning from 10.30 am next to the Market office, the talks are held rain or shine. Seating is available for 45 people and standing room for more, the talks run for around the hour and visitors who watch the entire session are the first to receive the samples and recipe cards. The Minneapolis Farmers Markets are a great place to bring the whole family. A place for children to see and learn about fresh produce, to encourage them to grow their own vegetables and for adults to learn themselves about the benefits of purchasing produce that has not had to travel a great distance and the difference in the freshness. The markets are also an enjoyable way for visitors to spend a Saturday wandering the stalls to see what bargains they can pick up."

The centerpiece of the garden - Spoonbridge and Cherry was created by Claes Oldenburg who is known for his oversized renditions of ordinary objects. He was asked to design a fountain-sculpture for the garden; the spoon appears in many of Oldenburg's works and became the theme for the garden's project. The Cherry was contributed by Van Bruggen as a playful reference to the garden's formal geometry. Bruggen also created the pond shape in the form of a linden seed, these trees were planted along the alleys before the fountain was created. The 5,800 pound spoon and 1,200 pound cherry were built in a shipbuilding yard in New England and become a beloved icon of the garden. The `Garden Seating, Reading, Thinking' sculpture was created in 1987 by Kinji Akagawa and combines the simplicity of Japanese aesthetics with a concern for the impact of art on public places. The artist wanted this sculpture to be used for private activities such as reading and thinking. The bench is made from unfinished green basalt and highly polished granite, a horizontal slab of cedar, which recalls the forest from the regions past is also used. Free tours of the gardens are held during May until September with an Art on Call Audio Guide. Garden, Gallery and Architecture tours are offered at the Walker for free.

"Minnesota Centennial Showboat","Minnesota","Minnesota Centennial Showboat, Saint Paul, MN","As big cities go, Saint Paul, Minnesota certainly has a number of tourist attractions. One could spend a month in Saint Paul without seeing all of the tourist spots. For those limited on time one place to go is the Minnesota Centennial Showboat. The showboat has quite a history as a theater. It is docked at Harriet Island Regional Park, which is on the banks of the Mississippi River. Any guest of the city will most likely see it as they pass by. When one goes to the Showboat for a theater production they will be sent back in time to the Victorian age. The dycor is definitely Victorian with a grand staircase one might think belongs in a mansion. The richest section of the showboat is the 225 seat jewelbox theatre. Despite the looks of the Centennial Showboat it is not that old. The Original Centennial Showboat was opened by the University of Minnesota in 1958 to celebrate the 100 years of Minnesota's statehood. In 1993 the original showboat was closed. This was after 36 seasons of shows. The city felt it should be closed for renovation to update it a little bit. Unfortunately funds needed to be raised and before the renovations could be completed tragedy struck. In winter of 2000 a fire started by a welding spark burned the boat to its hull. A new showboat had to be built. The work was completed by July 2002. The Centennial Showboat seen on the river today is the 2002 version. The original boat is much older than the show though. The actual boat was commissioned in 1899 by General John Newton. It was a 175 foot paddle wheeler used as a court house during some of its history. History states that four US presidents visited the boat. Anyone wishing to see a show has that option Friday and Saturday Evenings at 8pm for $30. Tuesday through Thursday evening shows are also at 8pm, but for $27, and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday Matinees at 2:30pm are $25. They offer discounts for groups and those with certain IDs. Students are able to get in for $25. There are also dinner shows on the weekends which cost a little more than the regular theatre show. Since the Minnesota Centennial Showboat is a theater the productions will vary, but most often they have to do with the 1800's right around the time the city was formed. One gets to see what life could have been like in the Old West. The Players producing the show are a unique troupe because they are all University Students. This means the players will change as students move on and graduate. Part of the theater offers workshops for school aged children. Youths who think they are interested in becoming actors or just want to try out the theater can be involved in the productions. They get to learn about the history of the theater, a little bit on how to act and much more in the programs."

They have had a few rough times in recent years, but like any non- profit organization they are surviving. They had had a few changes in the last year to help keep the museum afloat. In fact they even had to close for a while due to lack of funds. The art collections are now on display again as of 2010. This museum is the oldest one displaying out in the region. It dates back to the 1890's. It got its start with the St. Paul School of Fine Arts in 1894. By 1926 the museum was incorporated as part of the school of arts. At the time they had Dewey Albinson and George Resler as their professors. From the 30's the museum continued to grow their collections, gaining Chinese Jade Pieces in the 40's. In the 50's the museum was named the Saint Paul Gallery and School of Art, but later renamed the Saint Paul Art Center. Whatever the name the Minnesota Museum of Art has a myriad of collections running from local artists to worldwide pieces. Currently the permanent collection houses 3500 objects from the 19th century to present. Many of the collected pieces are from local artists as mentioned before. The permanent collection is not on display at the moment, but there are some traveling exhibits that will be soon. The permanent collection will also be back in 2010 at some point. The image gallery has works by Dewey Albinson, Thomas Hart Benton, Prophet William Blackmon, Cameron Booth, Nicholas Brewer, and Joan Brown. Also in the image gallery are Rose Cabat, Patrick DesJarlait, Alexis Fournier, Wanda Gag, Francis Cranmer Greeman, Clementine Hunter, Elsa Jemne, and Wolf Kahn. Many of these artists were born in the United States practicing art in New York. However, there are local Minnesotans like George Morrison of Chippewa City. Other artists are from places like Stuttgart Germany. For example Wolf Kahn was born in Germany, but lives in New York and Brattlesboro, Vermont now. An upcoming exhibit at the MMAA is the Generation Abstraction in which a number of Minnesota art will be on display that deals in the abstract. The exhibit begins on March 11, 2010 and will end on March 23, 2010. Past exhibits have also been numerous with Crate 1 and 2, Coming of Age a Photography Journey, Minnesota Biennial 3D, In Her Own Right, and Sound in Art.

Since the 2009 closure it is unsure if the hours will change. There are plenty of supports of the museum to keep it open several days a week. One can assume they will have weekend and weekday hours similar to those of the past, but visitors should contact the museum before attending."

"Minnesota State Capitol","Minnesota","Minnesota State Capitol, Saint Paul, MN","The State Capitol of Minnesota celebrated its 100 years in 2005. The building for the State Capitol is, of course, located in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972 due to the age and well maintained building that it is. The historical society is responsible for all furnishings and artwork kept at the building. They are even the company that provides tours to visitors. In 1905 thousands of Minnesotans went to view the Capitol for the first time. They wandered the halls and looked at the 12 years of hard work. Surprisingly, the current building was one of three. In the first few years of the capitol being in Saint Paul two other buildings were created. The first was on Cedar Street in 1853. Unfortunately things were not quite settled during this time and territorial disputes were on going. In 1881 the building was destroyed by a fire and the same site was used two years later to create a new structure. This time the building was a Victorian creation, but it too became unusable. Instead of fire, though, it was said to be too cramped and stuffy. With a number of complaints it was decided a new State Capitol had to be built. This second building was in use until 1937 as a public building even though the Capitol had been moved. In 1937 the building was so old and in need of repair that the city decided to demolish it instead. The building which visitors can tour today was one of forty plans turned in to the city. Bidding was opened up for submissions and many were patterned after Chicago's White City look. The winning entry was submitted by Cass Gilbert, a local architect of 35 years old. Gilbert was known for his elegant drawings and watercolors throughout the city, and in the 1890's he became known for his architecture as well. The Minnesota State Capitol is located on 75 Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd, which is just north of downtown Saint Paul. As it is a part of the Historical Society the admission and hourly tours are free. Hours will vary from Monday to Friday 8:30am to 5pm, Saturday 10am to 3pm and Sunday 1pm to 4pm. The guided tours are offered Monday through Saturday between 10am to 2pm and Sunday at 1, 2, or 3pm. In other words, there are no tours that begin after an hour till close. It is possible to sign up for group tours with a reservation. The society often allows school groups and other large groups to tour the place. Much of the exhibits detail the history of the building and Saint Paul. A great deal of artwork by local artists as well as some who are well known hangs on the walls. The furnishings are period pieces that fit within the realm of the capitol being built and over the years it was used."

"Minnesota's North Shore Scenic Drive","Minnesota","Minnesota's North Shore Scenic Drive, Duluth, MN","Minnesota is known for its beauty, lakes, and coastal region on Lake Superior. Visitors to Minnesota and more specifically Duluth may want to take advantage of Minnesota's North Shore Scenic Drive. The scenic byway begins in Duluth running from Canal Park to the north. Along the parkway is unspoiled land with sweeping shorelines and the world's largest freshwater lake. Many tourists find the magnificent cliffs to be the highlight of their drive due to the amazing splendor of water, cliff, and grassland available to see. It is certainly one of the more picturesque drives through North America. Beaches and the Sawtooth Mountains are also along the scenic drive where rivers and streams will make their way alongside the asphalt highway at certain points before lakes make their appearance again. North Shore provides some communities with homes, historic museums, shopping, dining, lodging, and plenty of culture. Luckily, for those who wish to stop often for the views and entertainment there will be plenty of opportunity. At the end of North Shore Scenic Drive is Grand Portage. The drive is 154 miles of coastline and Minnesota wilds. Along the path visitors should stop to gain more knowledge about the history of the North Shore. For example it is thought that 10,000 years ago the first people arrived on the North Shore. The Native Americans entered the region when Wisconsin began to thaw from the glaciers formed during the Ice Age. By 1620 the first Europeans made their way from the east coast to begin fur trading, and by 1780 the St. Louis River and Grand Portage were important fur trading posts. Eventually life turned away from fur trading to logging, railroads, and other industrial requirements. When taking the North Shore Scenic Drive visitors should plan to be driving for the entire day. In fact a stay in Grand Portage at a local Bed and Breakfast is warranted to see all of the places of interest along the way. Cities that run through the byway include Castle Danger and Taconite Harbor. Visitors traveling the road should take into consideration the weather. Even in summer the northern sections of the road can be quite cool. A light jacket is most often required. In winter the road can be very difficult to drive with heavy snowfall. For this reason travelers may wish to go from late spring to early autumn. In autumn the beauty of Minnesota's North Shore Scenic Drive will alter greatly from summer. In summer one can expect lush greenery amid the cliffs and waterfalls. However, in autumn the leaves turn to gold, orange, and red replacing much of the green with a picturesque landscape. Recreation along the way will be plentiful for those who might want to stay at different places along the scenic byway. The North Shore offers camping, biking, skiing, snowmobiling, canoeing, and fishing. There are also a couple of places where lighthouses sit atop the cliffs looking out over Lake Superior. These houses can be toured."

"Nickelodeon Universe","Minnesota","Nickelodeon Universe - Bloomington, Minnesota - Family-Oriented Theme Park","Nickelodeon Universe is a family-oriented, 7-acre theme park located within the world famous Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. It was first opened in the summer of 1992 by Knott's Berry Farm and was known as Camp Snoopy at that time. In January of 2006, it briefly became known as the Park at MOA due to licensing problems in regards to the Peanuts/Snoopy brand name. At that time, all traces of the Peanuts theme were removed and replaced with more generic visuals. In 2007, a new licensing deal with Nickelodeon triggered the most recent change to Nickelodeon Universe. At that time, some of the more generic elements were replaced with some of the popular Nickelodeon network elements that are so popular with fans of the park today, some of which can be seen in many of the top rides. For instance the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge is modeled after the Gerstlauer-style coasters of Europe and features characters from the popular SongeBob SquarePants show while the Rugrats Reptarmobiles, a ride for young visitors, is based on characters from the popular Rugrats franchise. The rest of the attractions and rides at Nickelodeon Universe run the gamut from very mild to suit the sensibilities of young riders and young visitors to thrill rides to suit the sense of adventure of adult park goers. Some of the more popular attractions include but are not limited to the following. The Splat-O-Sphere is the centerpiece of the park and offers riders a thrilling drop-ride experience. The Avatar Airbender is a located nearby and is built after the surf-rider ride model.

The Log Chute is a log flume style attraction that has also been around since the park first opened in 1992. When it comes to food options, Nickelodeon Universe has a couple to choose from including Caribou Coffee, Kemps Ice Cream Cafy, and several food kiosks. At various times in the park's history, sit-down dining has also been available. Individual options pretty much cover traditional amusement park fare such as hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, ice cream, cotton candy, popcorn, and soft drinks. Several retail shops where park goers can purchase souvenirs such as t-shirts, plushies, and various Nickelodeon-related items are available for the convenience and pleasure of visitors as well.

The statue is not only animated, but programmed to talk as well, welcoming each child into the park by name. The park itself is moderately sized and includes a varied selection of rides, 30 different buildings, and a number of other attractions.

However, eventually the cost of running the park became too much for the owners in 2003 and it was sold to a business called This Old Farm along with the famous Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox statues and moved to its current location in Brainerd on Highway 18. The rides at Paul Bunyan Land cover all the bases when it comes to the classics with everything you would expect to find at an amusement park represented and accounted for. These include but are not limited to a beautiful painted carousel, a classic tilt-a-whirl, a ferris wheel that offers riders a breathtaking bird's eye view of the entire park, and even a family-appropriate roller coaster.

"Preserving Lake Superior Maritime Heritage","Minnesota","Preserving Lake Superior Maritime Heritage","The Lake Superior Maritime Museum has made it their mission to ... preserve the maritime heritage of Lake Superior and the Port of Duluth-Superior...'' They cooperate with a Corps of Engineers to preserve and exhibit artifacts, documents, and photographs, and they work to fund the development and presentation for schools and events, educating the public about the rich maritime history of the area. They also support the Lake Superior Maritime Collection at the University of Wisconsin - Superior. All of this is done through the growing membership of the museum, as well as citizens who volunteer and work to make the mission happen. An important part of the museum's collection is the Fresnel Lens. This lens has a vast history that includes lighting the Inner Range Light on the South Pier of the Duluth Ship Canal. The installation of the lens occurred in 1901. In 1995 the Coast Guard installed a new plastic lens, and gave the original Fresnel lens to the Maritime Museum. The estimated value of this lens is $250,000. It is considered a classic rotating 5th Order Fresnel, featuring six flash panels, and it has its original mechanical clockworks. The refurbishing of the lens began in 2001 by Jim Dunlap. He cleaned the pieces, rebedding them in putty, and reassembled the lens. The base was moved from the second floor of the museum to the Knowlton Gallery. The lens has since had an electric motor installed to turn the gear, and a very small light was added. The museum features a variety of seafaring exhibits in addition to the lens. School and community groups are encouraged to visit the museum and can plan a field trip during the week by calling ahead. Admission to the museum is free. School visits take about 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Groups can range in size from 20 to 50 people, but there are occasions when larger groups can be accommodated. The museum asks that there be one adult chaperone for every 8 to 10 student. Most of the tours begin in the meeting room where students are given a seminar about the museum before touring the exhibits. Restrooms and drinking fountains are available in the lower level of the museum and the facility is handicap accessible. There are numerous educational programs available at the museum including Rail Meets Sails, for fourth graders through adults. This program demonstrates shipping activities that occur in the Duluth-Superior Harbor and the Great Lakes. There are hands-on parts of the program that allow kids to touch taconite, coal, grain, and other cargo. The All Aboard program is designed for kindergarten through fourth grade and takes kids on a tour of a ship's pilothouse, living quarters, and engine room. Groups must be 15 students or smaller. The Great Lakes Question is another option for fourth graders through adults, and this program explores conservation of the Great Lakes. Children are asked to consider how they would maintain the delicate balance of the lake systems ecosystem.

"Ride the Rails by the Lake and River","Minnesota","Ride the Rails by the Lake and River","The Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad was in operation until 1877 when it was sold and became a part of the Northern Pacific System. This was the first railroad linking the Twin Cities and Duluth. The first passenger trains began operating in the fall of 1870. The railroad relocated after 1877 in order to eliminate the curves and ease the grade between the western part of Duluth and the town of Carlton. This new line split up the route at what is not the Lake Superior Zoo. The original route continued as the Northern Pacific System that rain train service to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin until the 1930's. The present day system of the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad incorporated in 1981 and became the Lake Superior Transportation Club. Visitors to Duluth can now hop aboard this historic railroad and tour the original rails that were used during the height of freight travel. The trip takes riders along the shore of the St. Louis River estuary on a one and a half hour ride. The train also passes Spirit Lake and Mud Lake. While on board, riders are able to view wildlife and the beautiful scenery of the river and the surrounding lands. The ride gives train enthusiasts a chance to ride on the 130 year old rail, featuring the original curves that were worked out over time as the rail changed. You will board the restored coaches that are more than 80 years old and hear a narration of the history of how the rails were back in the day during the early days or railroading. The railroad is operated by a volunteer, non-profit group and the track is owned by both the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight track age and the City of Duluth. The track is maintained by the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad. Riders are pulled by the General Electric Center Cab 50T Type Industrial Switcher that was created in 1946.

Riders travel in one of two coaches, or in The Safari Car. Coach 29 was built in 1912 and was remodeled in 1939. It is very similar to its original state. Coach 85 was also built in 1912 and was converted into a crew bunk car, but refurbished with seats in the 1950's. These cars were purchased by the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad and rebuilt in an effort to recreate the rail experience for riders. They are safe and restored, but every attempt was made to keep them in their original form. The Safari Car was built by Siems-Staubel, Co., of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1928.

"S.S. William A. Irvin Ore Boat Museum","Minnesota","S.S. William A. Irvin Ore Boat Museum, Duluth, MN","In 1938 the S.S. William A. Irvin was launched on the Great Lakes. It is a lake freighter designed to sail throughout the Great Lakes and most particularly on Lake Superior. This ship was the flagship for the company. It was in working order until 1975. The ship was officially retired in 1978. Today the ship rests in Duluth, Minnesota as a museum. The ship is a perfect example of a straight decker, though it does not have a self unloading system. Visitors who wish to tour the ship can find their way to Canal Park and downtown Duluth. The museum is located at 350 Harbor Drive. The tour is about $9 per person.

It is all about Halloween with that tour. The Ore Boat has a capacity for 14,000 tons and a 2,000 horsepower turbine engine. Despite being an ore boat they did have staterooms for more important personnel. Some dignitaries and other wealthy riders were able to take a room on board to travel from one lake to the other. The ship was built in Lorain, Ohio by the American Ship Building Company. The ship was designed as a class four, and took 1.3 million dollars to build. The christening of the boat was for Gertrude Irvin, William Irvin's Wife. Most of the ore that was taken in the ship came from Lake Superior to the US Steel mills in Lakes Michigan and Erie. There were three other boats built in this ship's likeness, which also made the same route. During the career of this ship there was an unloading record of 13, 856 tons in 2 hours and 55 minutes. They were using the Hulett Unloaders at the time. The record as of 2007 was still unbroken, making it one of the longest records in history. The ship's specifications include 610 feet from bow to stern, with 60 feet in width. The depth of her is 32 feet 6 inches. On the tour one is able to see the immensity of the ship and how people lived on it.

"Scenic Trail Great for Hiking","Minnesota","Scenic Trail Great for Hiking","Lester Park in Duluth, Minnesota is a planned project meant to create a gathering area for the residents of the town, many of whom worked for the Lakeside Land Company. The land was set aside near the Lester River, also known by its Indian name of Busa-bika-zibi. The park is located between 60th and 61st Avenue East and Superior Street, and construction was begun on the area in 1890. The park is nearly 50 acres in size and at the time, the value of the land was just over $21,000.00. In 1888, the Lakeside Land Company donated some of the land to the U.S. government for the purpose of establishing a fish hatchery adjacent to the park. A dam was later constructed, along with a flume that carried river water to the hatchery. The hatchery is now owned by the University of Minnesota - Duluth's Limnological Society. In 1893, the first bridge was built over the Lester River. The original footbridge was washed away years before, and this structure was complete in its place. Shortly after its construction, the bridge was a popular destination for picnics, and tables were placed near the bottom while the upper area was used as a viewing platform and for relaxing. Over the years the bridge was worn down by the elements and was completely removed from the park in 1931 due to safety issues. There are still postcard pictures available for purchase of the popular bridge, as well as pictures of visitors swimming at the park and enjoying the hatchery. One of the most popular times a year at the park were the Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend holidays. To celebrate the beginning and end of summer, people would flock to the area by carriage and automobile. The Lester Park Pavilion was a popular destination and featured refreshments, a dance area, ball fields, and a merry-go-round. The park also hosted events like fireworks displays, sack races, and pie eating contests. The amusement area was a popular attraction until the mid-1900's when it was destroyed by fire. Those who would like to experience today's Lester Park and Trail are in for quite a hiking experience. You can still dine at the picnic tables, and cook on the grills provided by the park. There are softball diamonds, sand boxes, and a walking trail. The newer bridge, located at the lower end of the parking lot, is the best place to begin a hike. The area is marked, so you can follow signs that will lead you to the Lester River and the concrete dam. The trails take you across footbridges, exposed rock, creek beds, volcanic rock land, the old popular swimming holes like The Deeps, and areas in which proof of the Ice Age is visible. The trail also winds through forested areas where you can see speckled alder trees, willows, pines, and dogwoods. Watch out for wildlife in the area like deer, moose, and rabbits. You may want to take along your camera on the hike if you want to capture photos of these woodland creatures. The Lester Park in Duluth is a simple area, not filled with excitement or attractions, and it is no longer an amusement hotspot. But if you are looking for an area where you can picnic with your family or enjoy an afternoon hike, Lester Park is it."

The first building was at the home of the St. Paul Auditorium on Fourth Street. Scientific specimens and other collections were brought to a talk. Finally in 1907 the group had enough exhibits and support to incorporate beginning the St. Paul Academy of Natural Sciences.

The museum opens 10am to 5pm Monday to Saturday and 12 noon to 5pm on Sundays and is free to enter. It remains closed New Year's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The Spam Museum is dedicated to the meat first created at Hormel Foods Corporation in 1937 and features 16,500 square feet of artifacts and history. Jay Hormel organized a competition to find a name for his product and the winning entry from Kenneth Daigneau came up with the name Spam. It is eaten all over the world with over 7 billion cans having been sold since 1937, and 100 million cans are sold every year in the United States alone. Hormel Foods also makes other food products and is headquartered in Austin, so in 1991 the company opened a small storefront company museum in a local mall. Curiously though the visitors to this museum were mainly interested in Spam, and as a result the company quickly rechristened it the Spam Museum. In 2002 Hormel opened an expansive new Spam museum in its own custom building, right across the street from the meat plant, where a guide shows visitors around explaining the Spam making process. Spam is made of pork, ham, salt, water, potato, starch, sugar and sodium nitrite and was an important source of food for soldiers during the Second World War. This war effort is illustrated in one of the exhibits at the museum, where visitors will also be able to try the Spam quiz as well as view various other exhibits. There is also a Cyber Diner to surf the net and join the fan club as well as find Spam recipes. Visitors can also view short videos about the product as well as see some vintage advertising and memorabilia. There is also a chance to help with the canning process on a mock assembly line, while learning about the different varieties including the hard to find ones. Group tours of the museum can be arranged too although it is will be necessary to book these in advance. One of the attractions at the museum is called Chez Spam, which is a small amphitheater that hosts live cooking demonstrations. Global Spam has a big blinking map to show where in the world the meat is consumed, while The Garb and Guards exhibit shows the equipment and attire worn over the years of Spam making. Fans of Spam can purchase various branded gifts and souvenirs such as caps and hats, umbrellas, baseballs, blankets and many other items. A related attraction in the area is the J.C Hormel Nature Center, which is named after the Spam founder and features over 10 miles of walking trails through prairies, wetlands and forests.

The mountain provides a top elevation of 1,320 feet and a base elevation of 620 feet. The skiable area is 175 acres with 22 runs. The longest run is 5,400 feet. The ski area was founded by the City of Duluth in 1974. Many supporters like Mayor Ben Boo, Olympian George Hovland and Manley Goldfine helped get the ski area created. The mayor supported the idea in the hopes of bringing more revenue to Duluth and it has since it was opened. The construction of I-35 also helped the ski area become popular since it was a much needed road to reach Spirit Mountain. Spirit Mountain is considered the second tallest ski hill in Minnesota with 700 feet in vertical elevation. Spirit Mountain is also known as the largest terrain park in this section of the United States. The park has jumps that range from 15 feet to over 60 feet. There is a halfpipe, numerous rails, boxes, and other jibs. The lift system contains 5 chairs, 1 ski carpet, 1 handle tow, and 1 rope tow. They can make snow if the snowfall during the season is not heavy enough. They also have night skiing with plenty of lights to make sure the runs are safe. The resort and ski area provides cross country as well as downhill runs. The cross country map is quite extensive with plenty of loops and one very long trail around the ski mountain. Rates will vary each ski season, but one can expect adults to be $25 to $47 depending on nights, 4 hours, 8 hours, or the gold membership. Children range from $15 to $37 for the same type of packages. The night package is the less expensive since there are not as many hours to ski. A half day for peak times is $37 for adults. There are also discounted rates for certain times of the year. If a family is skiing a family package provides plenty of time on the lifts. Rentals, lessons, and lodging are all available as part of packages and a stay on Spirit Mountain. When winter is over Spirit Mountain is not closed down and left unattended. Instead Spirit Mountain turns into a hiking area for summer guests. The ski lifts can also work in summer for certain programs and fun throughout the season. The trails around Spirit Mountain are easy to difficult depending on what the visitor chooses. The main highway will bring visitors to Spirit Mountain, but there is also one other option. Skyline Parkway is a scenic drive through Duluth and up the coast. From the drive one can reach Spirit Mountain, as well as see it. It is a picturesque view, and one might wish to take a hike just to see the valley below near the rivers and Lake Superior that the Skyline Parkway follows. In autumn the leaves on the trees will also make the mountain a sight to behold."
"Split Rock Lighthouse","Minnesota","Split Rock Lighthouse - Two Harbors, Minnesota - Lighthouse and Historic Buildings","Split Rock Lighthouse is located at Split Rock Lighthouse Road near Two Harbors, Minnesota. It is open daily from 10am to 6pm between mid May and mid October, whilst for the remainder of the year the lighthouse and historic buildings remain closed. Visitors can find the lighthouse by driving 20 miles northeast of Two Harbors on Highway 61 with parking free during opening hours. The lighthouse was built in the wake of a mighty gale in 1905, resulting in 29 shipwrecks off Lake Superior's North Shore and construction was completed in 1910. It remained in operation until 1969 when modern navigational equipment made it obsolete. The Minnesota Historical Society carries out the goals of preservation and interpretation of Split Rock Light Station for the many visitors who come here. There are four historic building open to visitors, which are the lighthouse, fog signal building, oil house and the keeper's restored home. Visitors can either tour the lighthouse on their own or take one of the 45 minute guided tours, which leave from the visitor center at the top of the hour. Costumed guides in the lighthouse and the keeper's home recreate what life was like for the keepers and their families back in the early 1920s. Visitors can take a quarter of a mile hiking trail to the lakeshore at the bottom of the cliff to get fabulous photos of the lighthouse on top of the 130-foot cliff, as well as close up views of Lake Superior. Here visitors can also indulge in a spot of ship watching and wildlife viewing or tackle one of the other nearby trails such as the paved Gitchi-Gami State Trail or the Superior Hiking Trail. The historic site is surrounded by Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, which has a picnic area, trail center, campsites as well as 14 miles of hiking, biking, snowshoe and cross country ski trails along the shoreline of the lake and through the northern forest. There are lots of things for children to do here with various interactive exhibits and hands on activities. Educational programs are offered here too for students with information about lighthouses, navigation, iron mining, commerce, Minnesota's North Shore and Lake Superior. The site will be able to accommodate all age groups for these field trips. Although the lighthouse and historic building are closed during the winter, people can still walk around the grounds and stop at the Visitor Center and Museum Store, which open 11am to 4pm Thursday to Monday.

"St. Anthony Falls was the only natural waterfall on the Upper Mississippi River","Minnesota","St. Anthony Falls was the only natural waterfall on the Upper Mississippi River","St. Anthony Falls is located northeast of downtown Minneapolis and was the only natural waterfall on the Upper Mississippi River. The falls were replaced by a concrete overflow spillway after part of the falls collapsed in 1869. Due to a series of dams and locks being constructed in the 1950s and 1960s to extend navigation the falls are known today as Lower Saint Anthony Falls and refers to a downstream lock, which is referred to as Upper Saint Anthony Falls. The falls were named after the Catholic saint Anthony of Padua, the falls were the birthplace of former city St. Anthony and Minneapolis when the two cities joined in 1872. The cities joined to utilize the economic power of milling operations. Geologists believe that the falls appeared around 10,000 years ago downstream at the confluence of the Glacial River Warren - Ft. Snelling. They believe that the falls were around 180 feet high and have moved upstream over the centuries, breaking off chunks of limestone cap as it receded. The geological formation of the area was a thin layer of Platteville Formation, carbonate rock, which overlays the St. Peter Sandstone surface. The churning waters at the bottom of the falls have eaten away at the sandstone resulting in large blocks of Platteville formation falling off. The falls became a source of power for several industries including sawmills, textile mills and flour mills. Due to Millers creating a consortium on the Minneapolis side and diverting water into a waterwheel equipped vertical shaft then through horizontal tunnels, caused the falls upriver erosion to accelerate and almost lost the edge of their limestone cap. The upper limit of commercial navigation was at St. Anthony Falls until the dams and series of locks were built between 1948 and 1963. This made commercial navigation possible along the length of the Mississippi River. The falls are now known as upper St. Anthony Fall's dam, which is a horseshoe-shaped hydro-electric dam, which is 93 feet high and was completed in 1963 and the lower St. Anthony Falls dam, which is a gravity-type hydro-electric dam. that is 60 feet high and was complete in 1956. The current around the spillway/falls can be quite swift and dangerous. A small boat that could drift to close could have catastrophic consequences such as in 1991 when two people were killed and two other rescued by helicopter when their boat fell over one part of the dam. The falls are the only major waterfall on the Mississippi River, but the city of Minneapolis used the water resource to create power rather then as a form of transportation like most other cities developed around water. The falls were instrumental in developing Minneapolis through providing natural beauty, provided power to the lumber and flour industries and electrical power for industrial and residential use. The falls and the area surrounding them were added on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District and include 8th Avenue Northeast downstream to 6th Avenue Southeast and two city blocks on both shorelines."
"St. Croix River","Minnesota","St. Croix River, Saint Paul, MN","Minnesota is named the Land of a Thousand Lakes,'' and is perhaps the state with the most water within its borders. Part of Minnesota has the Mississippi River running through it, as well as the St. Croix River. The St. Croix River is in fact a tributary of the Mississippi River. The river runs 164 miles from Wisconsin to Minnesota, with 123 miles on the state line. It is one of the National Scenic River's that has the protection of the National Park Service. Minnesotans believe in conservation, but also use the water for a hydroelectric plant which supplies Minneapolis- Saint Paul with power. St. Croix River begins in Wisconsin moving out of Wisconsin's Upper St. Croix Lake in Douglas County. It is located near Solon Springs and is 20 miles from Lake Superior. The river flows south to Gordon before moving in a southwest direction. It is joined by Namekagon River allowing St. Croix River to widen in this area for several miles before meeting the boundary between the states. For another 130 miles it continues through Minnesota before it meets and becomes part of the Mississippi River. It is just one of the many tributaries that move about in Minnesota. Other tributaries are Kettle, Snake, Sunrise, Apple, Willow, and Kinnickinnic Rivers. In Stillwater, Minnesota the river will widen until it becomes Lake St. Croix. This is again before the tributary makes it into the Mississippi River at Prescott. This is 20 miles south east of St. Paul. There are only eight rivers that were placed under protection in 1964 by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. St. Croix River was one of the original to be added to this list. The upper river to the St. Croix Flowage, and downstream 15 miles from the source are protected under the act. The Namekagon River is also part of the St. Croix National Scenic River-way. Another section of the river protected is the Lower St. Croix section with the Dalles of the St. Croix, Interstate Park, and South of St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin. The river is historically significant, as well as a resource for Saint Paul. It was used by the American Indian tribes for trading and growing wild rice. They used to fish and catch game along the banks. The most notable tribes to use the River were the Ojibwe and Dakota. Fur trading became another important feature of the river. The first Europeans in the area were the Sieur du Lhut and his men. Fur traders spent 80 years hunting beaver pelts and other trappings. St. Croix River was part of a treaty signed in 1837 by the US and the Ojibwe tribe. In the treaty the government was able to use land in Wisconsin to log and send the logs down through the river to reach the mill. For visitors to Saint Paul a trip along the St. Croix River section in the city can be a scenic and historical driver to take."
"Stone Arch Bridge is known for graceful arches and views","Minnesota","Stone Arch Bridge is known for graceful arches and views","The Stone Arch Bridge in Minneapolis is famous for the graceful arches and breathtaking views, which has defined the skyline of the city. The bridge was built in 1883 by James J. Hill who was a railroad baron, to allow for more goods and persons to be transported across the Mississippi River. The bridge spans St. Anthony Falls and was used as a working railroad bridge until 1965. Today the bridge is used by pedestrians, bikers and the River City Trolley. The bridge was used to bring the wheat from Red River valley and Canada to the Minneapolis mills and was known as the Manitoba Line. A plaque is located near the bridge explaining its purpose at the time. Today the bridge is an icon of Minneapolis and the vital role that the Mississippi River has in the social and economic times of the regions. The bridge is made from granite and limestone, is 2,176 feet long, 28 feet across and has 23 arches. It is the only bridge of its type to be built over the Mississippi River and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District in 1971. The bridge disappears from the Minneapolis Skyline of an evening, the City of Minneapolis and private partners are working to change this. Once the funds have been raised the bridge will be permanently lit, this will be done decoratively to highlight the bridge by lighting the undersides of the arches and truss, which run across the navigation channel. Construction works have been done to the bridge in previous years in an effort to restore the bridge. This includes during the construction of the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock in 1963 when two arches needing to be replaced with 200-foot long truss to span the navigation channel to allow barges through the locks. Due to a flood in 1965 three of the piers caused the bridge to sag required repair work to strengthen the piers. In 1994 the bridge was reported in preparation for recreational use. This was done through a partnership of public agencies that raised $2.8 million to do the extensive work such as repair and stabilize the structure, a new surface, railing and light fixtures. The bike and walking trails across the bridge are part of the trails in the city park and trail system and form part of the St. Anthony Falls Heritage Trail, interpretive plaques are located along the trail to detail the history of the area. Numerous festivals are held in the area and the bridge is a focus on many of these. Fireworks displays during 4th of July celebrations launched from the bridge and also during the Minneapolis Aquatennial."
"Summit Avenue","Minnesota","Summit Avenue, Saint Paul, MN","In each city there is always a Main Street that has the town's most important places to see. For Saint Paul, Minnesota there are plenty of places of interest, but most of them are located on Summit Avenue. Summit Avenue is one of the most historic streets with houses, churches, schools, and synagogues. The street begins in the west of Saint Paul and works its way to the Mississippi River about four and a half miles. Summit Avenue is known for its character, but more than that its preservation. Those who own buildings or the historical society which owns a few of the buildings strive to keep them in great shape. One of the best examples is Victorian residential boulevard with a number of Victorian Homes near Summit Avenue. The avenue offers two National Historic Districts and two Heritage Preservation Districts. The national districts are Historical Hill which works from Lexington Avenue, Portland Avenue, Dale Street North, Marshall, Pleasant Street, and Grand Avenue. The second is the West Summit Avenue Historic District. Oxford Street to the Mississippi makes up this section of Summit Avenue. Summit Hill and Crocus Hill are the two names for these historical districts. Ramsey Hill which is from Interstate 94 to the Cathedral of Saint Paul is a district of houses built between 1890 and 1920. Many of the buildings one can see while traveling down the road were started in 1887 and up. There are multiple architectural designs in the houses with Colonial Revival, Classical, Bungalow, and Victorian. The history of Summit Avenue dates back prior to the buildings and houses. The street was created in the 1850's when Saint Paul was still a baby city. A few mansions were built on the street as early as 1859 like Edward Duffield Neils home, which was replaced by James J Hill House. The Hill Mansion is the most notable structure on Summit Avenue. It took a little less than a million dollars to create the home, which was turned over to the Catholic Archdioceses before it became a historical society property. The Civil War helped grow Summit Avenue as water service, a cable car line, and other important amenities began to crop up in the city. Unfortunately the district declined in the 1930's with the depression, which is one reason some of the old mansions were vacant or became rooming houses. For anyone visiting Saint Paul there are plenty of places to stop by like the Cathedral of Saint Paul. Other tourist attractions on Summit Avenue include Burbank Livingston Griggs House, F. Scott Fitzgerald House, William Mitchell College of Law, Minnesota Governor's Residence, Pierce and Walter Butler House. Also on the street include Macalester College, University of St. Thomas, Dr. Ward Beebe House, Saint Paul Seminary, and Frank B. Kellogg House. Visitors to Saint Paul should see a few of the mansions that still stand on Summit Avenue as well as a couple of the colleges to get a true feel of Saint Paul's character."
"Target Center","Minnesota","Target Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota","Year round entertainment can be found at the Target Center Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

"The Classic at Madden's Resort","Minnesota","The Classic at Madden's Resort, Brainerd, Minnesota ? An Upscale Championship Golf Course Just North of Minneapolis","As the story goes, the Madden's on Gull Lake resort already had 45 holes of exceptional golf when the owners decided they wanted to add a championship course. They turned to their own golf course superintendant, Scott Hoffman, to take on the layout and create the type of course that professional golfers experience every week on tour. The result was The Classic, which opened for play in 1997. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,109 yards from the Championship tees, with a USGA rating of 75.3 and a slope rating of 139 on Bent grass. The course is situated on terrain that rolls up and down in long, sweeping knolls, with elevation changes of up to 60 feet. The course also features some dramatic woodlands scenery, dominated by Red Oaks and Maples. The course also features more than 50 sand traps, but the predominant hazard is water, which comes into play on 15 of the 18 holes. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, a short par-4 Cape-style'' hole that plays along Bass Lake. Because the hole only plays to 285 yards from the White tees, daring golfers can try to cut the water and drive the green. From the tips, that requires a carry of 240 yards over water, so a shot to the landing area is the safer play. From there, the approach shot plays to a green surrounded by water on three sides, and it's not uncommon for winds off the lake to affect ball flight. Hole No. 6 is a par-5 that provides a number of challenges. The hole plays to 525 yards from the Blue tees, but it's the two giant Norway Pines splitting the fairway that will cause the first difficulty. They stand about 230 yards from the tee, but water cuts across the fairway just beyond, so driving over them is a somewhat risky option. From there, the second shot must carry the water and find a landing area that gets narrower closer to the green. Then, approach shots must find the right perch on a green that slopes severely from back to front. One of the best par-3s on the course is No. 7, which plays to 214 yards from the tips, but only 155 yards from the White tees. The hole as open feeling and some beautiful scenery, as well as the challenge of water all along the right and water that also cut through the landing area short of the green. Trees provide the backdrop, while three sand bunkers guard the green on any shots that go long. The Classic has garnered a number of honors and accolades, including being ranked #3 in the U.S. and Canada for Best New Upscale Public Courses by Golf Digest in 1997. The course was also selected as a Favorite Place to Golf by MN Monthly magazine. Practice facilities at The Classic include a full-size driving range, a practice putting and chipping green, as well as as nine-hole short-game course. Madden's also features a spacious clubhouse, and offers three full-service restaurants as well as four casual eating areas. Other activities at Madden's include swimming at sand beaches or pools, tennis, croquet, lawnbowling, shuffleboard, horseshoes, volleyball, badminton, basketball, and bike rentals.

"The Dutch Legacy Golf Course at Cragan's","Minnesota","The Dutch Legacy Golf Course at Cragan's, Brainer, Minnesota - A 5-Star-Rated Golf Course in Minnesota's Gull Lake Area","The Dutch Legacy golf course is one of three Legacy golf courses at Cragun's Resort on Gull Lake. The Legacy Course is a Robert Trent Jones, Jr. design that is built in and around the existing wetlands between Gull Lake and Stephen's Lake. As such, the course features many carries over wetlands, as well as shots along the lake, to go with traditional bunkering and course design. The 18-hole, par-72 Dutch Legacy course plays to 6,879 yards, with a USGA rating of 74.0 and a slope rating of 145. Many of the holes feature tree-lined fairways to add to the challenge, but the greens tend to be large and built to be more receptive to long-iron shots often required by the layout. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, a short par-4 that plays to only 318 yards off the Blue tees and under 300 yards from the Whites. This hole doglegs right around Stephen's Lake, while trees guard the left side of the fairway. The fairway narrows dramatically as it approaches the green, where a bottleneck formed by two long sand bunkers will collect any shots short of the putting surface. Hole No. 6 is a short par-3 - for everyone except the pros, that it. From the back tees, this hole plays to 239 yards, but only 143 from the Blues. The challenge on this hole comes from the marshland that surrounds the green, calling for a carry off the tee. The green is nestled among trees and guarded further by bunkers left and right. Hole No. 8 is the shortest on the course, but was described by designer Jones as a land mine hole.'' The challenge comes from the six bunkers that guard the left and right front of the green, as well as a putting surface that can be extremely challenging due to its undulations. Hole No. 13 is a short par-5 at only 480 yards from the Blue tees, yet it is one of the more challenging holes on the course. The problem is finding the fairway as the hole doglegs left twice around wetlands. Cutting the corner off the tee means not only carrying the wetlands, but also clearing the tall trees along the way. From there the fairway narrows to about the width of a cart path right before the green, as the wetland push in from the left side. The green is a large one, but a large bunker guards the left while trees frame the back and right. Hole No. 16 is another fairly short par-5 with one of the most interesting fairways golfers will encounter. Shaped like the letter c,'' the fairway provides golfers with an interesting choice off the tee: play safely around the outside of the c-shape toward the hole, or go to the right and try to carry the wetlands on the second shot to reach the green in two.

"The Legend at Giants Ridge","Minnesota","The Legend at Giants Ridge, Biwabik, Minnesota - Traditional Northwoods Golf and a Prestigious 4 1/2-Star Rating from Golf Digest","The Legend is one of the two highly-rated golf courses at Giants Ridge resort, along with The Quarry. Carved out of Minnesota's Superior National Forest, The Legend is considered traditional Minnesota golf set amid the state's picturesque northwoods terrain. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,930 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 74.3 and a slope rating of 138 on Bent grass. Of the two courses, The Legend is considered the more friendly resort'' course, and features tree-lined fairways punctuated by white-sand bunkers, boulders, deep ravines, and sparkling lakes. The course features many signature'' holes that have been described as breathtaking. Hole No. 3 has a particularly distinctive feature - a fairway sand bunker that is shaped like a huge giant's foot, complete with five toes. This par-5 dogleg left plays to 501 yards from the back tees, so reaching the green in two is a possibility, especially from the more forward tees. Hole No. 11 is one of the most picturesque holes on the course, a par-3 with a green surrounded by water. The hole plays to 157 yards at the tips from a slightly elevated tee, so length is not the issue. The green is guarded by a large bunker on the left, however, and juts out into the water on the right and slopes toward it, making something to the left the safer play. In general, the back nine on The Legend is considered the more scenic, and has been described by golfers as playing through old logging trails.'' Hole No. 14 certainly fits that description, as this par-5, 510-yard hole plays through woods, a number of fairway bunkers and around outcroppings of rocks and boulders. Hole No. 17 is another picturesque par-3, and has been described as one of the best par-3s in the state and the country. It is also one of the most challenging holes on the course, playing to a lengthy 226 yards from the back tees, and a still-demanding 183 yards from the White tees. This is one of those all-or-nothing holes that's all carry over a lake to a green nestled amid trees on the opposite shoreline. There's a bunker at the back of the green, which is elevated and slopes toward the water on any shots that fall short or to the left. Since opening the course has received a number of honors and awards, including a 4?-Star rating from Golf Digest five years in a row. That same publication also named The Legend the #1 Public Golf Course in the state in 1999. Practice facilities at The Legend include a driving range, short-game area and putting green.

"The Pines at Grand View Lodge, Lakes/Woods Course, Nisswa, Minnesota 27 Holes of Championship Golf in a Traditional Northwoods Venue","Minnesota","The Pines at Grand View Lodge, Lakes/Woods Course, Nisswa, Minnesota 27 Holes of Championship Golf in a Traditional Northwoods Venue","The Grand View Lodge has been known as a resort/vacation destination in the Gull Lake area in central Minnesota since the early 1900s. It has since jumped on the golf bandwagon during the last decade or so, helping to fuel the golf boom in Minnesota's Brainerd Lakes region. The resort is home the three championship golf courses, including The Pines, which offers 27 holes of golf and three distinct nine-hole combinations. The Lakes-Woods combination is considered the best of the three combinations, and plays to 6,874 yards from the Championship tees, with a USGA rating of 74.2 and a slope rating of 137. From the White tees, the course plays to 6,152 yards. As the names suggest, the Lakes and Woods nines offer distinctly different features and personalities, bringing either water or tree-lined fairways into play, while offering a typical Minnesota-Northwoods golfing experience. Some of the most noteworthy holes include the No. 7 hole on The Lakes nine. This par-3 is a favorite of golfers, and one of the most scenic holes on the course. The hole plays to only 152 yards from the back tees, but the challenge comes right off the tee as golfers stare down the length of a water hazard that runs to the green. There's also brush and a tall tree to the left of the water as it narrows toward a slightly elevated green. Anything to the left will run down a steep bank to the hazard, so the best play is to the middle-right of a long, narrow green. Hole No. 9 on The Lakes courses is another challenging par-3 that plays to a lengthy 212 yards from the back tees. What makes this hole even more challenging is its narrow green with three tiers that makes finding the right distance off the tee especially important to have any hope of a good score. The Pines was the first of the Grand View Lodge's three championship golf courses to open, and it's received a good deal of acclaim over the years. In 1998, GOLF Magazine rated the course #1 in Minnesota, and Golf Digest gave the course its prestigious 5-Star rating on its Places to Play list for 2002-2003. Practice facilities include a driving range with grass hitting surface, as well as short-game practice area with a sand bunker. A variety of golf instruction options are also available. The resort also features a spacious, full-service clubhouse designed to resemble a Cedar-log cabin. The clubhouse is home to a golf pro shop, as well as Freddy's Tavern, a casual, full-service restaurant. Lodging is also available, and other amenities include 11 tennis courts, a 300-person swimming pool with a 110-foot water slide, and a beach on Gull Lake.  The Paul Bunyan Trail is one of the nation's longest paved trails, where guests can hike, bike or rollerblade."
"The Quarry at Giants Ridge","Minnesota","The Quarry at Giants Ridge, Biwabik, Minnesota ? Cited by Golf Digest as ``The Best Golf of the 21st Century''","The Quarry Golf Course at Giants Ridge resort is sculpted from equal parts of the north woods of Minnesota and rugged, reclaimed minelands and a sand quarry/gravel-mining operation. The course also features wetlands, forests, deep hazards, and some dramatically elevated tees. According to course architect Jeff Brauer, who designed both The Legend and The Quarry courses at Giants Ridge, The Quarry is the most `unnatural' and, because of its ruggedness, it was easy to distinguish it with rugged features. While The Legend was carved out of the North Woods at the corner of Superior National Forest, The Quarry is distinctly different with rock quarries and barren land from a century old sand and gravel mining operation.'' The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2003, plays to 7,201 yards from the back tees, but only 6,101 from the Whites. The Quarry'' name pays tribute to the region's industrial past, and each hole on the course is named for area mines. Some of the more noteworthy holes on the course include No. 2, which is a stunning and challenging par-5 that plays to 575 yards from the back tees. The tee shot is relatively easy to a wide fairway, but from there things get interesting. Looming directly ahead are bunkers and sand dunes surrounding a 25-foot-deep waste area that must be carried on the second shot. Approach shots must take aim at a long, narrow green that features distinct tiers. One of the more difficult holes on the course is No. 4, a par-3 that plays to a hefty 269 yards from the back tee and 188 from the Whites. The hole plays downhill, but if the wind is blowing in, golfers may find themselves with driver in hand. The view of this hole is very scenic and will have golfers reminded of the famous Redan hole at North Berwick in Scotland. Hole No. 10 is another scenic beauty, a short par-4 that calls for some decisions. The best shot off the tee calls for a carry over a long pond, while the safer shot to the right may find a large landing area but a tougher angle to the slightly elevated green that's guarded by a steep bank of native grasses. No. 17 has been described as breathtaking, another long par-3 that plays to 220 yards from the back tee, with water along the left and woods guarding the right. There's a small landing area short of the green on the right, but for the most part this hole is all carry. The Quarry has been garnering some rave reviews since opening, including this from Golf Digest critic Ron Whitten who cited The Quarry as The Best Golf of the 21st Century.'' He went on to say, It's a combination of Pebble Beach, Pine Valley, Merion and Tobacco Road, with a bit of architectural Tabasco Sauce sprinkled in for the occasional jolt.'' Practice facilities at The Quarry include a driving range, short-game area and putting green. There's also a pro shop and lessons are available. Lodging is available at The Lodge at Giants Ridge and the Villas at Giants Ridge. Dining is available at the Wacootah Grille and the Timbers Restaurant & Sticks Lounge located in The Lodge."

"The Wilderness at Fortune Bay","Minnesota","The Wilderness at Fortune Bay, Tower, Minnesota - One of the Best New Upscale Golf Courses in Minnesota","The Wilderness Golf Course is part of the Fortune Bay Resort Casino, located a few hours north of the Twin Cities. The course is situated atop high granite ridges, amid woodlands of white and red pines and thick evergreens, and around the picturesque shores of Lake Vermillion and the land surrounding Fortune Bay. There are also five ponds on the course and six holes bring water into play. The 18-hole, par-72 course, which opened in 2004, was designed by Jeff Brauer and plays to a lengthy 7,207 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 75.3 and a slope rating of 144 on Bent grass. From the Blue and White tees, the course play to 6,772 and 6,147 yards respectively. Many of the holes are located on a high granite ridge, making for stunning views of Lake Vermilion and the surrounding woodlands. The course also features many boulders throughout, some of them chest-high, as well jagged outcroppings of granite, the occasional big log, multi-fingered sand traps, and knee-high grasses. It's not uncommon to find some of these hazards splitting a fairway in two, making golfers choose carefully their route to the hole, where the greens tend to be big and undulating and often feature multiple tiers. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 2, a long and challenging par-4 that's also quite picturesque. With the tee boxes located atop a granite ridge, the view of the fairway and the green is stunning. The left side of the fairway is defined by a large, white outcropping of ledge rock, while the right side is bounded by cedar and spruce trees, creating a Northwoods'' flavor. Hole No. 5 is a short par-4 that sits atop the highest point on the course. From the high elevation, golfers will see Lake Vermilion in the distance, as well as their path to a green that features a five-foot-deep swale through its center. Hole No. 13 is the signature hole at The Wilderness, and is another short par-4 that plays to only 340 yards from the longest tees. This is the only hole located along the shores of Lake Vermilion, and it provides another picturesque and challenging hole with a carry over the water. One feature that is particularly pleasing to golfers is the GPS system and elaborate onboard computer screen found on golf carts. The system can tell golfers the exact distance to the pin, yardage to the front and back of the green, distance required to carry a hazard, and so on. It will even pinpoint the position of the other carts on the course, which is handy for knowing if the group ahead has moved safely out of the way.

She sailed the Great Lakes region without unpleasant incident for four decades before her retirement. This massive artifact was retired from active service in at the end of 1978 shipping season. Although still capable of sailing the waters of Gitche Gumee trade and industry advancements resulted in her retirement. In light of the development of faster, longer ships with greater cargo capacity the Irvin was deemed obsolete in the shipping industry. Even so, the Irvin still holds the record time for unloading nearly fourteen thousand tons of ore in just less than 3 hours. This feat was astounding given the absence of modern day cargo unloading technology. The Irvin was never considered for the scrap heap as often occurs with retired cargo vessels. Due to her prominence as a onetime flagship the Irvin now proudly stands as an important symbol of the shipping industry's past. Whether visitors to Duluth venture on board for the informative, they'll marvel at the massive appearance of the grand ship. So go aboard this spectacular museum and get a real look at shipping life. The ship is open for tours starting Memorial Day and continuing through the first part of October. October weekends are especially entertaining when the staff conducts haunted ship tours through the many corridors of the ships interior. Don't forget to stop by the gift shop and pick up a souvenir to home. The S.S. William A. Irvin gift shop features a large variety of nautical and collectible items."

"Wabasha Street Caves","Minnesota","Wabasha Street Caves, Saint Paul, MN","History, haunting, and cave dangers make up the three things visitors will find at Wabasha Street Caves in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Unlike most cave tours, Wabasha has a character of its own. An event hall was built into the sandstone caves which run along the south shore of the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul. The caves were actually manufactured by mining rather than nature, but they have a long history. The caves were homes for mobsters, speakeasies, and even events like Swing Night.'' Swing Night is hosted in the event hall on Thursday nights with live band music and plenty of space for dancing. As part of the event hall there are tours of the original sandstone caves in Saint Paul and those out in Stillwater. The first cave'' was built in the 1840's when locals began mining for minerals. During the 1920's when the mines were no longer in use a restaurant and nightclub was built into the front of the cave. It was known as the Wabasha Street Speakeasy. John Dillinger and Ma Barker were two gangsters that were said to have visited the Speakeasy, though this is more legend than evidentiary fact. Over the next several years the caves were used for growing mushrooms, storing food, belongings, and as places for music and dancing. In 1933 Josie and William Lehmann opened the Castle Royal which was built to the side of the cave entrances. Unfortunately, this establishment closed soon after due to the start of World War II. In the 70's a Castle Royal 2 was opened for disco music. Some of the items stored in the caves can still be seen today on the cave tours. Cave tours are 45 minutes for $6 for adults and $5 for children or students. Anyone under 5 is free. Tours begin on Thursday at 5pm, Saturday and Sunday at 11am year round. The Saint Paul Gangster Tours go over the legends of John Dillinger and Ma Barker coming to the caves. This tour is 2 hours starting noon on Saturdays. The tour is $23.50.

A young boy was said to have seen some of the gangsters that frequented the place. The caves can be dangerous because of obstacles and mine shafts, which is why tour guides are necessary."

"White Bear Yacht Club","Minnesota","White Bear Yacht Club, White Bear Lake, Minnesota ? A Classical Donald Ross-Designed Golf Course from the Early 1900s","The White Bear golf course is a Donald Ross layout that first opened in 1920 as part of the White Bear Yacht Club facility in Minnesota, which was originally founded in 1889. As such, it's listed by the USGA as one of the first 100 clubs established in the county, and both the club and the course have a rich and storied history. The club is said to have hosted such notable guests as F. Scott Fitzgerald and wife Zelda in the summer of 1921. The club is located 20 miles northeast of St. Paul and is built on the area's gently rolling hills, providing some dramatic movement throughout the design. Numerous trees line the fairways, and the course also incorporates some links-style elements, such as bunkers punctuated by grassy mounds and rolling terrain that rarely allows for a flat lie. The greens tend to provide the most challenge by playing fast with many slopes and subtle breaks. The course is considered one of the most interesting in the state, and it's been said to have some of the best Donald Ross holes ever seen. Over the years, the course has undergone many changes, including a restoration in the 1990s. The fairways were also widened from the original 20-25 yard avenues to the current 40-60 yards. The bunkers and greens were both reworked, however, adding to the difficulty to compensate for the more generous fairways. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to a short 6,471 yards from the Championship tees, with a USGA rating of 72.5 and a slope rating of 137. Accuracy, rather than length, is the key at this layout, as well as shot-making while standing on uneven terrain. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 1, which is not the typically friendly Donald Ross opening hole. Instead, this par-4 plays to 405 yards with an abruptly uphill driving area. For most players that leaves a second shot of 150-175 yards off a steep uphill lie. The green sits atop an elevated perch, and any approach shots that fall short of the putting surface will roll back down the slope, leaving players with an uphill pitch to a sloping green. The par-3s on the front nine are also considered excellent holes, with both the No. 3 and No. 6 holes both playing downhill and demanding that tee shots find the green to have any hope of a good score. Over the years, White Bear golf course has received much acclaim. In 1995-96, Golf Digest rated the course as the 5th best in the state, while Golfweek magazine ranked the course #86 among Anmerica's 100 Best Classical Courses in 1998, then #70 for 1999. Perhaps even more impressive is the clubhouse, which was rebuilt in 1999 and is said to offer some of the best lake views in the Twin Cities, as well as some of the best dining. Other activities at the private athletic and social club include yachting, tennis, swimming and other sports."
