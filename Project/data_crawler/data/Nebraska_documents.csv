"Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Nebraska a Fascinating Place to Explore","Nebraska","Agate Fossil Beds National Monument in Nebraska a Fascinating Place to Explore","	Located near the town of Harrison in northwestern Nebraska, Agate Fossil Beds National Monument was authorized as such in 1965 but was not officially declared a national monument until more than 30 years later in 1997. Maintained by the National Park Service, this valley of the Niobrara River is best known for its vast collection of fossils, particularly those of Miocene mammals that roamed the Earth as much as 20 million years ago. Indeed, Agate Fossil Beds National Monument is a world-renowned archaeological site and experts from the world over have come here to study the remains of such ancient animals as the Menoceras, a small rhinoceros; Miohippus, predecessor of the modern horse; Stenomylus, a camelid not unlike the South American Vicuna; Amphicyon, a bear dog; and Palaeocaster, an ancient land beaver. History shows that the original inhabitants of this land, the Lakota Sioux tribe, knew about the ancient bones, but modern scientists and archaeologists rediscovered them beginning in the 1880s. Visitors may take the Fossil Hills Trail to Carnegie and University Hills were the bones were once quarried and/or may visit various archaeological exhibits at Agate Fossil Beds National Monument's expansive Visitor Center. Both Fossil Hills Trail and Daemonelix Trail are easy trails to traverse and can be enjoyed by most everyone who can tolerate a vigorous walk. Fossil Hills is a 2.5-mile loop that crosses the Niobrara River wetlands and loops the bone bed. A one-mile side trail accessible off the Fossil Hills Trail takes visitors to the homestead of Harold Cook, used by scientists as they were sorting bones. Daemonelix Trail is a one-mile loop that allows visitors to cross ancient sand dunes and view the petrified homes of ancient land beavers who fashioned spiraled burrows. The top of the trail provides an excellent view of the property. Part of the land of which this 3,000-acre national monument sits was once the property of James H. Cook and his wife Kate. Cook's Agate Springs Ranch also became an important gathering place for Chief Red Cloud and other members of the Oglala Lakota Sioux Indian people. Here there was a sharing of cultures between Red Cloud and Cook's family and visitors can see the fruits of that relationship in an impressive display of American Indian artifacts that the Sioux gave to Cook and his wife from the 1880s through the early 1900s. Photos of Red Cloud, the most photographed 19th century American Indian, and Cook are also on display. The Visitor Center also offers a 12-minute film on the history of the Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, which provides a good introduction to the site. There's also a bookstore/gift shop on the premises. Agate Fossil Beds is in a very remote area of Nebraska and no camping facilities are located onsite. A picnic area is available near the Visitor Centers as are vending machines. Limited other amenities, such as gas stations, restaurants, and stores, are available about 20 miles from the park."

"Arbor Lodge State Historical Park","Nebraska","Arbor Lodge State Historical Park - Nebraska City, Nebraska - State Park and Mansion","Arbor Lodge State Historical Park is located at 2nd Avenue in Nebraska City, Nebraska. The park grounds are open all year round from dawn to dusk and the mansion is open from late April to late October, although between Thanksgiving and Christmas the mansion is again open to visitors to show how it is festively decorated as part of a 12 rooms of Christmas celebration. A current Nebraska Park Entry Permit is required for vehicles in the park. The park is 72 acres of wooded rolling hills featuring 250 varieties of trees and shrubs, an Italian terraced garden, a whispering bench and a tree trail. The tree trail is approximately one and a half miles long and runs through the original arboretum area planted by the Morton family, who owned the estate from when it was built in the 19th century. Trees are labeled for ease of identification as visitors walk along the wood-chipped path and rest on the cool shaded benches. The 52-room Arbor Lodge mansion was the home of J. Sterling Morton, who amongst other things was the U.S Secretary of Agriculture and was the founder of Arbor Day, which was made a legal holiday by the Nebraska Legislature in 1885 and is now celebrated in every state and 12 other countries. Built in 1855 as a four-room frame house the mansion has increased in size over time. Visitors will be able to see the authentic furnishings in the rooms, and there are displays which depict how Morton and his family lived and worked. The carriage house was built in 1901 to house the Morton's coaches, carriages and horses and still stands today for visitors to view. Displayed here are a Stanhope phaeton, a Vail phaeton, a rockaway, a sidebar runabout, the traditional surrey, and a Brougham used by President Grover Cleveland.

"ArborLinks Golf Club, Nebraska City, Nebraska - an Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course, and One of the Best Courses in Nebraska","Nebraska","ArborLinks Golf Club, Nebraska City, Nebraska - an Arnold Palmer Signature Golf Course, and One of the Best Courses in Nebraska","ArborLinks Golf Club is an Arnold Palmer Signature course located just outside of Nebraska City on the wooded hills and old cornfields of Arbor Day Farm. The course makes use of the natural character of the landscape, which includes hills, natural forest and meandering streams, as the basis for its design. The course, which opened in 2002, features a links-style layout with wide-open, rolling fairways, fast, undulating greens, and holes defined and bordered by native grasses. The course also has an old-world'' look and feel, with bunkers and other hazards sculpted toward that end. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,080 yards from the tips, with four sets of tees on each hole to accommodate various handicaps. The course takes an environmentally-friendly approach in both its design and maintenance, and even the holes sport names designed to remind golfers of the importance of the environment. Some of the most noteworthy holes include Hole No. 3, a classic example of a links-style design. Plum Thicket,'' as it's named, is a short hole, playing to only 145 yards, but the challenge comes in hitting a long, narrow green that's slightly elevated and features sloping sides guarded by large, plunging, oddly-shaped bunkers. Baldeypress Bay'' is the No. 7 hole, a par-4 that plays up to 413 yards. The challenge on this hole is hitting a narrow, sloping fairway that's guarded by a long water hazard that runs along the left. Approach shots must then find a narrow, angled green guarded by more bunkers. Planetree Place'' is the No. 12 hole, a curving dogleg right par-4 that plays up to 414 yards and plays along the largest waste bunker on the course. Approach shots must contend with another green guarded by an expansive bunker. Cottonwood Creek'' is the finishing hole on the course, a par-4 that plays up to 426 yards from the back tees. From the tee, golfers shouldn't have too much trouble finding the fairway landing area, but the approach shot to the green calls for a carry over the creek gully, which is filled with trees and tall grasses. The green is similar to others on the course - long and narrow, with hills and bunkers on the left and a down slope and bunkers on the right. Since its opening in 2002, ArborLinks has received a number of honors and awards. Golf Digest named the course a Top 10 Facility in the State of Nebraska in 2008, and one of the Top 10 Best New Affordable Public Courses in America in 2002. Practice facilities at ArborLinks include a driving range with grass teeing area and a short-game practice area. The club also features a clubhouse with dining and lodging available."
"Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park","Nebraska","Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park - Royal, Nebraska - Park and Museum Featuring Skeletons and Fossils","Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park is situated 6 miles north of U.S. Highway 20 between Royal and Orchard in Nebraska. It also stands on 360 acres of rugged rangeland in the scenic Verdigre Creek valley and was designated as a National Natural Landmark in Antelope County in 1986, the first for 18 years. Openings hours vary throughout the year so it is probably advisable for visitors to check before heading to this historic park. This is Nebraska's newest state park having opened its gates in 1991 and is a joint project of the University of Nebraska State Museum and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. At the park many skeletons of prehistoric animals have been found resting in volcanic ash underneath the rolling farmlands of northeastern Nebraska. Museum crews have been excavating well preserved fossil rhinos, horses, camels and birds, which in some cases still have bones joined together rather than just individual pieces. Visitors can follow some of the nature trails, which have been developed to improve the understanding of the area geology, as well as the plants and wildlife of today and in the past. Visitors are prohibited from collecting fossils and other specimens found on the park grounds to ensure the natural history of the area is maintained and not lost forever. The Nebraska Game and Parks Foundation purchased the land in 1986 to ensure the preservation of Ashfall, whilst the Burlington Northern Foundation supplied a grant for construction of facilities at the park. Interpretive displays and the fossil preparation laboratory enable visitors to ask the paleontologists about their work. Here there are regular educational programs presented by the experts, with school and tour groups welcome to visit Ashfall between the start of April and the middle of October. The facilities at the park are wheelchair accessible. The main attraction at the park is the 17,500 square foot Hubbard Rhino Barn, which opened in 2009 as a replacement for a smaller version. The barn holds many of the skeletons at the park, and was given its name because the most common animal located at the fossil site has been the barrel-bodied rhinoceros. It is also named after the Hubbard family of Omaha, who through their Foundation donated a $1.2 million gift to the University of Nebraska Foundation. Over 200 fossil skeletons from 12 species of Clarendonian Land Mammal Age have been discovered at Ashfall so far, and 12 of the 17 species of vertebrates found amongst the ash are mammals. Finds so far include five species of horse, three camel species, one rhino and a saber-toothed deer. Other discoveries have included a bone crushing dog, a turtle and three species of bird. Visitors to this historic site have left favorable reviews of their trip here. Many were surprised at what they found or unaware that these creatures lived in the United States. Generally the comments were that this is a fascinating place to visit if you have any interest in fossils and natural history."

"Chimney Rock National Historic Site","Nebraska","Chimney Rock National Historic Site - Bayard, Nebraska - Geological Formation","Chimney Rock National Historic Site is a geological formation and famous landmark located one and a half miles south of Highway 92 on Chimney Rock Road in Bayard, Nebraska. It is open daily from 9am to 5pm for a small admission fee, although children accompanied by adults can enter for free, as will Nebraska State Historical Society members. The attraction remains closed on all state holidays except Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day. The rock towers nearly 300 feet high above the surrounding North Platte River valley and is 4,226 feet above sea level. The unusual rock formation is the most noted on the Oregon Trail, and has come to symbolize the great voluntary migration with colonies moving in huge droves from the eastern states. In the middle of the 19th century the rock served as a landmark along the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails as it is visible for many miles along what is now U.S Route 26. The first recorded mention of Chimney Rock was in 1827 by Joshua Pilcher, who had traveled along the Platte River valley to the Salt Lake rendezvous of the Rocky Mountain fur trappers. Now the rock is a designated National Historic Site and is administered by the National Park Service and the Nebraska State Historical Society. The rock is featured on a Nebraska State Quarter released in 2006, which depicts the migration west via Chimney Rock. The Visitor Center features numerous museum exhibits that explain the westward migration of the 19th century as well as the memories of Chimney Rock of the people who traveled the trails west. Here visitors can try hands-on activities such as load the wagon,'' whilst there is also a video presentation to explain the story of the great migration West in greater detail. Original maps made from Captain John C. Fremont's 1842-43 exploration of the Oregon Trail can be found here, whilst several books on western and trail history are available for purchase at the gift shop located within the visitor center. The Load the Wagon feature at the visitor center is essentially a children's activity enabling them to decide what to take on their trip, but if they overload the wagon a red light will come on. Every now and then throughout the year various events and presentations will be staged at the visitor center. Group tours can be arranged throughout the year with special rates available, although visitors are advised to call ahead to make a reservation for their party. Past visitors to this site have given good reviews stating that it is a spectacular view, although the rock can be seen from many different places. Courthouse Rock and Jail Rock along the Oregon Trail in nearby Bridgeport are also recommended to tourists. Due to the fairly remote nature of this tourist attraction there are not too many top rated restaurants nearby, but a Mexican establishment El Charrito Restaurant & Lounge and Whiskey Creek Steakhouse are both about 22 miles away in Scottsbluff."

The hours of opening vary throughout the year but generally the attraction is open daily from 9am, except between the start of November and end of February when it opens on Friday, Saturday and Sunday only from 10am. The Great Platte River Road Archway is an interactive adventure that pays tribute to the pioneers who passed through Nebraska on their way West between 1843 and 1869. These men, women and children were hugely determined to reach their destination having to tackle mountains, rivers and valleys along the way whilst carrying their cherished belongings in wagons or strapped to burros. This interactive exhibits and shows give visitors the opportunity to experience the excitement of news coming into a distant trail, a buffalo stampede, the words and faces of those that lived and died on the route, the building of the railroad, the creation of the Lincoln Highway (America's first transcontinental road), and today's modern transportation system. The archway itself was opened in 1999 and weighs 1,500 tons with the exterior designed to resemble a Nebraska sunset. Concerned as to how the structure could cross 308 feet of a traffic heavy interstate road without causing complete traffic chaos, the constructors built the archway beside the highway and lifted it in to place. As a result a 10 hour transport of the Archway using rubber tired, self propelled modular transporters was needed to eventually get the structure in place. Sights and sounds to be seen at the archway exhibits include an entry movie and show. Visitors can also see the Oxen and Covered Wagon exhibit, Sweetwater Rescue exhibit and three automobile related exhibits including a Model T exhibit. An authentic 1914 Model T Ford and a 1927 Oldsmobile car can bee seen in the Lincoln Highway exhibit, whilst the Drive-In exhibit includes a 1961 Cadillac Convertible. Special tours are offered to school groups including an historic reenactment presented by actors and actresses from the archway. This tells the story of Eliza Donner, the challenges of the Pony Express riders, tales from an early Irish immigrant, stories from Ft. Kearny commanding officer Frank North and how the railroad came about. Scout programs are also produced here to help enrich local knowledge and learn about topics such as general American history, Indian tribes and the Civil War. Visitors can purchase souvenirs at the gift shop, which features hand-made, home-made and home-grown products from natives of the state. The Chuckwagon Restaurant has barbeques from 11am to 2pm Monday to Saturday.

"Quarry Oaks Golf Club","Nebraska","Quarry Oaks Golf Club, Ashland, Nebraska - Named the #1 Golf Course and the Most Scenic Golf Course in Nebraska","Quarry Oaks Golf Club is set amid a very hilly area in Nebraska's Platte River Valley, which is also a very heavily forested area, with an abundance of wildlife and wildflowers. Elevation changes are frequent on this course and can reach up to 75 feet, and every hole features mature trees on all sides. The course also winds through the remnants of an old rock quarry on select holes, which adds to the scenery and the challenge. The course is a John Lafoy design, which he called his Masterpiece in the Midwest.'' The course, which opened for play in 1997, features some very generous fairways, a fair number of bunkers and water hazards that come into play on several holes. The greens tend to be large, but undulating, making putting one of the top challenges on the course. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,010 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 75.1 and a slope rating of 143 on Bent grass. Some reviewers have described the course as both the most fun course they've played, but also one where you can expect to lose a lot of golf balls. Some of the most noteworthy holes include Hole No. 11. This par-3 plays to 202 yards from the Black tees, but only 156 yards from the Whites. It's also one of the most picturesque holes on the course, as well as one that can be a bit intimidating as it plays over a pond to a green that sits like a bowl amid trees and bunkers. Another noteworthy hole is No. 17, which has been said to be simply breathtaking. This par-4 is the signature hole on the course and plays to only 394 yards from the back tees, but features the largest water hazard on the course. The water comes into play at about the midpoint of the fairway, making for a challenge off the tee. The approach shot that follows can be even more daunting, as the hole and the green curve left to create a semi-island green that plays long and narrow. The finishing hole that follows is cut from the same mold. This is a long par-5 that plays to 522 yards from the back tees. The challenge is finding safety in a narrow, curving fairway with trees on the left and a long water hazard and more trees on the right. Approach shots and lay ups then play to a green with six bunkers - two short right and four surrounding the green. Since its opening, Quarry Oaks has received some high praise. Golf Digest ranked it the #1 course in Nebraska in 1999. That same publication rated the course one of America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses from 2003-2009. It was also named Most Scenic Golf Course in Nebraska by Nebraska Golfer Magazine in 2004. Practice facilities at Quarry Oaks include a driving range and short-game practice area. There's also a 10,000-square-foot clubhouse with a pro shop and both casual and more elegant dining available."

Adams Bromley Sheldon increased his sister's gift with 40 percent of his own estate and work on the Sheldon Museum of Art was eventually started in 1961.

Sod houses or `soddies' as they were also known were built on the prairies from the sod of thickly rooted prairie grass by the settlers and were forerunners to the log cabins in North America. The sod was used primarily as there weren't standard building materials such as wood or stone on the prairies. The houses were naturally very cheap to build and surprisingly well insulated but were susceptible to damp and even rain damage. The Sod House Museum is a red barn shaped authentic replica of the sod houses built by early settlers in this region and was established in 1988. The lives and working practices of the settlers is honored here with memorabilia and photographs taken during the pioneer era. The inside of the sod houses were pretty sparse reflecting the hard times experienced by the settlers who lived there. There is a wooden windmill in an old farmstead setting, life-size barbed wire sculptures of a buffalo and a Native American on horseback adding further realism to the experience here. In the front yard of the museum is one of the world's largest sod-cutting plows, which is one of the few tools the settlers brought west. The visit to the museum also features some impressive barbed-wire art including a life-size buffalo and a horse with a native American rider. Gothenburg is the hometown of former Dallas Cowboy American Football star Jay Novacek.

Part of the trip would include visits to the Heritage Center to find items relevant to the homesteading movement, and a chance for students to dress up and carry out the chores of a homesteader by way of a relay race. A 45 minute trail walk through the prairie can be arranged too with the help of a ranger."

"The Players Club at Deer Creek, Omaha, Nebraska - 27 Holes of Championship Golf, and a Signature Arnold Palmer Design","Nebraska","The Players Club at Deer Creek, Omaha, Nebraska - 27 Holes of Championship Golf, and a Signature Arnold Palmer Design","The Players Club at Deer Creek features 27 holes of championship golf, including a signature golf course designed by Arnold Palmer. The Club, which began converting from public to private in 2006, is located in northwest Omaha, yet features a lush, country-like setting of rolling hills and sprawling fairways. The Palmer Championship course was the first to be built, and the nine-hole Highlands course was added in 2000. The 18-hole, par-71 Palmer Course plays to 7,003 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 140. The two nines of this course are rather different and distinctive in nature. The front nine has a Midwestern feel, with rolling terrain, while the back nine has a Florida style that is flatter with a good deal of water and wetlands coming into play. There are also numerous bunkers to add to the challenge. The new Highlands nine mixes some of the qualities of the two original nines, with more elevation changes and more movement. Some of the more noteworthy holes include No. 3, which is indicative of the beautifully sculpted holes and the character of the front nine. This par-4 plays to only 388 yards from the longest tees, but features an undulating fairway leading to a green that is a sight to behold. While relatively flat, the green sits atop a pedestal surrounded by sprawling, gaping bunkers, with a narrow gap of grass at its front. Hole No. 6 is the #1 handicap hole on the course and offers more of the same. This par-4 plays to a length of 484 yards from the back tees, and 405 yards from the forward men's Medalist'' tees. The hole features a jagged, curving, undulating fairway with lots of movement and swales, punctuated with a few well-placed bunkers. From there it's downhill to another pedestal-like green guarded by more bunkers. On the back nine, water really comes into play on Holes 13-16, as each plays around ponds and small lakes. Hole No. 14 is a par-4 that calls for a tee shot over water to a fairway landing area, followed by an approach shot over more water to a green guarded left and right by bunkers. Hole No. 15 is similar and even more daunting. This par-5 plays to a hefty 589 yards from the back tees and 472 from the forward men's tees. Tee shots must carry water to a narrow fairway, while approach shots must contend with a green bordered by a smaller body of water on the left, and bunkers left and right. Since opening, The Players Club has garnered its share of honors, including being ranked as one of the Top 100 Courses in the U.S. by Best Golf magazine. Golf Digest also recognized the club as One of Nebraska's Top Golf Courses in 2006-07. The club also features a spacious, full-service clubhouse, including Palmer's Pub for casual dining fare. Other amenities include a new aquatic complex,with a Jr. Olympic pool and a Snack Shack on site."

"Union Pacific Railroad Bailey Yard","Nebraska","Union Pacific Railroad Bailey Yard - North Platte, Nebraska - Railroad Classification Yard","Union Pacific Railroad Bailey Yard is located in North Platte, Nebraska and is the largest railroad classification yard in the world. It is probably best viewed from the Golden Spike Tower in North Homestead Road, which is an observation platform open year round except Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. From the start of October to the end of April the Tower opens from 10am to 5pm Monday to Saturday and 1pm to 5pm on Sunday, whilst the rest of the year it opens 9am to 7pm Monday to Saturday and 1pm to 7pm on Sunday. The yard was named after former Union Pacific President Edd H. Bailey and covers a massive area of 2,850 acres reaching a total length of eight miles. The yard handles over 10,000 railroad cars every day of which, 3,000 are sorted daily in the eastward and westward yards known as hump yards. There is also a locomotive fueling and servicing center dealing with more than 8,500 locomotives per month, a locomotive repair shop that repairs up to 750 locomotives annually and a car repair facility that deals with nearly 50 cars per day. There are actually two viewing platforms at the Golden Spike Tower accessible by elevator or stairs including an enclosed one on the 8th floor, which is 100 feet above the ground and offers a 360 degree view. The 7th floor platform is open to the elements allowing visitors the chance to hear the sounds of the railroad below them. At the main entrance to the tower is a single story depot-style building housing the Visitor Center, which features Union Pacific Railroad and Nebraskan historical and educational displays as well as a gift shop with items produced by local artists. The Golden Spike Tower is open to visitors for a small admission fee but there are opportunities to observe the yard from other points nearby. The Birdwood Crossing or the Buffalo Bill overpass enable people to watch the diesel engines, box cars and other activity at the yard, 24 hours a day. It is a busy yard employing over 2,600 people and is described by Union Pacific as an economic barometer of America.'' Previous visitors to Bailey Yard and the Golden Spike Tower have recommended getting directions from the North Platte visitor guide. Whilst there are some coin operated distance viewers available on the viewing platforms, taking a pair of binoculars or long distance lens camera would be useful. It is a good place for train buffs to visit and visits are generally self guided tours, but tour guides for groups can be made available upon request. Several hotels are located in the city including Comfort Inn, Super 8 North Platte and Holliday Inn Express. A number of restaurant and bars are in the area too such as Applebee's at Platte Oasis Parkway and Canteen Bar & Lounge in S Jeffers Street.

"University of Nebraska Callitrichid Research Center - Omaha, Nebraska university animal research center","Nebraska","University of Nebraska Callitrichid Research Center - Omaha, Nebraska university animal research center","The Callitrichid Research Center at the University of Nebraska at Omaha is an animal research center that focuses on animal behavior and hormones among callitrichids, better known as marmosets and tamarins. Established in 1983, the Callitrichid Research Center is funded by grants from a variety of private and public sources. The Research Center does work on the reproductive biology and behavior of endangered callitrichids. The Callitricdhid Research Center began in 1983 with preliminary funding provided by the University of Nebraska Omaha. The University provided several small grants that allowed the research center to gather preliminary data and research in support of attracting larger grants. In 1987, the research center attracted a 2-year $50,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant funded research into the biology and reproductive behavior of primates that may be invaluable in better understanding nurturing behavior and helping zoo keepers and administrators around the world better support captive breeding and conservation programs with primates and marsupials. The National Institutes of Health have continued to provide funding for specific projects at the Callitrichid Research Center. Most recently, the NIH is funding a five-year project on offspring development and nurturing. The research undertaken at the Callitrichid Research Center has been published in many papers and other publications, including a booklet on the care of marmosets and tamarins intended for any zoo or exhibit caring for those particular animals. The language is simple to understand and the guide explains in no-nonsense terms how to enrich and support callitrichids in captivity. Since 1989, the Callitrichid Research Center has been funded by the National Science Foundation through the Animal Behavior Program. The current grant funding is a continuation of projects begun in 2001 to study child-rearing behavior in marmosets. Marmosets are new world monkeys, generally about the size of a common tree squirrel. They are monogamous, and engage in community child-rearing where all members of a marmoset colony are involved in caring for the young at various stages of the children's lives. The Callitrichid Research Center has been responsible for numerous discoveries about the behavior and biology of reproduction among these monkeys because their marmoset colony, established in 1991, is now three to four generations old. The Callitrichid Research Center is not open to the public on any regular basis, but tours can be arranged for those interested in learning more about these primates. For more information about the Callitrichid Research Center, contact Director Jeffrey French at 402-554-2558."
"Visitors Love Nebraska's Quirky Carhenge Attraction","Nebraska","Visitors Love Nebraska's Quirky Carhenge Attraction","A whimsical tribute to England's famed Stonehenge, Nebraska's Carhenge evokes both smiles and expressions of surprise from visitors and locals who stop to view the unique sculpture, which sits on 10 acres outside the small town of Alliance in the state's High Plains region. Carhenge is the creation of sculptor Jim Reinders who - with the help of family members - erected his replica in 1987 as a tribute to his father, who farmed the land on which the sculpture sits. Reinders had previously lived in England and had shown particular interest in studying the design and purpose of the famous English landmark, which archaeologists believe was erected around 2500 BC. Upon returning to the U.S., Reinders, who had already designed a number of unusual creations made of unique materials, devised the idea of a replica built with old automobiles and dubbed it Carhenge.'' Nebraska boasts a number of roadside sculptures but Carhenge is probably the most well known. It consists of a design that very closely echoes Stonehenge. A circle of cars makes up the major portion of the sculpture. Inside the circle are 3 standing trilithons (two vertical cars supporting a horizontal car). Outside are the heel stone, the slaughter stone, two station stones, and the Aubrey circle, which is named for Sir John Aubrey, the professor who is credited with recognizing Stonehenge as a prehistoric temple. The circle measures 96 feet and the proportions of the Carhenge sculpture match those of Stonehenge. Some of the automobiles have been welded into place while others sit in 5-foot-deep holes with their trunk ends down. All the cars are spray painted in a stony gray color. The make and model of the cars vary but Reinders specifically selected a 1962 Cadillac for the heel stone. The lot where Carhenge sits has become something of a roadside art gallery. Dubbed the Car Art Reserve, the acreage is now home to a number of additional sculptures including a spawning salmon by artist Geoff Sandhurst, a dinosaur, a carnastoga wagon'', and another piece by Reinders known as The Ford Seasons'', inspired by a Vivaldi musical composition. Carhenge is no longer maintained by the Reinders family but by an organization of locals known as Friends of Carhenge. The organization has recently added a paved parking lot and picnic tables for visitors who wish to linger at the site and an educational display board near the sculpture tells of the design and building process that developed into Carhenge."
"Wild Horse Golf Club","Nebraska","Wild Horse Golf Club, Gothenburg, Nebraska - a Links-Style Golf Course by the Sand Hills of Nebraska","The Wild Horse Golf Club has been described as a combination of Scottish and Irish links-style golf, set amid 300 acres of rolling hills at the fringe of Nebraska's Sand Hills. There's nary a tree or drop of water on the course, which is lined with virtually unplayable rough of thick, native grasses that can grow to two feet tall. The course, which opened in 1999, features fairly wide fairways that are open and allow players to choose their angle to the hole. In typical links fashion, the fairways are also firm, which can add distance to drives, while also inviting players to play their ball along the ground rather than the customary high, spinning approach shots used on most U.S. courses. There are numerous virgin sand hill sand traps placed strategically in the fairways and around the greens, however, adding to the difficulty and the strategy. Two additional defenses of this course are the native winds and the greens, both of which are fast. The greens are fairly large, averaging around 6,000 square feet, but it's been reported that finding a flat area on the greens is only an occasional occurrence. The 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 6,805 yards from the longest (Gold) tees, with a USGA rating of 73.6 and a slope rating of 134 on Blue grass fairways and Bent grass greens. Some of the most noteworthy holes include No. 8, a par-4 that plays to 451 yards from the longest tees. This is one of the most difficult holes on the course, even though it plays very straight. The difficulty comes from the huge blowout fairway bunker on the left that's nearly as deep as most golfers are tall, and it's reachable off the tee with an assist from the wind. Approach shots then take aim at a green with two large humps that can make for some difficult putting. Hole No. 11 may appear to be an inviting par-3, playing to a meager 126 yards from the longest tees, while featuring a very large green. That's the beauty of this hole, however, which is guarded by bunkers left, right and in front, while the green is undulating and slopes from right to left, making a two putt here a major accomplishment. Hole No. 15 has a similar nature - short, but treacherous. This par-4 plays to only 342 yards from the back tees, but several fairway bunkers challenge every tee shot. The green is also guarded by more bunkers front and back, and the putting surface is both tiny and shallow, sloping from the back to the front. Since its opening, Wild Horse Golf Club has been rated one of the best golf courses in the state and the country. Golfweek magazine ranked it #21 among the Best Modern Courses in 2005. And GOLF Magazine named Wild Horse the 4th Best U.S. Course for Under $50, to name a few of its awards. Practice facilities include a driving range and practice greens, with lessons also available. The club also features a large brick clubhouse with a pro shop."

"Willa Cather Memorial Prairie","Nebraska","Willa Cather Memorial Prairie - Red Cloud, Nebraska - Prairie","Willa Cather Memorial Prairie is Located 5 miles south of Red Cloud on Highway 281 near the Kansas/Nebraska border in Webster County. It is a 609 acre area of grazed mixed-grass prairie that is owned and maintained by the Cather Foundation. Willa Cather was a Pulitzer Prize winning author, who was brought up in Nebraska and liked to write about the Great Plains, writing novels such as O Pioneers! and My Antonia. Willa Cather was only nine when she first came to Webster County from Virginia in 1883, and discovered the vast open prairies of Nebraska, which made a lasting impression on her. The Cather Foundation was set up in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is dedicated to promoting the life and works of Cather, and strives to show the public the things she enjoyed. The foundation has also helped restore properties important to the author including Garber Bank Building, the Cather Childhood Home and the Grace Episcopal Church. This area is a good example of the native grassland that covered Nebraska many years ago, and gives visitors the chance to explore its beauty. This includes during the summer months the many wildflowers growing among the tall native grasses. There are approximately two miles of walking and hiking trails for members of the public to explore, where they may enjoy the views and plants without getting lost. Bird watchers are attracted to the prairie as it is home to numerous species of birds such as meadowlarks, upland plovers, wood ducks, blue-winged teals, blue birds, assorted sparrows, grouse, turkeys, orchard orioles amongst others. The site is recognized as a Nebraska Bird Site by the Nebraska Teaming with Wildlife Coalition. Five natural springs are located here and the Foundation has been working to restore these and protect them from the prairie's grazing cattle. The area is an important site for naturalists with around 250 reliant plant species growing here including the rare Fremont's evening primrose and Fendler's aster, which are considered to be endangered. There are many other plant species here ranging from purple prairie clover and coneflower to Canada wildrye or buffalo grass Various educational programs and workshops are held at the prairie including the annual Prairie Writers' workshop, which was first held in June 2008. Writers spend a lot of time on the Prairie gathering inspiration for their works of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry. The Foundation is working with schools in producing educational brochures explaining prairie ecology and animal life as well as providing tours to high schools and other visiting groups. Visitors to Red Cloud looking for somewhere to stay overnight or longer will find a number of hotels in nearby Kearney, including the Holiday Inn Express, Motel 6 and Microtel Inn and Suites, which are all within 15 miles of the prairie. There are restaurants in Kearney too such as the steak house Skeeter Barnes. Even closer is the large scale museum in Minden called Harold Warp's Pioneer Village, which features many historical American artifacts."
