"Abraham Lincoln Birthplace","Kentucky","Abraham Lincoln Birthplace, Hodgenville, KY","In the town of Hodgenville, Kentucky, Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, on the 300-acre Sinking Spring Farm. He lived here in a log cabin for about two years and then his family moved about ten miles away to the Knob Creek Farm. Almost exactly 100 years after his birth, the Lincoln Memorial Building was built that now houses a log cabin similar to the one he was born in. Hodgenville, KY, is now home to several monuments which honor the 16th President who was born there. The Lincoln Memorial Building, which was built on the Sinking Spring Farm, is certainly the largest of the monuments - and the most costly, too. This Memorial Building had its cornerstone laid by President Theodore Roosevelt, and then it was dedicated two years later by President Taft. Each of the 56 marble steps represents one year of President Lincoln's life. The building itself has two floors and shows many aspects of Lincoln's life. The Building also has 16 windows, 16 rosettes on the ceiling, and 16 fence posts, all reflecting the fact that Lincoln was the 16th President. There is no cost to see this museum. It also contains the Bible of Abraham Lincoln's parents. Although it was early believed that the log cabin in the Memorial Building was the original, it quickly became apparent that it was not. It had been toted around the country by a man claiming it was Lincoln's first home. In reality, he had grabbed a two-story log cabin, cut it down to size, and then claimed it was the genuine home. The same man also claimed he had the log home that Jefferson Davis was born in - which was also not true. That log cabin is at his birthplace - which is about 200 miles away. Another exhibit that commemorates President Lincoln is the Lincoln Museum. It has 12 historical scenes taken from Lincoln's life that are believed to be the major events of his life. Wax figures clearly provide a three-dimensional aspect to these displays. Other memorabilia, art, artifacts from the Civil War and more exhibits also reveal more about his life and times. Not far from there is the Knob Creek Farm, which is where Lincoln spent his early childhood until the age of 7 - also in a log cabin. Here you will find the Lincoln Boyhood Home on Knob Creek, which is similar to the one he was born in. It was at this home where young Abe caught a glimpse of slavery. A very popular event that takes place in Hodgenville, KY, is the Lincoln Jamboree. This Jamboree started back in 1954, and became the best showplace in Kentucky for country music. It is an evening the family will love as they provide music, humor and entertainment. There is also a restaurant that provides some country cooking for the guests, too. Free campsites are also provided on the weekends - with electricity. Visiting the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace, Hodgenville, KY, will also provide you with opportunity to see other historic sights and places for sightseeing. Not far away are the famous Mammoth Cave, the Horse Cave, and Kentucky Down Under - all excellent places to take the kids and have a great day."
"American Cave Museum","Kentucky","American Cave Museum, Horse Cave, KY","The American Cave Museum of Horse Cave, KY, is really a powerful testimonial as to how wise land usage and preservation can pay off in modern times. The actual Horse Cave, which was also called the Hidden River Cave, had been closed for years due to the town's using it for a dump site and passing sewage into the river that flowed through the cave. After a new sewage plant had been built nearby in 1989 and the cave cleaned up, the Cave was reopened and tours began once again. The group responsible for the cleanup is called the American Cave Conservation Association. At the time, Horse Cave was considered to be the most polluted cave in America. The Association built their headquarters on top of the cave, knowing that when it was clean again, that it would serve as a powerful promotion for their organization. As a result of the successful cleanup of Horse Cave, a museum was created called the American Cave Museum. It would serve as a teaching instrument to prevent polluting natural formations through instructing the public. There are many excellent exhibits that present to listeners valuable information about what causes caves, ground water and how the flow of water and chemicals affects them, how to preserve them, and more. There is also information and an exhibit about Floyd Collins, one of the greatest early explorers of the region who also turned several other caves into public attractions - making them more easily accessible. One of his great grandsons, in fact, is currently one of the tour guides. Other exhibits in the Museum talk about prehistoric cave explorers, as well as how caves are explored today, and what modern equipment is used. Other ones give a history of Horse Cave, a history of nearby Mammoth Cave, a photo gallery of caves in America, cave lighting, and an exhibit showing how saltpeter is mined in Kentucky. Tickets are also sold at the museum that lets you go to the Horse Cave, too. This tour of the cave goes down 150' below ground. It starts out with stairs that descends into the sinkhole - which leads to the entrance of the cave. Walkways and bridges in the cave are built out of recycled milk containers, which remind the tourist of the Cave's preservation from its trashy past. Because the American Cave Museum, and its parent organization, was created for the preservation of caves, there are also a number of specialized tours offered for different ages that are given to further promote this theme. Tours are also given that actually let the groups see the cave outside of the beaten path. These Adventure Tours take the group to special areas of the cave and the guides teach about different cave structures, cave life, environmental issues, and cave development. These tours can be more strenuous and include bending, hiking, climbing, crawling and getting dirty. Cave safety is discussed beforehand, and helmets and lights are supplied, but warm clothing is also needed. Tours run either two or three hours in length. Many other well-known caves are also in the area - including Mammoth Cave. Tickets for other caves can be purchased at the American Cave Museum of Horse Cave, KY. Many other sights are also nearby, which are a must-see for you and your family."

"Belterra Golf Club","Kentucky","Belterra Golf Club, Florence, Indiana - Considered One of the Top 20 Casino Golf Courses in the Country","The Belterra Golf Club is part of the Belterra Casino Resort and Spa, and one of the resort's most highly rated amenities. The course is an 18-hole, par-71 championship course designed by the legendary Tom Fazio and located in a picturesque area bordered by the Ohio River, Log Lick Creek and some Indiana ridges. In designing the course, Fazio highlighted the area's natural surroundings and wound the layout through lakes and more than 2,200 trees. The course plays to 6,925 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 136. Water is the most noteworthy hazard on the course, coming into play on 12 of the 18 holes. There are also 41 sand bunkers strategically positioned in the fairways and guarding the greens. One of the most noteworthy holes on the course is the par-5 No. 4 hole. At 543 yards from the Black tees, this is the longest hole at Belterra. Adding to the difficulty is a fairway with a good many undulations, as well as a prevailing slope toward a water hazard lurking on the left. Nearer the hole, four sand bunkers await to capture short approach shots. Hole No. 5 is another noteworthy hole and the most difficult on the course. It's a par-4 that plays to 478 yards from the back tees, with a fairway that narrows dramatically as golfers approach the hole. There's a large water hazard that begins at about the fairway's midpoint and runs to the left side of a bunkered green. Hole No. 7 is a beautiful par-3 that plays to 188 yards from the Black tees. Trouble is possible for any shot that misses the green, as a large water hazard pushes into the fairway and guards the green on the right. Hole No. 15 is a par-4 that plays to 465 yards and is the second-most-difficult on the course. Once again golfers will encounter a fairway with significant undulations, as well as bunkers left and right. The hole doglegs to the left and a water hazard comes into play on the left on the approach to a bunkered green. Hole No. 18 is considered the signature hole, a par-5 that plays to 522 yards at its longest. This is one of the more open holes on the course with a fairly wide fairway. Nine bunkers line the fairway and guard the green, however, and another large water hazard comes into play on the right and runs past the putting surface. The course has received a number of accolades, including being ranked among the Top 20 Casino Golf Courses in the United States by Golfweek in 2007 and receiving a 4?-star rating by Golf Digest Places to Play. Practice facilities include a full-length driving range where players can take advantage of unlimited practice balls. The facility also offers putting greens, a chipping area and practice bunkers.

Named for John and Henry Churchill, the racetrack is known for hosting the Kentucky Derby and the Breeder's Cup. The Churchills leased the land to their nephew, Colonel Meriwether Clark Jr., who opened the track in 1875. The first Kentucky Derby was held that same year.

"Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum","Kentucky","Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum - Corbin, KY - Historic Restaurant","As most everyone knows, no one can make chicken quite like the Colonel. Visitors can see where it all started by going to the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum, in Corbin, KY. This Museum has been rebuilt and looks just the way it did when Colonel Sanders ran it. Harland Sanders moved to Corbin, KY in 1930 and set up a small shop in the back of a service station to serve lunch. He experimented with various chicken recipes until he found the one that is still being used today - with 11 herbs and spices. Word quickly got around that his fried chicken was excellent and he soon had to expand his restaurant - making room for all that would come. His shop originally had just one table. In 1937, he had built a restaurant large enough to serve 142 people, and a hotel. Fire destroyed it all in 1939, but it was rebuilt to look exactly like it had before. Today, it is a historical Museum where visitors can still enjoy the famous Colonel's Kentucky Fried Chicken - and do it in the original dining room, too. Some time in the 1950's the Colonel began selling his famous business and recipe to various franchisees across the United States and Canada. Some time later he began selling his chicken as fast food. If you visit the city of Corbin, KY, in September, there is an annual World Chicken Festival. Every year the city gets together for a lot of fun. Musical groups come - both Gospel and country music, and they also bring out the world's biggest skillet - that, of course, is for the fried chicken. There are also some other special happenings at the World Chicken Festival. This includes rides on a large Ferris wheel and 24 other ones for visitors of all ages. A number of contests are also held, such as the Harlan Sanders look-alike contest, the Hot Wings Eating Contest, a mother-daughter and father-son look-alike contest, and many more. Several kids' programs are also on the list of activities, too. This includes puppet programs, magic shows, karaoke, and a Kid's Day Circus. Close to the town of Corbin, KY, and the Harland Sanders Cafe and Museum, visitors will also find a number of other places worth seeing. This would certainly include the Chained Rock, which is in the Pine Mountain State Resort Park. Visitors can also go to the Library of Mountain Millstones which is the largest collection of millstones in the US, and visitors can also see a little known and out of the way monument of Abraham Lincoln that was carved by an unknown peddler as he passed through the area.

"Hidden Cove Golf Course at Grayson Lake State Park","Kentucky","Hidden Cove Golf Course at Grayson Lake State Park, Olive Hill, Kentucky Called a ``Hidden Treasure'' Among America's Top Public Golf Courses","Hidden Cove Golf Course is part of the Kentucky State Park System, and is located in Grayson Lake State Park in Olive Hill. The course has been rated one of the best public golf courses in the state, including being ranked #6 in Kentucky by Golf Digest in 2005, and also being called a Hidden Treasure'' and named the #4 Best New Affordable Public Course'' in America in 2004 by the same publication. The layout is spacious and the 18-hole, par-72 course plays to 7,173 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 139. The course was designed by Brian T. Ault and opened for play in 2003. Course features include rolling Bent grass fairways lined by tall, mature trees, as well as 79 bunkers, including some of the largest white-sand bunkers found anywhere. The course plays around the shores of scenic Grayson Lake and also features two ponds and three streams to add to the view and the challenge. The greens are also Bent grass and range in size from medium to large with moderate undulations. The course also features several ravines, a number of blind approach shots to the greens, as well as the longest hole found on any of the 19 Kentucky State Park System courses. That would be hole No. 16, which plays to a whopping Tiger-proof'' 647 yards from the back tees. The hole also features a good many bunkers, some of them massive, to add to the challenge. Another noteworthy hole is another par-5, the No. 5 hole. This hole plays to a more moderate 545 yards from the back tees and only 497 yards from the Whites. The challenge can be found in a fairway that dips down at its mid-point, forcing golfers to hit uphill approach shots past some very large sand bunkers. Hole No. 12 is another par-5 that presents most of its challenge off an elevated tee. The hole plays to 538 yards from the back tees, but only 440 yards from the Whites. The key is avoiding any shots to the left, as the fairway slopes toward as even steeper rough filled with trees. Hole No. 14 is another picturesque and challenging hole. This par-4 plays to a mere 328 yards from the White tees, but it can still cause some difficulties. The hole plays uphill and features bunkers along the way, and, while the green is massive, the slope may make for some long, long putts. Practice facilities at Hidden Cove include a driving range and short-game practice area. For golfers and visitors who wish to stay on-site, the park offers private accommodations in cottages that offer views of the lake or woods. Each cottage features a screened-in porch or deck, tableware and cooking utensils, with fresh linens provided daily.

"Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky","Kentucky","Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky","Keeneland was founded in 1935; the thoroughbred racing facility and sales complex is located in Lexington, Kentucky. The facility is a nonprofit racing and auction entity set on 147 acres of farmland purchased by Jack Keene.  The races at Keeneland have been held during the months of April through October, since 1936. When the track first opened on October 11th, 1936, more than 11,000 people attended the parks open house. Keeneland is well known for its elaborate reference library, the collection contains over 10,000 pieces, volumes which include video tapes, newspaper clippings and photographic negatives. Keenland held its inaugural race on October 15th, 1936 and the paid attendance for the nine day fall race series was 25,337. On April 25th, 1938, the track held its first auction with a total of 31 lots being bought at a total cost of $24,885.00. Between 1943 and 1946, Keeneland was rated a suburban'' plant and requested not to operate during wartime, due to a rubber shortage.  As a result, the Keeneland Association rented facilities at Churchill Downs and the spring meets were held there during 1943 through 1945. The racing side of Keeneland is known as the Keeneland Race Course. From the time of its inception, Keeneland has taken all winnings and proceeds from racing and auctions, and donated the monies back into the Thoroughbred industry and the surrounding communities. In the springtime, the racing meets contain preps for the Kentucky Derby, the best known of which is the Blue Grass Stakes, and in the fall, the race track features many Breeders Cup preps. Keeneland takes great pride in maintaining the traditions and history of racing; it is the last racing track in North America to broadcast over a public address system. Because the appearance of the track has changed so little over the past several decades, racing scenes for the movie, Seabiscuit,'' were filmed at the track.  During the summer of 2006, the dirt track was replaced with Polytrack, in time for the fall racing season. Keeneland is as famous for its racing as it is for its Thoroughbred sales. Every year, the track holds five horse auctions that attract buyers from all over the world. Over the years, Keeneland has been responsible for breeding and selling some of the biggest names in racing such as, Advancing Star, Caress and Fat Fleet Feet.

"Kentucky Coal Mining Museum","Kentucky","Kentucky Coal Mining Museum - Benham Kentucky - Where the History of Coal Mining Meets Coal Miner's Daughter Loretta Lynn","The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum in Benham, KY, may not be the most fascinating place you'll ever visit, but if you want to read about the geology of coal, to see coal fossils, to walk through the corridors of a mocked-up mine, to see fascinating photographs of coalminers, and to view an exhibit on the life of Loretta Lynn that takes up an entire third floor - then this is your place. Housed in the former company store that sat in the former company town that was put up in 1910 by the Wisconsin Steel Corp., the museum features the headlamps and helmets of coal miners, carts that hauled coal from mines, a coal tipple, a model electric locomotive that kids can climb on, and re-created rooms that include the kitchen of a miner's family, the office of the company dentist, and a schoolroom. Between the rooms are all sorts of interactive exhibits as well as displays from the company hospital, early mining tools, commissary goods, and items from miners' homes. No doubt the most popular exhibits are those dealing with the life of Loretta Lynn, the famous singer and coalminer's daughter, who was born in Butcher Hollow some 60 miles from Benham, and the preservation of whose image has become a cottage industry in eastern Kentucky. Walking through the third floor you can see portraits of Lynn painted throughout her career, photographs of Lynn, dresses Lynn wore on stage, as well as listen to some of Lynn's recordings. Outside you can have your picture taken next to a two-ton block of coal cut specially for the museum. Though some museum patrons have praised it with comments like a great place to visit'' and well worth the time,'' the traveler who complained of being sorely displeased'' with the hokey'' exhibits, and who called the exhibit on Lynn pretty lame,'' was probably closer to the mark. In short, you cannot go wrong skipping this attraction. In fact, if you're in the area you can make a much better use of your time by driving 5 minutes down the road to visit the Museum's companion facility, Portal #31 - a real coal mine where you put on real coal miner's protective gear and take a ride into depths where real coal miners worked. The Kentucky Coal Mining Museum is located on Route 160 in central Benham. Hours are: Monday - Saturday: 10:00 am - 5:00 pm Sunday: 1:00 pm - 4:00 pm Admission is: $5.00 for Adults $4.00 for Senior Citizens $2.50 for Children and Students"

"Kentucky Reptile Zoo","Kentucky","Kentucky Reptile Zoo - Slade, KY - One of the Largest Collections of Venomous Snakes in the World","Unless you count a night spent at the Li'l Abner Motel, there are only two things worth doing in Slade, KY. One of them is to visit Kentucky's fabulous Natural Bridge State Park. The other is to make your way to the Kentucky Reptile Zoo, which houses one of the largest collections of poisonous snakes in the world, and where it is possible to watch the zoo's director extract venom from black mambas and Monocled cobras. The Reptile Zoo's collection of snakes includes such notables as an 18-foot-long reticulated python, a gaboon viper (the fangs of one, the longest fangs ever measured, ran to 2.5 inches), to some of the oldest cobras in captivity. These snakes come from all over the world, as well as from the occasional police raid on illegal snake dealers who sell them as pets, or for use in certain Appalachian Mountain religious rites. The zoo has other reptiles of course: lizards and aquatic turtles and a desert tortoise that might walk over and let you pet it. And alligators, including a favorite named Fluffy, and babies which, for $7.00, will let you hold them for a picture. The zoo gives gator talks and other lectures on reptiles, and has a myriad of educational programs for schools. But venomous snakes are the main attraction here - the snakes, and standing close-up while the zoo's director, Jim Harrison, holds them by their necks and squeezes venom from their fangs. Most Sundays you can see him wringing out the venom from the zoo's 12-foot king cobra. If this job sounds dangerous, it is. Harrison was once pronounced clinically dead from a snakebite, although, unlike Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, he managed to recover from the animal's attack. Harrison loves his job. He's among the world's leading experts on venom, and the so-called milking'' of the reptiles to obtain it for medical researchers. The mamba? Crucial to our knowledge of Alzheimer's disease. The Malayan pit viper? Has helped with the recovery of stroke victims. Advances in the study of viruses, lupus, and skin and breast cancer have all been made in part with the venom of Asian cobras, Russell's vipers, and copperheads. The venom that Harrison extracts usually comes with a price, of course, including $1,000 a gram for the venom of a snouted cobra. But the zoo does make grants to graduate students. Beside the Sunday cobra milkings, a venom show occurs almost every day at 1:00 P.M., but it's a good idea to call ahead to make sure the director isn't off in harm's way on some exotic jaunt. The Kentucky Reptile Zoo is located at: 200 L&E Railroad, Slade, KY Its hours are 11 am to 6 pm daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Admission is: $6.00 for an adult $4.00 for a child (3-15) Free for children under the age of three"
"Kyova Mall is an enclosed shopping mall with stores, dining and entertainment for shoppers","Kentucky","Kyova Mall is an enclosed shopping mall with stores, dining and entertainment for shoppers","Kyova Mall is located outside of Ashland, Kentucky. The mall opened in 1988 as Cedar Knoll Galleria but became a dead mall as it struggled to keep tenants. In 2005 the mall was redeveloped and traffic has increased to the mall. The original mall was developed on the site of a former golf course and was approximately 600,000 square feet in size. The mall was not convenient for Ashlands residents even thought it was located near Interstate 64. By 2001 the food court had no restaurant and Kmart's bankruptcy forced the closure of Kmart in the mall. The mall was purchased by Eggleston Associates in 2005 and redevelopments of the mall began. The mall was renamed Kyova Mall, a new roof was installed, and plans for a movie theatre were discussed. It was decided that a Phoenix Theaters with 10 screens would opened in 2007. The Mall has many clothing stores such as Wilma's dress shop the features bridal and formal wear. Sophia's features makeover, clothing and accessories and Lee Middleton Dolls. A Dollar tree is also located in the mall and Custom Metal Creations opened in 2009.

After a law was passed approving alcohol sales in the country to a 67% margin. This law was pushed by the mall management to help boost business by attracting new restaurants. The restaurants that have opened in the mall are RJ Kahuna's Sports Bar & Grill, Callihan's American Pub and Grill is a pub with a two story mezzanine."
"Lafayette Golf Club at Greenfarm Resort","Kentucky","Lafayette Golf Club at Greenfarm Resort, Falls of Rough, Kentucky ? Rated the #2 Golf Course in Kentucky by Golf Digest","Lafayette Golf Club is spread over 250 acres of land on the historic Green Farm property, a former Kentucky plantation, alongside the Rough River. The rolling terrain is varied and incorporates many lakes, rivers, hills and open spaces, and the course features both links-style holes as well as wooded-style. The 18-hole, par-72 course opened for play in 1997 and features lush, Bermuda-grass fairways and Bent grass greens, surrounded by Kentucky bluegrass rough. The course plays to 6,843 yards from the Black tees, with a USGA rating of 73.9 and a slope rating of 133. The course was designed by Jody Kinney of Dublin, Ohio, and is considered one of the best, most picturesque and challenging in the state. Golf Digest ranked it the #2 course in the state for 2007-2008, and also awarded it a 4-Star rating for 2008-2009. Sand bunkers are not a prominent feature of the course, and golfers will only find a handful, but there are trees and water. In fact, one of the most distinctive features of the course is the number of water hazards, which come into play on 11 of the 18 holes. The greens are another noteworthy and challenging feature of Lafayette Golf Club, as they've been reported to be very fast. There are a number of noteworthy holes on a course that has been described as a diamond in the rough,'' including hole No. 1. This par-4 plays to 430yards from the Black tees and is the #1-handicap hole on the course. While the layout is pretty straightforward, this tree-lined fairway calls for accurate shot-making all the way to the green. Another noteworthy hole is No. 5, a picturesque par-3 that plays to 192 yards from the longest tees. A pond sits to the left just off the tee and shouldn't come into play, but a creek flows along the entire hole and past the green, and any shots to the right will probably find this hazard or the many trees that line both banks. Hole No. 10 is a par-5 and the longest on the course, playing to 556 yards from the back tees and only slightly less at 526 from the Whites. The layout is fairly straightforward, but golfers will have to contend with trees on both sides of the fairway, as well as a few of the sparse sand bunkers on the course. The approach shot to the green may be the most daunting shot of all, as the green is guarded by a bunker on the left and surrounded on the right and back by a large water hazard. Practice facilities at Lafayette Golf Club include a driving range and short-game area. Lessons are also available. The course also offers a Pro Shop and club rental is available. There's also a Snack Bar and a portable BBQ grill that serves up sandwiches for golfers making the turn. The club also offers lodging and has a unique feature in its Green Mansion Bed & Breakfast in an old, refurbished mansion. Built in the early 1800s, the Green Mansion was the centerpiece of the Green Farm at Falls of Rough, and offers visitors a charming place to stay."
"Lincoln's Birthplace Attracts Visitors to Central Kentucky Town","Kentucky","Lincoln's Birthplace Attracts Visitors to Central Kentucky Town","While Illinois deems itself The Land of Lincoln'', a small town in central Kentucky enjoys its status as the birthplace of the 16th president of the United States. Hodgenville, Kentucky, the town where Thomas and Nancy Lincoln gave birth to Abe in 1809, commemorates its favorite son by welcoming visitors to the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace, a National Historic Park since 1939 and a designated National Historic Site since 1959. Visitors to the Lincoln birthplace can view two different attractions. The first, which the National Park Service (NPS) refers to as the birthplace unit'', is a marble and granite neo-classical style building constructed around the time of Lincoln's 100th birthday. Designed by John Russell Pope, who also drew up the plans for Washington D.C.'s Jefferson Memorial, the building sits on 116 acres of the Lincoln family's Sinking Spring Farm. The staircase that leads to the structure consists of one step for each of Lincoln's 56 years. Inside, guests will find a replica of the cabin in which young Abe was born. The tiny cabin was believed to have measured 13x17 feet in size with just one door and window. In addition to the cabin, visitors can view other displays pertinent to Lincoln's life in Kentucky. The second attraction at the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site is Knob Creek Farm, located about 10 miles from the birthplace unit but still a part of the National Park. This 230-acre farm is where the Lincoln family moved when their son was about 2 years old. They resided there for about 5 years and the homestead was demolished in 1870, despite its historical significance. A replica cabin with period furniture was later constructed on the site and includes logs that the National Park Service claims have a tangible link to the Lincoln family. The Historic Preservation Training Center of Frederick, Maryland began a restoration project on the Knob Creek Farm cabin in October 2008 in hopes of stabilizing the structure. No completion date has been set. A Visitor Center is located at the birthplace unit, where guests may view an 18-minute film on Lincoln's Kentucky years. In addition, the Visitor Center also includes several exhibits and an educational bookstore. All tours of the National Historic Site are self-guided and guests should allow at least an hour to visit the park. Hiking trails for active visitors are available as well and allow guests to explore the area inside the park. The 1-mile-long Big Sink Interpretive Trail is suitable for all visitors while the 3-mile Overlook Trail is more rugged and strenuous but still accessible to inexperienced hikers."
"Louisville International Airport (Standiford Field) - Louisville, KY Joint civil-military airport","Kentucky","Louisville International Airport (Standiford Field) - Louisville, KY Joint civil-military airport","Louisville International Airport, or Standiford Field as it was once known, is used both as a passenger airport (including cargo operations) and a military base. Located in Louisville, Kentucky, it sees around 3.6 million passengers as well as 4.3 billion pounds of cargo annually, seeing it ranked third in the whole of North America for the amount of cargo it handles. Standiford Field was built for Army operations in 1941 and was named after local businessman and politician Dr Elisha David Standiford, before being given to Louisville Air Board in 1947 so it could be used commercially. By the end of the 1980's, thanks to major expansion and improvement projects, it became the main passenger airport for those in the Louisville area as well as being a prime spot for cargo handling. The primary UPS air hub, Worldport, is located in the airport and is capable of handling some 304,000 packages every day in its 80-football-field-length facility. This is due to expand even more with a $1 billion pound project to see it increase in size to 5.1 million square feet, due to be completed by 2010. The airport is also still home to the Kentucky Air National Guard, hence its status as being used for military operations as well as civilian. The airport covers 1,200 acres and is home to three runways - two parallel and one crosswind - offering facilities for nearly 171,000 operations (take-offs and flights) a year. The passenger terminals include 23 gates and cover 360,000 square foot.

Airlines include Delta, NWA, Midwest and United Express, to name but a few. Facilities at the airport provide the visitor with everything they would come to expect, including food outlets, restaurants, newsagents, banks and currency exchange. The Food Court offers fast-food favorites such as KFC and Starbucks, and for those wanting a longer meal there's Woodford Reserve Bar & Grill. Then there are bookshops, convenience stores, flower sellers and even a market place, and for business travelers free Wi-Fi is available throughout, so all areas are covered. Parking isn't a problem with some 5,775 parking spaces offered at points throughout the airport, including a four-level parking garage and a surface lot for long stays. Prices range from $1 per hour to $18 as a maximum day rate, then there's valet parking at $20 per day and handicap parking of $9 per day.

"Louisville Slugger Museum","Kentucky","Louisville Slugger Museum - Louisville, Kentucky - Baseball Museum Teaches Principles of Bat Making","In 1996 the Louisville Slugger Museum opened in downtown Louisville on Main Street. One year later the Museum moved to its present location which just a few blocks from where, in 1875, J.F. Hillerich had his factory that would later produce its first baseball bats. Outside the building, what is billed as the world's tallest bat leans upon the 5 story structure rising at least 1.5 stories above the roof of the museum and bat factory. The museum is located at 800 West Main Street at 8th in Louisville, Kentucky. On its tenth anniversary the Museum changed its name from Museum'' to Museum and Factory'' to better represent the experience that awaits visitors. While the museum displays what is said to be the world's oldest baseball glove and other exhibits of baseball memorabilia, it also takes visitors through the production process of the famous baseball bat used by the major leaguers. In the first 5 years of existence over one million people had entered the doors of the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory.  The greatest baseball players have been swinging the Louisville Slugger since 1884. Bats used by the likes of Babe Ruth and Joe DiMaggio are among those featured in the museum's exhibits. Visitors should plan on approximately 2 hours for their stay, bearing in mind that on Sundays and holidays there is no bat production under way. Furthermore production is based on factory needs, thus there may or may not be bat-making at the time of a visit. Even when bats are not under production visitors will still witness the production process through videos recorded for that purpose. Guided tours begin at 9:00 AM and the last tour begins 25 minutes prior to closing. At the end of the tour miniature Louisville slugger bats are given as a souvenir to all visitors. The museum is wheelchair accessible and listening devices are available upon request as well as closed captions for the video portions of the tour. The museum is open from 9 AM to 5 PM on Monday through Saturday and from noon to 5 pm on Sunday. From July 1 through August 16 hours are extended until 6 PM. Children under six years of age enter free of charge. Upon arrival personalized bats may be ordered which will be available upon departure or can be ordered and shipped to their destinations.

Group packages for 20 or more people are available for visitors geared toward specific teams upon advance request. Packages can also be arranged to include other local attractions as well as on site dining. Private parties and meetings can also be arranged in advance at the museum.

In 1988, just 8 years after its accreditation, the Zoo received the Edward H. Bean Award for its Woolly Monkey Propagation Program, and it has received international recognition for its numerous conservation and scientific study projects. In addition to its AZA accreditation, the Louisville Zoo is also accredited by the American Museum Association. A visit to the Louisville Zoo is far more than a walk in the park. The exhibits are varied, and include numerous biomes that are home to mixed animal populations from geographic regions around the world. Zoo patrons can visit the ISLANDS exhibit, where they'll encounter a wide range of endangered species in a setting that mimics an Indonesian village, or stroll through Lorikeet Landing, an open aviary where tropical birds interact directly with zoo visitors. Big cat lovers can visit the Alice S. Etscorn Tiger Tundra. The Zoo's long-standing Amur/Siberian Tiger Exhibit has been recently refurbished and updated to be more comfortable for both the tigers and visitors. Zookeepers conduct several tiger training sessions daily which zoo guests can enjoy from a safe distance. The Louisville Zoo's best known exhibit, though, is the Gorilla Forest, which received the 2003 AZA Exhibit Award from the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Home to 11 lowland gorillas and 4 pygmy hippos, Gorilla Forest is more of an interactive adventure than an exhibit. The gorillas are housed in a 4 acre environment with outdoor and indoor spaces. Visitors can watch the gorillas and other animals through glass that surrounds a Discovery Trail, or learn more about them in a modern day Researchers Station where they can observe and take part in conservation efforts at the zoo. In an effort to offer ever more entertainment and education to zoo guests, the Louisville Zoological Gardens has recently opened two new attractions to the public. The more adventurous can take advantage of the Sky Trail High Adventure Course, a challenging but safe trail that includes rickety bridges, cargo nets and rope ladders. For the young - and young at heart - the Zoo now features the Calistoga Splash Park at Glacier Run, a full-featured water area where children can cool off with a wide variety of water-based activities. Above all, the Louisville Zoo is committed to both conservation and education. Among its most popular features is the Metazoo Education Center, the first facility to serve as both an exhibit and a learning center. The Metazoo offers classes on site as well as virtual classes for students all over the world. The Zoo is also involved in conservation efforts, including managed breeding programs for 39 endangered species to help ensure a healthy, captive population of those animals at risk of extinction. The Louisville Zoological Garden is open year-round, closing only on Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Years Day. Admission is nominal, and a portion of each admission fee is directed toward the Zoo's continuing conservation efforts. There are frequent events and activities for both children and adults."

Mammoth Cave National Park consists of 52,830 acres in Edmondson County, Kentucky with smaller areas extending east into Hart and Barren Counties. The park is centered on the Green River, with a tributary, the Nolin River which feeds the Green River just inside the park. The Green River is damned up near the west border of the park, and because of this, only a small section of the river flows freely in the park. The cave is composed of Mississippian-aged limestone strata, which are capped off by a layer of sandstone. The cave has more than 360 miles of passageways, and every year new discoveries and several miles increase the length. The upper sandstone layer is known as the Big Clifty Sandstone, which are thin, interspersed layers containing sandstone and tiny conduits, too small to enter. The Main Cave on the lower level is located at the bottom of the Girkin Formation and the St. Genevieve Layer. Each layer of limestone is divided into further named units and subunits. The older, upper passageways of the cave are dry and have no stalagmites or stalactites, which are formations made by dripping water. The contact between the limestone and sandstone can be witnessed by hiking through the valley up to the ridge tops. Cedar Sink is a large sinkhole at the bottom of a valley in the south region of the park, the sinkhole features a small river on one side and a disappearing bank on the other side. The Mammoth Cave National Park is overseen by the National Park System, and offers many services to guests. Some of the most famous features of the cave such as Grand Avenue, Frozen Niagara and Fat Mans Misery, can be visited by lighted guided tours that last from one to six hours in duration. The park also offers two tours which are lighted only by guests carrying paraffin-lit torches. There are also tours offered that venture away from typical areas, and offer guests the chance to explore through muddy crawl spaces and dusty trails in undeveloped areas of the cave system. Mammoth Cave National Park tours are unique in that each one is part of an interpretive program, and has graphics and artifacts on display throughout the cave. Many of the tour guides include a theatrical component, which provides entertaining presentations for visitors. Mammoth Cave contains an underground labyrinth of caves, and beautiful rolling hills and valleys above ground, visitors can enjoy hiking, picnicking, horseback riding, camping and many more activities. The park and cave system welcomes an estimated 500,000 people annually who flock to enjoy all it has to offer."

"Natural Bridge State Park","Kentucky","Natural Bridge State Park - Slade, Kentucky - Hiking, Swimming, Boating, and the Wonders of Nature in its Rock Formations","It's hard to comprehend scale and the majesty of Kentucky's Natural Bridge - nearly 1,000 tons of sandstone, weathered over the course of more than 1,000 millennia, and nearly 80 feet in length - let alone to describe the awe one feels standing in the middle of it, 65 feet above the ground on a chunk of earth 12 feet thick and 20 feet wide. It's hard, too, to imagine how one could fail to have a memorable experience at the place. The 2,500-acre Natural Bridge State Resort Park, one of the jewels of the Kentucky park system, has something for everybody: hotel rooms with balconies and views; an 80,000 gallon river-themed swimming pool complete with water jets and floor bubblers; a 4-acre pond where you can rent either a paddle boat or its faster cousin, the hydrobike; an island (Hoe-Down Island'') that holds the weekly square dances which have made the place the clogging capital of Kentucky;'' a 54-acre boating and fishing lake; a restaurant that offers everything from seared salmon with saut,ed tomatoes to fried catfish; and a 1960's-vintage sky-lift'' that will take you up to within 500 feet of the bridge's top. For those who prefer to walk, the park offers some 12 trails, ranging from the easy (Henson's Arch Trail, 1/3 mile) to the difficult (Sand Gap Trail, a 7.5 mile, 4-6 hour trip). Like the panorama from atop the bridge, many of these walks offer superb views of the surrounding Daniel Boone National Forest and the Cumberland Plateau Mountains. The park has its origins in the 1890's, when the Kentucky Union Railway, seeing money in the tourist trade, built campsites and hiking trails to lure visitors. In 1926 the land was donated to the state. Despite the views afforded from the rooms at the park's hotel, one of the real joys of Natural Bridge is its collection of rustic cottages, complete with screened porches and working fireplaces, that a visitor can rent quite reasonably - a 1-bedroom with two queen beds for $135 a night. The guests who have overnighted in these charming cabins have raved about them, from we highly recommend this'' and wonderfully rustic,'' to spacious'' and secluded.'' What few complaints one hears about Natural Bridge focus more on the distance from the lodge to the swimming pool than anything else. Then too, once you've made it to the top of the skyway, and witnessed the views, you'll run into the inevitable gift shop - this one featuring 16 flavors of fudge - to mar the experience. Still, one shouldn't quibble. The place truly is breathtaking."

"Old Friends at Dream Chase Farm","Kentucky","Old Friends at Dream Chase Farm - Georgetown, Kentucky - A Bluegrass Stable for Retired Thoroughbreds","How can you go wrong touring a beautiful farm, which sits in the middle of the country's most beautiful pastures, and whose mission it is to rescue some of the most beautiful horses in the world? The answer is, you can't. Since Old Friends at Dream Chase Farm opened, following the 2002 slaughterhouse death of Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand, this retirement home for thoroughbreds has won the hearts of everyone who's visited. Each horse in the stable has a story - of winning and losing, of being passed from one owner to another, and even, occasionally, of abuse. For visitors, Old Friends lacks the sort of hands-off rules that you'd expect of such a place. The staff is accommodating. The horses are friendly. During the one-hour tour you can pet them if they're in the mood, and feed them any number of treats, from carrots and apples to cookies and bananas - and even peppermints. The celebrity of Old Friends is Popcorn Deelites, one of six horses who starred as Seabiscuit in the movie of the same name. Though Popcorn earned just $60,000 in his racing career, he was the blood-bay with dark points that director Gary Ross was looking for to take its turn as the horse that beat triple-crown winner War Admiral. Popcorn's movie acting specialty, it turned out, was to play Seabiscuit breaking from the gate. Other horses at the retirement home include Awad, who won more than $3 million in his racing career, Bonnie's Poker, the mother of Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm, and Bull Inthe (no typo) Heather, who was Ferdinand's most successful son. If the celebrity of Old Friends is Popcorn Deelites, its unquestionable star is a miniature horse named Little Silver Charm. Bought for $40 as he was on his way to what the farm calls a very bad place,'' the smallest stallion at the stable (which, by the way, is the only thoroughbred retirement home that accepts stallions) favors oversized sunglasses and is the friend of horses, people, and goats alike. As one visitor recalled of the Very Little horse, Little Silver Charm nearly steals the show.'' Everybody who goes to Old Friends loves their time there, variously recalling their experiences as fantastic'' and heartwarming'' and the absolute best thing I did while visiting Lexington.'' The farm does not hard-sell its need of donations, but most people, after seeing its splendid animals, have a hard time resisting. As one visitor said later: They don't really mention donations or pressure you at all, but there's something in the horses' eyes telling you `I NEED more carrots PUH-LEEEEEZE!' so you just want to empty your pockets.'' For $100 you can buy a share in one of the horses there - a donation for which you'll get a certificate and a photograph of the horse. Old Friends is located at: 1841 Paynes Depot Rd, Georgetown, KY. It's open seven days a week - but only two to five hours a day - and you need to call ahead to arrange a tour: 502-863-1775."
"Old Silo Golf Course","Kentucky","Old Silo Golf Course, Mount Sterling, Kentucky - Kentucky's #1-Rated Public Golf Course","Old Silo is one of Kentucky's premier public golf courses, and has received accolades such as being rated the Number 1 Public Course in Kentucky'' in 2003 by Golf Digest. The magazine also ranked Old Silo as the 6th Best New Affordable Public Golf Course in America'' in 2002. The 18-hole championship course was designed by PGA Champions Tour player Graham Marsh in 2000 and is situated on 209 acres of rolling, Kentucky bluegrass countryside. The course plays to 6,977 yards and par-72 from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 74.5 and a slope rating of 139. The course features Bent grass tees, fairways and greens, and lush, tree-lined fairways. There are 98 white-sand bunkers, and the course incorporates many scenic and dramatic views created by the rolling terrain and Somerset Creek, which meanders through the property. Some of the particularly noteworthy holes include No. 6, which is named First Glimpse'' for offering golfers their first view of the Old Silo.'' This par-4 plays to 417 yards from the Black tees and a much more manageable 351 yards from the Whites. Not only is this a very picturesque hole, but it's also quite challenging. The tee shot features a dramatic 95-foot drop in elevation to the fairway, and golfers must be wary of the creek that cuts through the fairway not once, but twice. A number of sand bunkers also guard the fairway on the left, making an accurate tee shot a must. The No. 13 hole is another especially scenic and challenging hole. Named Wishbone,'' the par-5 hole plays to a fairway split by two bunkers. A drive to the left of the bunkers presents golfers with a short path to the green, but a riskier route because of the hazardous rough that runs the length of the fairway. On approach, golfers must hit to a challenging green that is shallow, multi-tiered and surrounded by bunkers. The No. 15 hole is a difficult par-4 that plays to 433 yards from the Black tees and a respectable 392 from the Whites. The fairway landing area will have golfers thinking layup, as it ends about 250 yards from the tee and is guarded left and right by bunkers. What follows is an approach shot off a downhill lie that tends to play about 15 yards shorter than the actual yardage. The green presents some challenge as well, guarded in the front by a small creek and bunkers left and right. The practice facilities at Old Silo are considered some of the best in the state and include a 10,000-square-foot putting green, and a chipping green with practice sand bunker. There's also a spacious driving range with Bent grass teeing area and seven target greens. The Old Silo golf shop offers the latest in clothing and equipment, and lessons are also available. The course also features a 6,000-square-foot clubhouse that offers beautiful views of the course from its balcony. For food and drinks, the clubhouse is home to the Old Silo Restaurant, and the facility can also host parties of up to 150 people."

"Pine Mountain State Resort Park","Kentucky","Pine Mountain State Resort Park, Pineville, KY","Just a few miles across the Tennessee-Kentucky state line you can find the Pine Mountain State Resort Park, Pineville, KY. This beautiful resort park is part of the western Appalachian Mountains and provides excellent opportunity for sightseeing and other outdoor activities. The Pine Mountain State Resort Park is part of a single mountain mass that is 25 miles wide and 125 miles in length. Within the park there are elevations ranging from 2,000 feet up to about 3,200 feet in the northeast part. The Pine Mountain State Resort Park was chosen as the first state park of Kentucky in 1924 and it is part of the larger Kentucky Ridge State Forest. At the top of Pine Mountain is the Pine Mountain State Resort which was built in the 1930's. This elegant Lodge with a lot of stone masonry provides many activities and its secluded place enables people to enjoy the outdoors even more. It has 30 rooms for guests, and 20 cottages that are both one and two bedroom. The dining room will seat 120 people and visitors have a scenic view of the area as they dine. Camping is also available Pine Mountain State Resort Park. The Lodge also provides visitors with 10 hiking trails nearby and these give the hiker 15 miles of trails which take them through the gorgeous terrain of the nearby hills. There is also a championship 18-hole golf course, too, called the Wasioto Winds, which is part of the Resort. The course lies in a valley between two mountains. One of the many trails leads to the famous Chained Rock, which was chained back in 1933. Children and some adults of the town of Pineville felt that this rock would fall and do a lot of damage on the town. The 100-foot chain was placed there to prevent it from happening and to bring relief to the young. There is a splendid view from the rock area of the town and region. Many people consider this park to be the most beautiful in the state. Along the trails, which are being made into a long Pine Mountain Trail, you will find a number of places where you can view the abundant wildlife. You can see many birds in the wild, as well as deer, elk, raccoons, opossum, fox, and more. There are special Elk Viewing Tours for groups in January and these tours usually see more than an average of 100 elk at a time.

"Red River Gorge Geological Area","Kentucky","Red River Gorge Geological Area, Winchester, KY","The Red River Gorge Geological Area, Winchester, KY is a great place for visitors to go to in order to see beautiful landscape and rock formations. This special geological area is part of the much larger Daniel Boone National Forest, which contains more than 700,000 acres. The Red River area is just over 25,000 acres. The Red River Gorge Geological Area is unique in its topography. There are many ridges in this region with lots of forest all around. In addition, there are over 3,400 miles of sandstone cliffs packed into this little area. Another wonderful feature of the Park area is that there are over 80 rock arches throughout. This occurs because there is a harder rock layer on top of the softer sandstone. The sandstone gets weathered first, leaving the top layers of the arch remaining. This particular region of Kentucky has more natural arches than anywhere else east of the Rockies. The largest of these arches, called Sky Bridge, is on the top of a ridge, and visitors can get an excellent view of the Gorge area from there. Part of the area where the cliffs are - over 12,000 acres - has been labeled the Clifty Wilderness by Congress in 1993. This enabled the region around the Red River and the cliffs to become a protected area - keeping it free from any encroachment of civilization and anything that disturbs the magnificent solitude of the region. The Red River Gorge National Recreation Trail is a series of trails that runs for many miles through this wilderness. While some of the trails only lead to other ones, some of them will take you to some excellent sights. The Sheltowee Trace is another trail system in the Daniel Boone National Forest, and the two Trails do connect. Because of the rugged terrain, it is not recommended that young children be brought on most of the Trails. Also in the Gorge, visitors will find the Kentucky Reptile Zoo and the Red River Historical Museum. This museum presents some interesting history of the area and also shows some of the territory. For those visitors who like to do some serious climbing, there is the Torrent Falls Family Climbing Adventure. Chimney Rock rises 900 ft above the Gorge and provides an excellent view. Creation Falls is a marvelous waterfall in the Park. Research is currently taking place in the Red River Gorge Geological Area. Scientists are studying some of the places where Indian cultures stayed in the region because of the abundance of natural shelters. In some cases archeological digs are also taking place. Other activities that visitors can engage in are hiking, fishing and hunting, boating, canoeing and camping. There are some scenic drives that are nearby such as the Red River Gorge Scenic Byway. Visitors can also bike their way along special paths that go for 27 miles through the Red River Gorge. There are some special days that visitors can ride with organized groups from the Bluegrass Cycling Club, but be aware that the terrain can be treacherous and rather steep in places. Three lakes are in the area the Red River Gorge Geological Area, Winchester, KY. There is the Cave Run Lake, the Laurel River Lake, and Lake Cumberland - and each of these are large enough for boating. There is plenty of fish in the waters, and you can find smallmouth and largemouth bass, black bass, bluegill, walleye, rainbow trout, sauger and rockfish, and more - but they may be different in each of the lakes."

In this museum which was built in 2006, guests will find more than 32,000 square feet of building, and over 8,000 square feet of exhibits. The Museum is clearly a walk into the world of the past with much memorabilia from Coke, and there are numerous collections from the history of the Coca Cola Company. Displays include the antique delivery vehicles that Coke used in the past, calendars, rare bottles, to the various signs used in their many advertising campaigns. There are also many of the antique vending machines that Coke has come to be known for, as well as some of the machinery used to handle the bottling process of Coke, and various toys. There is also an excellent exhibit featuring many of the classic Coca Cola serving trays that have ever existed. It is the largest collection of trays in the world and contains the complete set. The Schmidt's Museum of Coca-Cola Memorabilia has over 80,000 items in it - although only about 11,000 items are actually on display. Many of these historic items were donated by many people over the years. Because there is some duplicity in the items given, the Museum has various antique items for sale in its store - and they may also be seen on the Schmidt's Museum Web site. These items can be purchased from the store while visiting the Museum, and they are often on sale for less than might be found elsewhere. While touring the museum, visitors can enjoy Coke in the Gift Shop and Soda Fountain. Here they will find a Coke fountain from the 50's era - and at 50's prices - just a nickel, and snacks and sandwiches can also be purchased with the Coke. The Museum also has the Schmidt Museum Hospitality Room. In there visitors will see the elegant Soda Fountain that was used to sell Coca Cola in the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. This room can be obtained for groups and special events. Schmidt's Museum of Coca-Cola Memorabilia, Elizabethtown, KY, is in the middle of a lot of other places nearby that visitors will also want to see.

Closer to the Museum, there is the Lincoln Heritage House, the Black History Gallery, the Cannonball, and the Swope's Cars of Yesteryear Museum. Besides these, there are also some unusual places, too. This would certainly include the World's Longest Go-Kart Track in Shepherdsville, the Hubcap Lady in Jeffersonville, and the Louisville Slugger Museum and the world's largest baseball bat (120 ft.). If you love shooting, there is also the Machine Gun Shoot in West Point, and visitors can shoot an Uzi, a 1919 Tommy gun, or other automatic weapons.

"The General George Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor","Kentucky","The General George Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor - Fort Knox, Kentucky - Where the History of Tanks Meets the Memory of a Legendary General","For anyone who cares about military history, and for a great many who don't, one stop on the museum tour has got to be the General George Patton Museum in Fort Knox, KY. Because of Patton's original strategies for tank warfare, some historians believe him to have been one of the great military thinkers of the ages. The Patton Museum is a shrine to that idea. There are tanks of course - rows and rows of them, both inside the museum and in the park next door, as well as a detailed history of armored warfare from World War One (where Patton began his career as a visionary tank strategist, was shot in the leg while directing a tank, and won a Distinguished Service Cross for heroism) through World War Two (and his armored division's famous breakout in Normandy). The Evolution of Armed Warfare'' tank exhibit is enough reason alone to pay a visit to Fort Knox. Here is one of the British Mark V's - the first tanks ever used, on the Fourth of July, 1918, at the Battle of Hamel. Here's a German Panzer; here's a Sherman; over there are a Soviet T72, and an M1 Abrams of the sort used in the first Gulf War. There are other exhibits as well, of United States Army rifles and pistols and submachine guns; of Nazi, Russian, and North Vietnamese weapons. And on and on. These instruments of war aren't all that you'll find at the Patton Museum. There are also a model of the famous Fort Knox Bullion Depository that was used in the movie Goldfinger, a portion of the Berlin Wall, and the head of a Saddam Hussein statue. Still, it's the documentation of George Patton's life that one really comes to see. There are scores of photographs - of the young West Point cadet, for example; of the general addressing his troops; of the dog-lover with his favorite bull terrier, Willie, who lived with Patton in his truck and followed him into battle. You'll see the clothes he wore, the cars he drove, his wartime souvenirs. You'll see the general's helmet, emblazoned with its three stars, his dress uniform decorated with its medals, his fleece-lined leather jacket, his jodhpurs, riding crops, and, perhaps most fascinating of all, the pair of pearl-handled pistols that Patton famously wore on each hip. Just as intriguing as the personal effects are the vehicles that Patton used, such as his office van, complete with the general's desk and desk chair, his rocking chair, and the Thermos that he used to pour his coffee. Still more interesting is the 1938 (or 1939) Cadillac Model 75 staff car that Patton was (or was not) riding in on December 9, 1945, when he suffered the injuries that led to his death twelve days later.  If all this sounds confusing, it is. While it's difficult to believe that the crushed-up automobile shown in photographs of the alleged accident is the same one sitting on the museum's floor, it's still harder to believe conspiracy theorists convinced that the so-called accident was a cover-up for a plot by the Office of Strategic Services to kill the man. Most people agree that whatever the case, this museum is one to put on your itinerary. Though a few people have quibbled about its being of average caliber'' most come away raving about the place as fascinating,'' and awesome,'' and a must-see.''

From the 1940's through the 1960's, Berger was the president of the International Brotherhood of Ventriloquists. With the assistance of his attorney's, Berger set up a charitable foundation for his assets, property and ventriloquist collection. The Vent Museum was first located in the Berger home and then in his renovated garage, however, the collection outgrew the location.

"Walking Bridge","Kentucky","Walking Bridge - River, Kentucky - The Longest Plastic-Deck Bridge in the World","According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the longest pedestrian bridge in the world, at a half-mile, is the Walnut Street Bridge in Chattanooga, TN. The longest suspended pedestrian bridge, at 554 feet, is in Coaticook, Quebec. But if it's the world's longest plastic-deck suspended footbridge you're looking for, you've got to find your way to tiny River, KY, and to the Forest and Maxine Preston Memorial Pedestrian Bridge. River, KY, is the sort of place, lying in the sort of area, that a plastic bridge can put on the map. The biggest attraction anywhere around River is the Butcher Hollow house where Loretta Lynn grew up. A nearby Ramada Inn can justifiably call itself Eastern Kentucky's Oasis.'' The brainchild of Issam Harik, a civil engineering professor at the University of Kentucky, this cable-suspension bridge runs 420 feet in its span of the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River. It replaced a structure of rusting cables and rotting boards that dated from the 1930's and swayed in the wind, which locals on both banks used in favor of a 20-mile drive to visit relatives on the other side. The old bridge was so terrifying that one man had to blindfold his horse to get it across the span. Harik, who also designed the world's longest plastic-beam bridge, near Cave Run Lake, KY, managed to cajole and wheedle more than a half-million dollars of federal, state, and local money to fund the project. Some of the plastic fibers that went into the decking are stronger than steel. Indeed, the bridge offers such novelty that it has turned out to be a great attraction for the area. People are coming from all over to see it,'' as Patsy VanHoose, the postmaster of River, put it once: We had some people the other night from New York. We've had some from Connecticut - everywhere.'' She's got a point. When New Yorkers will drive ten hours to see a plastic bridge, you know it's worth a visit."

"Woodford Reserve Distillery","Kentucky","Woodford Reserve Distillery, Versailles, KY","In the heart of the Kentucky Bluegrass country is the National Historic Landmark business of the Woodford Reserve Distillery. They are surrounded by thoroughbred horse farms and make small batch bourbon. Attractions near the Woodford Reserve Distillery include Churchill Downs and the Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill. The stone buildings that enclose the distillery are more than one hundred years old. The first building was erected in 1838. Rye, malted barley and corn are used in Woodford Reserve bourbon. The different grains give the bourbon sweetness and spice when it is cooked with the local limestone water. The mash is put into cypress fermentation tanks instead of stainless steel. While the bourbon is being distilled it sits in the copper pots that were made in Rothes, Scotland. Once the alcohol is separated from the water the distillery uses steam to push it into the gooseneck. The bourbon is placed in white oak barrels made in Louisville, Kentucky. These barrels are made without nails or glue. These barrels are known for their strength and sugar content which the distillery has determined is perfect for their needs. During the maturation process the liquid will turn amber because of the changes in the weather. The contrast between the hot summer days and cold winter weather brings about this change. The bourbon begins life in the maturation stage as 158 proof, but the de-mineralized watertakes in to 110 proof. The Woodford Reserve Distillery is located at 7855 McCracken Pike, Versailles, Kentucky 40683. They are open Tuesday through Saturday from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm.
