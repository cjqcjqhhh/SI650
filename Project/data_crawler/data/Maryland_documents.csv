"Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport Baltimore MD - Baltimore Airport Flights","Maryland","Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport Baltimore MD - Baltimore Airport Flights","The Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is in neither Baltimore nor Washington, sitting in an open area south of Baltimore and a good 30 min drive from D.C. However, a bit of open space was necessary to accommodate the area's fastest growing airport. The number of passengers served annually is over 20 million, with AirTran and Southwest pulling down the majority of the travelers. The airport holds the unique distinction of having been voted as one of the nation's healthiest airports by Health Magazine in 2008. In 2010, it will turn 60 years old. However, it has been frequently updated throughout its lifetime, including a recent renovation that combined its five concourses to four, making it easier to navigate the airport. The airport also consolidated its rental car area, offering a quick shuttle to the removed rental station which has all eight of the rental agencies under one roof. Those looking to come to the greater D.C. area for a leisurely vacation are probably best served by flying into BWI, as the airport is commonly known. The smaller layout makes the airport easier to navigate for families and those with crowd or mobility challenges. Additionally, the presence of multiple low-cost carriers means that rates will be cheaper than a Reagan or Dulles flight in most cases. This is also true on the short-hop Caribbean flights offered by the airports. For those coming from Dulles or Reagan, transfers and shuttle services to and from the city are available. Getting to downtown D.C. will be a bigger challenge than getting into Baltimore, especially if one is driving. However, the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport was the first airport to have a dedicated intercity rail connection, so travelers will want to take the train where possible. It connects with both Baltimore (10 min) and D.C. ( 35 min) systems through the Northeast Corridor connection."

The boardwalk is officially named Ocean Avenue. It was first constructed here in 1902 when several hotel owners agreed to construct the wooden walkway here. By 1910 it ran 5 blocks and was expanded again in 1920. After it was destroyed in a storm in March of 1960, it was lengthened to its current 2.5 miles in length. There is an Inlet Indian sculpture here carved of oak from a 100 year old tree. It is meant to represent the Assateague Indian, a sub-group of Nanticokes, according to the sculptor Peter Toth. Toth gave it to the State of Maryland in 1976. The neo-classically designed Pier Building found at the Boardwalk, Ocean City, MD, dates back to 1926. The building's second floor was once used as a ballroom. In front of the boardwalk pier entrance are pavilions that serve for vendors' sales to beach goers and entertainment activities for practically a century. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum is also a local attraction recording local life saving history that began here in 1878. The Station dates back to 1891. It was moved to the current location and opened as a museum in 1977. Admission is free of charge. The oldest observation tower standing on the Maryland seashore is found at this boardwalk as well. The US Coast Guard tower is here since 1935, originally searching for German U-boats as well as life saving. The platform cabin is closed to the public. Among the oldest attractions at the Boardwalk, Ocean City, MD, aside from the ocean and the sand itself, is the carousel at Trimper's amusements. It is operating since 1912.

"Bulle Rock Golf Course, Havre de Grace, Maryland ? ``Maryland's #1-Rated, 5-Star Golf Course,'' According to Golf Digest","Maryland","Bulle Rock Golf Course, Havre de Grace, Maryland ? ``Maryland's #1-Rated, 5-Star Golf Course,'' According to Golf Digest","Bulle (pronounced Bully'') Rock Golf Course takes its name from the first thoroughbred horse brought to America. The course is spread over 235 acres of land in the D.C. area about 40 minutes north of Baltimore near Chesapeake Bay. Designed by legendary course architect Pete Dye, Bulle Rock is said to lack any gimmicks, simply providing a straightforward test of golfing skills over 18 very different holes. Trees, bunkers, swales, and a punishing rough are the most prominent features and hazards golfers will encounter, along with a bit of water coming into play on a handful of holes. The hazards tend to be huge, however, protecting wide fairways and good-sized greens. From the Black tees, the par-72 course plays to a hefty 7,375 yards, with a USGA rating of 76.4 and a slope rating of 147 on Bent grass fairways and greens. The course plays through rolling terrain, and the holes have been described as being built on a massive scale.'' A good example is Hole No. 2, a par-5 that plays to 572 yards from the back tees. From an elevated tee, this picturesque hole plays downhill to a fairway lined on both sides by trees. From there, golfers must contend with a stream that crosses the fairway just short of the green, which is small, elevated and guarded by a pot bunker. Hole No. 4 is considered to be as demanding a par-4 as you'll want to play.'' The hole plays 483 yards from the back tees and is a dogleg left that plays uphill right from the tee. Even a long drive will leave most golfers with a long iron approach to a long, narrow green guarded by two bunkers on either side. Hole No. 11 is another par-5 and the longest hole on the course, playing to a monstrous 665 yards from the tips. The hole is a dogleg left and golfers must also contend with the winds from Chesapeake Bay, which are said to be fierce at times. The fairway also continues to narrow as golfers get closer to the green, which is guarded by eight bunkers. The finishing hole at Bulle Rock has been described by course designer Dye as the most difficult finishing hole I've created.'' The hole is a par-4 that plays to a hefty 459 yards from the Blue tees, and 485 from the Black. From the tee, golfers must favor the right side as trees line the left and then give way to water that plays all the way to the green. Complicating matters, a large knoll on the right often does not allow for a realistic approach shot to the green, which may intimidate further with the ample water hazard that snuggles around the left and back of the putting surface. Since opening in 1998, Bulle Rock has received a number of raves and awards, with Golf Digest proclaiming it Marylands #1-Rated 5-Star Golf Course.'' GolfTest USA also gave the course it's highest award, rating it an Elite Course'' in the D.C. area and one of the finest courses the reviewers have ever played. The course is also home to the McDonald's LPGA Championship, which is an LPGA Tour Major event. Practice facilities at Bulle Rock include a driving range and short-game area. The course also features a 23,000-square-foot clubhouse with views of Chesapeake Bay and a redesigned restaurant and new dining room, bar and lounge."

"Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Maryland","Maryland","Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in Maryland","Fort McHenry is located in Baltimore, Maryland and is one of the most distinguishable national monuments due to its unique shape. The Fort McHenry is shaped in the form of a star and played a major role in the War of 1812. During the war of 1812, British ships bombed the fort for 25 hours straight before ceasing their attack in frustration. It is estimated that more than a 1000 Americans selflessly defended Fort McHenry and it was their strength that saved America from defeat.  The determination of the soldiers and the stability of Fort McHenry helped to successfully defend the city of Baltimore from being demolished by the British navy. The fort never suffered further attacks after the battle but did remain an active military post off and on for a hundred years. It wasn't until 1925, that the fort was made a national park. It was placed on the National Register of Historic places until 1966. One of the most prominent features of the fort is the role that the fort played in producing the national anthem of the United States. Francis Scott Key was inspired to write The Star-Spangled Banner, a poem that would eventually transform into the song that embodies the spirit of America. The Fort is now owned and operated by the U.S. Government's National Park System. In 1939, Fort McHenry was designated as a national monument and historic shrine. It is the only historic place in the United States to have a double-designation. The war of 1812, the historic architecture of the unique building, and birth of the national anthem has made Fort McHenry one of the most prominent tourist destinations in the country. Local Baltimore residents flock to the area, using it as a vital center of recreation. It is estimated that thousands of people attend the monument each year. A Visitor Center located on the premises of the Fort gives visitors the chance to get acclimated to the history by viewing a short orientation film called the The Defense of Fort McHenry. The Visitor Center also offers additional services such as talks, and detailed walking tours of the fort. American patriots frequent Fort McHenry in order to pay tribute and respects to their fallen countrymen and nation. One of the most interesting things that occurs at the Fort are the historical re-enactments that take place by a group called the Fort McHenry Guard. The guard is a group of patriotic volunteers that dress up in period-costumes and perform a full re-enactment of the Battle that took place in Baltimore. Many of the volunteers of the Fort McHenry Guard are history buffs and retirees who are anxious to do the reenactment every September during Defenders Day. A celebration called Defenders Day is held at the fort every year. The event commemorates the soldiers who lost their lives at the Battle of Baltimore, and is the biggest event held at the Fort. The event includes a myriad of programs, activities, and a final fireworks display as a finale."

Outdoor climbers are more challenged, which many climbers prefer, and are able to get in touch with a natural environment that can not be fully duplicated indoors. Most outdoor climbers will tell you nothing can beat the feel of the sun on their backs, and the natural beauty of an outdoor rock climb. Those searching for an activity that offers fitness and fun, without having to worry about the weather, will love Earth Treks Climbing Center. The entire family can be challenged with a fun physical activity that may just instill them with the love of a new hobby. If you are interested in the adventure of an outdoor climb without the inconvenience of the climate, head to Earth Treks."

"Gardens Filled with Topiary Art","Maryland","Gardens Filled with Topiary Art","The Ladew Topiary Garden in Monkton, Maryland owes its history and heritage to a man named Harvey S. Ladew. He was a traveler, artist, foxhunter, and colorful figure in American cultural history. Ladew created the topiary gardens and had a desire later in his life to preserve his work for everyone to enjoy. The garden's mission is to maintain and promote the gardens, house and facilities in keeping with the creative spirit of Harvey S. Ladew for the public benefit and for educational, scientific and cultural pursuits.'' The gardens have been open to the public since 1971, and the Board of Trustees hosts a variety of events in order to help with the upkeep and maintenance of the gardens. There are 30 events annually including My Lady's Steeplechase Races, Children's Day, and a Summer Concert Series. Ladew based his garden design on various styles he saw in England and Italy. The year was 1937 and he had recently finished his work on his home and had a desire to move outdoors and create an artistic, peaceful outdoor retreat. He designed the garden to have two cross axes with garden rooms at the end of each axes. The denter of the structure, where the crosses meet, is the site of Ladew's swimming pool. Each of the garden rooms is devoted to a single color, plant, or theme. This was one of the garden traditions he brought from Englad and he was among the first Americans to plan a garden in this manner. In the 1920's when he discovered the art of topiary, he decided to recreate the look in his own garden. Strolling through the garden will amaze visitors with the exact effort of his topiary design. Ladew Gardens is a popular location for events and weddings. The Cafy and Cafew Courtyard are available for evening receptions. Those with a desire to hold their ceremony at the gardens can do so in the wildflower meadow. There is a maximu of 175 guests. Group tours of the gardens are available. Private tours are held April through October and require groups of fifteen or more. There are discounts available for tours scheduled for the months of July and August.

"Historic Garden to Delight Families","Maryland","Historic Garden to Delight Families","Sherwood Gardens is one of the best known destinations in the Baltimore area for a pleasant spring stroll, a place to enjoy fall foliage, and a great place for a delicious summer picnic. The garden is one block east of the 4100 block of St. Paul Street, and is convenient to a number of downtown Baltimore neighborhoods. Located in the Guilford neighborhood, the gardens originally were part of the estate of A.S. Abell, founder of Baltimore's daily newspaper, The Baltimore Sun. The land on which the garden now lies was originally a pond. In 1912 when the property was developed for housing, the pond was filled in, allowing the rich, moist soil to later be used for gardens. During the 1920's, the plot that was formally the pond was turned into a garden by John W. Sherwood. He was a local petroleum pioneer and conservationist and began the garden as a hobby. The tulips he planted in the garden were imported directly from the Netherlands, and as the garden has grown and become more popular, it has gained noteriety as the most famous tulip garden in North America. At the time of Mr. Sherwood's death in 1965, he bequeathed enough money to the city of Baltimore for one full year of care and maintenance for his garden. After that, the Guilford Association took control of the gardens and have maintained the gardens ever since. On occasion, the City of Baltimore contributes money to the care and maintenance of the gardens, knowing their popularity and understanding the value the gardens add to the area. Today the garden is home to approximately 80,000 tulip bulbs that are newly planted each spring. There are a variety of other spring bulbs included with the tulips, and the garden also features a variety of dogwood trees, flowering cherry trees, wisteria, and magnolia trees. There are also azalea bushes and Old English boxwood trees. The garden's bulbs are in full bloom from the end of April until the beginning of May. On the Saturday preceeding Memorial Day, the garden holds a tulip dig. As the blooms die off, visitors to the garden can dig up this season's bulbs and take them home for planting in their own gardens. Visitors pay for the bulbs and are required to bring shovels, spades, and bags to transport their bulbs. The following year, new bulbs are planted at Sherwood Gardens, allowing the plant, bloom, and dig cycle to happen again. Throughout the summer, the garden remains in bloom through the Adopt-A-Plot program. Colorful annuals are planted by area residents who maintain their small plots of land. The park is open year round, and has no gates or fences restricting access to the area. Winter strolls down the snowy pathways may be chilly, but will offer lovely views of glistening trees and snow-covered fields. Admission to the park is completely free.

"Historic Tourist Photo Opportunity","Maryland","Historic Tourist Photo Opportunity","The Phoenix Shot Tower is a landmark in downtown Baltimore that has been a part of the skyline since the mid-1800's. It is also known as the Old Baltimore Shot Tower and was originally called the Merchant's Shot Company. The tower reaches 234.25 feet tall and is entirely constructed by 1 million red brick. Completed in 1828, it was the tallest free-standing structure in the United States at the time and remained so until the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. was constructed. In 1971, it was designated a national landmark. Designed by Jacob Wolfe, the first cornerstone of the building was laid by Charles Carroll, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. When in operation, The Shot Tower was used in the production of amunition for pistols, shotguns, and cannons. Molten lead was dropped from a platform at the top of the structure. As it would fall through the tower, it would shape and cool, and would splash into a pool of cold water at the bottom. The water served to harden the shot into a solid piece of lead and it would then be bagged into 25 pound sacks. During a regular year, annual production was 100,000 bags. This number would increase during wartime. The tower ended its active production in 1892, but reopened briefly in the 1900's. It has since become a part of Baltimore culture, recognized by native Baltimoreans as a significant part of the city's history. It has long been a popular destination for school field trips, and is a great side trip from the Harbor or other downtown neighborhoods. It is a quick trip, and is an excellent photo opportunity.

Paired with espresso, this makes for a delicious afternoon treat after a visit to The Phoenix Shot Tower.

"How Antietam National Battlefield Changed the Civil War","Maryland","How Antietam National Battlefield Changed the Civil War","The Antietam National Battlefield is located in Sharpsburg, Maryland. The battlefield is the spot where Robert E. Lee's first attempt to invade the Northern Territories during the Civil War ended. This battle is considered to be the bloodiest one day battle in the country's history. More than twenty-three thousand soldiers were killed, wounded, or missing at the conclusion of the twelve hour battle. Historians point to the battle as the turning point of the American Civil War. The victory by the North gave Lincoln the momentum he needed to issue the Proclamation of Emancipation which banned slavery in the United States of America. Although the Civil War raged on the Battle of Antietam effectively ended the South's hope of winning the war. There are several things to do once at the battlefield and these include a self guided tour, viewing the monuments, viewing a film about the battle, and visiting the Pry House Field Hospital Museum. The monuments are especially impressive as they were commonly built by veterans of the ferocious battle. There were six generals killed in the battle and a memorial canon was placed at the spot where each general was killed. The Pry House Field Hospital Museum was Union Commander General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle. The exhibits that are shown at the Pry House Museum are accurate representations of what facilities were like during the Civil War.

"Hunters Oak Golf Club","Maryland","Hunters Oak Golf Club, Queenstown, Maryland - A Demanding Links-Style Golf Course on Maryland's Eastern Shore","Hunters Oak Golf Club in Queenstown, Maryland features 27 holes of golf, including a newer nine-hole Parkland course and the championship 18-hole Old Course.'' The Old Course was designed by Ian Scott-Taylor and opened in 1999, and features a true Scottish-style links design. While technically considered a private club, the golf course keeps its doors open to the general public. The par-72 Old Course plays to 7,072 yards from the longest tees, with a USGA rating of 74.1 and a slope rating of 135. The course is situated on the sprawling River Plantation in the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland's Eastern Shore, about an hour's drive from Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. The course features a myriad of links-style features, such as winding mounds, swales, bunkers, tight landing areas, blind shots, knee-high rough, water hazards, double fairways, and greens guarded by moats of grass. It's been recommended that, if golfers don't like such rugged terrain, they should find a course with flower beds, fountains and waterfalls.'' In fact, the Old Course is considered so tough and so demanding by mid-range and high-handicap players, that they've been known to label it as unfair'' and overly challenging.'' According to the local golf professional, one foursome claimed to have lost 96 balls in the water and grasslands the first year the course opened. Since then, as an aid to golfers, the course has placed aiming stakes in many of the fairways to try to lead golfers from shot to shot. A good example of some of the holes that can confound and befuddle golfers is the par-4 No. 5. This hole plays to 461 yards from the back tees and has been aptly named the Jester.'' From the tee, golfers have a choice of playing to either side of a fairway divided by a snaking creek that leads to a larger water hazard near the left side of the green. The left fairway is the obvious play, being much wider, except for the deep bunker located right at its center. For golfers who encounter trouble, they'll have to play to another landing area that features another bunker at its center. Since opening, the course has received numerous accolades over the years. The Baltimore Sun stated, Golf facilities have been built in the U.S. to resemble what Scotland, Ireland, and England offer, but nothing carrying the authenticity of what Scott-Taylor is doing. It will stand alone in the character it offers... and will offer something different - a vicarious trip to Scotland, Ireland, or England.'' In addition, Golf Digest ranked Hunters Oak among the Top 15 golf courses in the state, and Golf World hailed course designer Scott-Taylor as one of the Top 25 architects in the U.S. due to his work on Hunters Oak. The course also plays host to the LPGA Futures Tour, where players have averaged a score of 13-under par during tournaments. Practice facilities include a short-game practice area, and lessons are also available. Before or after the golf, the club's Dornoch House is an authentic Scottish Pub & Grille for dining and relaxing, while the stately Heathland Manor clubhouse features dining rooms and meeting areas. In addition, The River Plantation offers a look back in time, including two distinctive Bed & Breakfast locations. Other activities include sporting clays, hunting, fishing, and boating. There's also a fitness center with men's and women's locker rooms, a pool and tennis facilities."

"Peaceful Destination for Catholic Pilgrims","Maryland","Peaceful Destination for Catholic Pilgrims","The National Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes is one of Maryland's most peaceful religious destinations. It is located in Emmitsburg, Maryland and sits high on a mountainside. The grotto dates back to the very beginning of Catholicism in the United States. The space is linked to Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton and the shrine is one of the oldest American replicas of this French Shrine. The shrine attracts thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the world for meditation and prayer in the serene, holy environment. The history of the shrine includes bravery, religious strife, and ultimately, independence. In 1728 a group of Catholics seeking religious freedom headed west from St. Mary's City. Led by the Elders, they traveled to the Blue Ridge Mountains. Choosing one, they named it Saint Mary's Mountain and built homes in the valley below, calling it Saint Joseph's Valley. It was 1805 when Father John DuBuis settled in Saint Joseph's Valley. He constructed the church and as legend has it, was attracted to a light on the mountain he felt was blessed and one of the loviliest spots in the world. He erected a cross and the Grotto was born. In 1809, Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton paid a visit to the mountain and stayed with Father DuBois for six weeks. In 1812, Father Simon Gabriel Brute came to the mountain and took on the responsibility for clearing the area around the Grotto. It was Father Brute, Father DuBois, and Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton who became known as the trinity who cared for the Grotto. Over a century later, Reverend Msgr. Hugh J. Phillips gained the reputation of being the Grotto's restorer. He refurbished the Shrine and opened it to the public. He was appointed the Chaplain of the Grotto by Baltimore's Archbiship in 1965. It was Msgr. Phillips who made the place the peaceful destination it is today. Today, the Grotto is the site of spiritual retreats and personal pilgrimages.

"Resting Place of Edgar Allan Poe","Maryland","Resting Place of Edgar Allan Poe","The Westminster Church Cemetary is one of the most visited non-operational churches in the United States. Declared a national historic district in 1974, the church is the burial site of a variety of prominent Baltimore citizens including the cities first mayor, Francis Scott Key's son, and James McHenry, one of the signers of the Constitution. The church is located at 519 West Fayette Street, within walking distance of the Baltimore Convention Center and both Baltimore sports stadiums. The site of the church was originally only a graveyard. It was established in 1786 by the First Presbyterian Church which was a parish of some of the most economically and socially elite in Baltimore. Over the course of 60 years, the cemetary became the final resting place for statesmen, merchants, politicians, and dozens of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 veterans. In 1852, a church was built over the graveyard. The graves later became known at the catacombs. The church was built as a means of serving Baltimore's west end population. Their intention was to protect the graveyard which was at risk for being considered an uncouth manner of burying the deceased. Those supporting the cemetary and church wanted to leave the graves as they were, and decided that building a church over them would offer the protection needed to leave those buried there at peace. It was in 1849 the graveyard received its most well-known arrival. Born in 1809, Edgar Allen Poe is the author of macrabre pieces of literature like The Fall of the House of Usher and The Pit and the Pendulum. Also a poet, Poe wrote The Raven and The Conqueror Worm. Nearly 30 years after Poe was buried at Westminster Church Cemetary, an area teacher began a program called Pennies for Poe. School children donated pennies that were used to fund a substantial monument for Poe's grave. Buried with him are his grandfather, brother, wife, and mother-in-law. To this day, visitors leave pennies on his monument in honor of the Pennies for Poe campaign. The church is also the home of the Poe House and Museum. As the site of his annual birthday celebration, the church and catacombs attract a variety of Poe fans, all there to celebrate his life and work. Since 1949, a mysterious stranger creeps into the graveyard on Poe's birthday, offers a toast to the macabre author, and places a bottle of Martell cognac and three red roses on his grave. The stranger wears black, carries a cane, and covers his face with a scarf or hood. No one has ever spoken to this stranger. It is believed a new person began carrying out the tradition, based on letters that were left at the site of the grave, explaining the passing of the baton in respect to the family tradition. The stranger has even been known to creep in while the birthday celebration is in full swing. If you are a fan of dark tales, or possess interest in the literary arts, be sure to pay a visit to the Westminster Church Cemetary while visiting Baltimore. It is a dark experience you will not soon forget."

Pimlico can trace its history back to the 1660's when English settler's named the area in honor of a popular watering hole in London known as Olde Ben's Pimlico tavern. The racetrack is still sometimes called Old Hilltop due to the rise in the infield. The racetrack opened officially in 1870 and a colt called Preakness won the first race held there, The Dinner Party Stakes. Three years later, this race was renamed the Preakness in honor of this first winner. In 1938, the famous horse Sea Bisquit raced at Pimlico, beating War Admiral in the second race of the Triple Crown. Both the Preakness and the Pimlico Stakes are 1 3/16th of a mile. Information concerning wagering at the races can be found on their website. Preakness brings Marylanders to Pimlico in droves, some to observe the state's long tradition of horse breeding and racing, and those who want to celebrate with their friends and welcome spring gathered in the infield of the race. Preakness is now the second race in horse racings coveted Triple Crown, although they have often run the three races in different orders. The winning horse is presented with The Woodlawn Vase. The horse and jockey that sits atop the tracks weathervane is painted the colors of the winning jockey and they remain that way until the following year's race. The winning horse is also covered by the famed Black-Eyed Susan blanket. The Black-Eyed Susan is Maryland's state flower. Since the flower does not actually bloom in Maryland until June, the blanket is actually constructed of daisies with their centers painted black. The blanket is 18X90'' and takes two days to make. Those spending the day at Pimlico have a variety of dining options. The Maryland Jockey Club offers tiered-window views of the racetrack and is available to be rented to large groups.

In 2006, the first Virgin Festival was held and featured a variety of music acts on several stages throughout a full-day festival. In 2008 this became known as the Virgin Mobile Festival and the event continues to grow.

"State Park Great for Hiking and Fishing","Maryland","State Park Great for Hiking and Fishing","The land on which Cunningham Falls State Park now sits was originally farmed, hunted, and fished by a variety of small Native American tribes. The Catoctin Iron Furnace Historcal site operated from 1776 until 1903 and it was an industrial complex and bustling community. In 1954, the area was divided into two parks, the Catoctin Mountains and Cunninghan Falls. Since then, it has become one of Maryland's most popular outdoor destinations. The park is located in the Catoctin Mountain region and visitors often come for the 78 foot cascading waterfall. The falls are located approximately 1/2 a mile from the lake in the Houck area. This short hike is one of the most traveled paths in the park. The two developed areas in the park, the Manor Area and the William Houck area, both offer a variety of activities for visitors. Swimming is allowed in three different areas of Hunting Creek Lake during the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day. There are lifeguards on duty, but swimming may not be allowed every day, so it is best to call ahead to check the conditions. Electric motor boats, as well as other non-motor boats are allowed for a small fee. Canoes and rowboats are available for rental, so guests can enjoy time on the lake regardless of whether they are boat owners. Those who prefer dry land activites will enjoy the variety of hiking trails through the park. Trail maps are available and trail difficulties range from easy to difficult. For the safety of the hikers, no mountain bikes are allowed on the trails. Picini areas are offered in both the Manor area and the Houck area.

"Swan Point Yacht & Country Club, Swan Point, Maryland - An Upscale Golf Course Secluded in the Marshlands Outside of Washington, D.C","Maryland","Swan Point Yacht & Country Club, Swan Point, Maryland - An Upscale Golf Course Secluded in the Marshlands Outside of Washington, D.C","Swan Point Yacht & Country Club golf course is located in southern Maryland along the banks of the Potomac River, but the terrain may have golfers thinking they're in the barrier islands of the Carolinas. That's because the course is situated amid marshlands and trees, secluded from the customary hustle and bustle of the Washington, D.C. area. Water or marshland comes into play on 12 of the 18 holes, and it's also not uncommon for golfers to share the fairways with wildlife such as deer, osprey, herons, and even bald eagles. Originally, Swan Point Yacht & Country Club began as a quaint nine-hole course, but in the late 1980s it was expanded and redesigned by world-renowned golf course designer Bob Cupp. The par-72 course now plays to 6,859 yards from the tips, with a USGA rating of 73.1 and a slope rating of 130. Because of the overall layout, which is for the most part circular, most holes play end-to-end, with only a few holes side-by-side, giving golfers the feeling of being alone and secluded from the world. Among the more noteworthy holes is the par-5 No. 4, which is generally regarded as the signature hole on the course. The hole plays to 520 yards from the back tees and is one of the most scenic and intimidating holes on the course. Right from the tee, golfers will have to contend with the lake along the entire left side of the fairway as the hole doglegs around it. For long hitters, or those playing the shorter tees, the green is reachable in two, but that involves carrying the water to an island green, where even a short pitch requires some steady nerves. Another hole that tends to be a favorite is No. 6., a par-5 and the hardest hole on the course. The hole plays to 571 yards from the Black tees and another lake comes into play on the left as golfers approach the green. The fairway is also tree-lined and features a number of undulations, with the prevailing wind off the Potomac River typically playing against every shot. The approach shot is challenging as well, playing to a small, elevated green guarded by four deep bunkers. Another noteworthy hole is the par-3 No. 11. The hole only plays to 171 yards from the Black tees, 137 from the Whites, but the tee shot is all carry over marshland to the smallest green on the course. Adding to the challenge, the green is surrounded by a very long wrap-around bunker that will collect any shots that go short, left or long. Since the course's expansion and redesign, it has received a number of honors, including a 2007 Must Play Award from Pros N' Hackers, a Top 10 ranking in the state from Golf Digest magazine, along with 4?-Stars as one of the best courses in the Mid-Atlantic region.

"The Links at Lighthouse Sound","Maryland","The Links at Lighthouse Sound, Bishopville, Maryland - A Picturesque Golf Course Set Alongside the Tidal Marshlands of Assowoman Bay","The Links at Lighthouse Sound golf course is set alongside the tidal marshlands of Assowoman Bay off the coast of Maryland. The course, which opened in 2000, was designed by course architect Arthur Hills, who had as his goal to allow Mother Nature to show off her beauty, including views of the Bay and Ocean City skyline. The result is a course where ten of its 18 holes border the pristine marshlands found within the 1,000-acre site, while the other holes play through mature hardwood trees. The par-72 course plays to 7,031 yards from the back tees, with a USGA rating of 73.3 and a slope rating of 144 on Bent grass. Among the noteworthy features to be found on the Links at Lighthouse sound are water, shots over marshlands, an abundance of wildlife, great seaside views of Ocean City, and the longest cart bridge golfers are ever likely to encounter. The bridge, which stretches nearly 1,500 feet, carries golfers from the bay-side holes to the marshland side of the course. Some of the more noteworthy holes include Nos. 2 and 3, which both play to the same green and are the only consecutive holes in the country to do so. Hole No. 2 is a picturesque par-5 that plays to 508 yards from the longest tees. From the tee, golfers may choose to shorten the hole by driving over a lengthy water hazard, or play more conservatively to a wide fairway. A lengthy sand bunker picks up where the water hazard leaves off, running the length of the remaining fairway on the right. Once that hole is completed, golfers will drive to Hole No. 3, a par-3 that plays to the same green with a different flag. The 16,000-square-foot shared green is guarded on all side by marsh, bunkers, trees and water beyond. Another noteworthy hole is No. 5, a par-3 and the signature hole for the course. This hole plays to a lengthy 218 yards from the Black tees, but only 153 yards from the Whites. It features beautiful views of the water and the Ocean City skyline in the distance, and a dogleg right configuration that includes a forced carry over marshland. The green is only 18 yards deep and the ocean breezes may come into play, making this one of the most difficult par-3s on the course. Hole No. 7 is called the Devil's Elbow,'' and is as devilish as it is picturesque. This par-5 plays to a hefty 622 yards from the back tees, 516 yards from the Whites. It's been said that golfers might run out of golf balls on this hole, as the tee shot has a forced carry over marshland to a landing area bordered by water on the left and long. The second shot then plays to another landing area which features twin bunkers at its center. Approach shots must then carry a long, narrow water hazard to a green guarded by bunkers and marshland behind. The back nine holes transition to the St. Martin's River, and play through trees and more marshland, with some holes playing directly along the river. Practice facilities at the course include a driving range with 100 tees and a short-game practice area. Lessons are also available through a choice of golf schools. The course also features a large, stately clubhouse that houses the Lighthouse Restaurant, which overlooks Assowoman Bay and the Ocean City skyline, and features upscale cuisine."

"Unique Location for Camping","Maryland","Unique Location for Camping","Made famous years ago in the literary community by the book Misty of Chincoteague, Assateague Island is one of Maryland's Eastern Shore's most sought out destinations. It is the state's only ocean park. This barrier island is bordered by the Sinepuxent Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. It is about a twenty minute ride from Ocean City and is frequently a side trip from the beach town. In the park there are two miles of ocean beaches where visitors can swim, beachcomb, sunbathe, surf, and fish. There are no pets permitted in the park with campers, and there is a great reason why. The island is inhabited by feral horses that run wild on the shores and in the woodlands of Assateague. They have lived on the island for more than 350 years, and the story of their origins is varied. They were originally domestic, but grew wild after their release and through their subsequent generations. They receive no professional veterinary care and no supplemental feeding. The island houses no natural predators to the horses, and the only official interference in their natural existance is the occasional birth control program to prevent the island from growing overpopulated. Over the generations, they have developed a stocky build to enable them to navigate their marshland habitat and a thick coat helps them survive the frigid coastal winters. Those visiting the park may see the horses wandering free in just about every location on the island. In certain areas you are more likely to see the horses, so if they are the reason for your visit, be sure to check the park's website ahead of time. There are a variety of special events hosted on the island. Guests are welcome to camp on their own, but if they are searching for something more organized or educational, the opportunities are available. The Junior Beach Patrol is a training program with lifeguards. Kids can learn the responsibility of lifeguarding and the program will help them understand how physically taxing acting as a beach lifeguard can be. The Youth Group Environmental Education Program offers a variety of opportunities ranging from an island scavenger hunt to a coastal cleanup event. Campers can learn responsible environmental behavior and have a great time doing it. There is also a birthday party program, allowing kids age 4 - 16 to celebrate their big day on the island. April through October kids have access to a great outdoor event, and surrounded by nature they can enjoy crafts, the playground, and three hours of use in the pavilion. On the island is the Rackliffe Plantation. Constructed in 1752, it is one of the few remaining early plantation homes built by English merchant planters. It is in the process of being restored and will serve as a public museum and heritage discovery center. If your family enjoys getting back to nature, and you know your children would love seeing the feral horses roam free on the island, plan a camping adventure or day trip to Assateague Island."
